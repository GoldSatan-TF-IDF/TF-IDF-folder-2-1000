that descend in thunder rending the realms and the realms thereunder down through the world and down t he b allad of the w hite h orse prologue the swindlestock tavern th april and i say that youre a fool addison fletcher the brawny man declared striking his ale mug against the bare wooden table for emphasis god smite me where i sit if i tell a lie coll dawson addison protested his eyes flicking heavenward for the briefest of moments ah butdid you not say declared coll cocking an eyebrow and pointing a finger did you not say that you got this account from another from rob fuller piped a voice from the end of the table aye from rob fuller and whos to say that a tale told by rob fuller is true or false swearing oaths upon secondhand tales is not wise then tell me is it wisdom or foolishness to trust honourable men ive known rob this last twenty year and judge him to be a straight and honest man even so continued coll expansively an honest man may enough came a shout from the table next to theirs you bicker like a pair of divinity scholars i would hear the rest of the tale and judge for myself aye the tale came another shout from behind addison and the chorus was picked up by all of those in the tavern who were in earshot of the two men alright alright addison banged his ale mug on the table when a reasonable silence fell on the room he drew breath to speak where had i gotten to the blacksmith was working late on a moonless night when a man walked in a helpful listener prompted aye aye just so and full old he waswith a beard white as a cloud down to his waist and a red you described him already came a cry from another table and a red robe addison fletcher shouted a red robe that was bordered with all manner of delicate and intricate designs alright there was chuckling among the crowd anyhow addison continued quieter this old gent comes up to the blacksmithsam the blacksmiths name isand bids him good evening sam bids him likewise and asks what service he can give the old man the old man without saying a word hands him a bar of gold this big addison held his hands apart whats this asks sam i need you to make a shoe from this strip of gold that would fit a warhorse says the stranger and gives him the size which is large enough for a destrier the blacksmith sets to work andit being no especially hard task to shape goldhe soon has the shoe made he hands it over to the old man along with the parts of the gold bar that he hasnt used he does this thinking that hell get some of the gold in return and more of it if hes honest for in working with the stuff hes judged it to be proof pure but the gent merely puts the gold scraps in a pouch he carries on his belt and asks the smith to pick up his shoeing tools and follow him where are we going asks sam and the old man answers that the job isnt finished until the horse itself is shod with assurance that hell be compensated for his time sam falls in step alongside him well to hear sam tell of it they walk out of the town proper this was all happening in reading by the wayand along the river kennet past the abandoned abbey grounds and into the forest they go about a mile inwards until they reach a cave in the side of a cliff the old man ducks his head and walks in without pausing and sams right behind him trying not to lose sight of him in the dark its not too long before they come to a small room carved out in the rock in the corner of which is a large pile of jewelsrubies emeralds diamonds garnets sapphires and the like there are two grand archways in this small room leading to two large halls like feasting halls in one of them he can see men warriors all done up head to foot in armour and sleeping each laid out on the floor shoulder to shoulder toe to toe in the other room are horses massive warhorses all of them likewise asleep but upright and covered in fine blankets under which they wear armour and each one of them is shod with four golden horseshoes the old man enters this second room but sam is told to stay where he is and not to touch the pile of jewels as he waits sam takes in all he can about the place he ends up by counting the horses and reckons there to be about seventy or so well the old man reappears leading a listing horse down the centre of the hall and into the smaller chamber sam is told by the old man to shoe the horse and so he does all the while eyeing the pile of jewels and asking questions questions about where he is who the knights are and how the horses have been keptbut the old man doesnt say a word as if he cant hear sam well sam eventually finishes his work and puts his tools away the old man studies his work praises his handicraft and then hands sam a leather pouch sam opens it and finds it empty he asks the old man what it is you may fill this pouch with whatever gemstones you wish from the pile the old man answers but do not put anything of value in your shirt tool satchel or anywhere on your person else the knights will wake up and surely kill you fill it as much as you can but make sure that you are able to draw the strings shut for if you leave with it open the knights will wake up and surely kill you and i wont stop them so sam goes over to the pile as the old man leads the horse away and he starts cramming the bag full of precious stones hes sufficiently scared of the old mans tale about the knights killing him to not put anything on his person but also hes thinking that hell make a return trip here the next morning with the same pouch and carry even more away sam packs the pouch tight enough to just be able to pull the strings together and the old man leads him out of the cave once outside the old man turns to him and says that he may return to his forge but he is not to tell anyone of what he has done this evening the old man then goes back into the cave and sam walks home now anyone who knows sam knows that it only takes a prod to start his tongue wagging and scarce has he crossed his own doors threshold then hes gabbing to his wife about all thats just happened to him she finds this all hard to believe shes not the only one coll dawson said to the man sitting next to him but continued addison hes got the bag full of gemstones that he carried out with him he throws this on the table and says heres the proof the wife opens the bag and sticks her hand in and pulls out something small and hard and then lets go of both it and the bag what is this a joke she asks angry sam goes over to the bag and tips out the contents onto the table instead of all his diamonds rubies and such theres just a pouchful of old driedup horse droppings sam tries to tell the tale again but his wife has lost patience with him and makes him sleep that night in the forge women are unreasonable like that said a man at the next table the next day addison continued peevishly sam goes back into the forest to look for the cave but he cant find it he finds a cliff face that he thinks is the same place but it is just a blank wall of stone he keeps hunting around and finds a few caves but none of them go back very far hes gone back every day since sometimes in the morning sometimes in the night but he has never found the chambers of the sleeping knights again addison fletcher had finished his tale and marked it by taking a long drink of his ale so now he said wiping his moustache what do you say to that ive heard it before told just that way said one man from the back of the crowd addisons face brightened yeah yeah only it wasnt just an old man in red it was merlin himself addisons face fell and it wasnt just any knights the blacksmith saw but the knights of the round table waitin for judgment they were when i was on tour in the freincs lands said a grizzled man at the next table i heard a man tell it as with charlemagne who needed a golden spear but he was sleeping under this famous mountain like lies that is its dragons that live in mountains but what about my addison tried to break in nay ye daft bugger they lie on top o them argued the war veteran they fly about above the clouds in the day and sleep atop a mountain of nights and they all fell about to arguing over these and related matters until the bell rang for closing chapter one oxford is not safe eight years ago found manhunt for missing kids ends in scotland daniel tully and freya reynolds the two schoolchildren who went missing days ago have been found near kilmarnock in east ayreshire scotland alex simpson the son of a farm owner discovered them yesterday at pm both were covered in mud and displayed signs of severe shock and were disturbed mentally but were otherwise in good health when examined at st brides hospital by peter tavish md no statement has yet been made by the children a joint statement by the parents and the police describe themselves as joyful and relieved at the return of the children who will be driven to glasgow to undergo further examination daniel tully and freya reynolds also went missing on a class trip to a church in abbingdon in the british midlands over two months ago criminal experts are at a loss to explain continued on page now daniel tully sat unmoving and unnoticedjust another gargoyle on broad street a paper cup in front of him held fiftysix pence in small coins and there were two pounds in his pocket that meant either a proper meal or a bed in the night shelter he really wanted both he could try blagging his way into the homeless cafethe gatehouseeven though he was too young at only twenty years old that would give him a meal and he could buy the bed and keep the fiftysix pence for tomorrow spare change mate he asked a pair of business trousers the legs continued without breaking stride two other pairs of legs coming the other way stopped in front of him and he looked up two girls students stood in front of him and one of them was digging around in her purse she hastily fished out a couple of coinsher friend gazing sourly at her all the whileand dropped them into his cup god bless you daniel said both of you god bless you they hurried away the sour one berating her friend forwhat exactly daniel sat stoically until they dashed between the columns of the bodleian library then he leaned forward and inspected the latest windfall there looked to be seventyeight pence now that meant she only gave him twentytwo sighing he got up shouldered his overstuffed rucksack and started walking to st michaels street the bodies in front of him shifted opened and closed in their usual manner and through the ebb and flow a figure was suddenly revealed and then hidden againa small lean heavily tattooed figure that walked with an animalistic gait wide and lurching daniel froze his heart racing he pushed his breath out in a low whistle his hand instinctively rising and clutching at an object hanging under his jacket along his rib cage he gripped it so hard that his knuckles went white with an effort he opened his fist and started walking again he strode quickly this time weaving deftly through the crowd trying to close the gap between himself and the tattooed head he still had not caught sight of it by the time he stood underneath carfax tower the intersection of the towns busiest foot traffic he stood turning slightly as he rapidly scanned the faces of those approaching from four directions hopingbut dreadingto see the squat hairless head underneath carfax tower was another homeless man selling magazinesscouse phil daniel approached him with a nod alright phil eee our dan hows yourself yeah not bad not bad you aint seen a short bloke kind of thin shaved head tattoos that kind of thing passed by about ten minutes ago that who you were looking for over there cant say ive seen him that recently but yeah ive seen him about tattoos all swirly like but with lots of edges nasty business he is largin himself up throwin it around like god almighty violent got thrown out of the gatehouse a few times you got business with him not as such he was at the gatehouse hes on the streets where does he hang out dunno ive seen him a few times around the canals down near hythe bridge street doesnt keep regular with any company i know independent like name dont know a name best left well alone in my opinion wide berth danny wide berth listen if its some horse you want nah see you around phil cheers cheers then be well daniel turned and joined the crowd a glance up at the clock tower showed the time to be twenty to five the gatehouse would be open now he stroked his beard and turned his feet in that direction it was the busiest time of the day people crisscrossed in front of him ducking into shops doing afterwork errands before going back to their homes and dinners with their loved ones groups of touristsstudents on school trips all of them with matching yellow backpacksstood in clusters outside the fast food restaurants yelling at and flirting with each other and for the second time that day daniel caught a glimpse from within the swarm of faces of someone he recognised he stopped in his tracks it cant be he turned and looked at the sea of people she wasnt there anymore the tide had closed lurching forward he ducked into ship street a long narrow fairly empty side road there were two people at the far end and a solitary one walking away from him this person was younghis agefemale slender with black hair that was tied up looselyand she carried a bag that looked to be bulging with books a student then one hand dangled at her side and he could see that it was a light creamy brown he found his voice and shouted freya she didnt turn around or even break her stride but kept walking he shouted her name again freya come back without turning around she broke into a run sprinting away from him he chased after her he was only halfway down the street when she had reached the end and by the time he finally made it to turl street she was out of sight for the second time that daythat hourhe stood bewildered searching the faces in the crowd he wasnt surprised that she ran if she was a student then it may not be too hard to find her again but what did it mean first one of those creatures and now freyatwo people hed nearly given up ever seeing again the fingers of his right hand stroked the edge of a notebook that was tucked in his jacket pocket he would have to record these incidents later no time now he retraced his steps and cautiously approached the gatehouse spending a futile ten minutes trying to convince the lady at the door that he was over twentyfive when they both knew he wasnt in the end he asked for a plastic bottle he had to be filled with water and then he went across the street and waited slunk against a low brick wall he passed the time by trying to get his nerves under control but was unsuccessful in doing anything more than slowing his breathing the gatehouse closed at six its patrons trickling out singly or in pairs if the tattooed man was in there daniel knew that he would be noticed but almost certainly not recognised he hoped that would be enough of an edge fewer and fewer people were coming out now and daniel was about to get up himself when the tattooed man appeared he got a good clear look at him this time hairless dressed in a loosefitting tshirt and black leather trousers it didnt look like he was carrying any weapons except perhaps a knife in his pocket swathes of ink covered his body so broadly it was possible to think that he was naturally blackishblue with only patches of white his face was lumpy and swollen in the way that a continual scrappers usually are his features doughy and slightly formless his lips were curled into a thin cruel line and his ears were ragged torn he wore sunglasses that comically humanised him like a dressedup pet for there was now no doubt in daniels mind about the creatures true identity it walked towards him on the opposite side of the street although daniel couldnt see its eyes it must have spotted him though it gave no sign it continued walking and turned the corner okay okay daniel rose and followed but kept to his side of the street he didnt know how ruthless the creature would be how heedful of public places it would be so it was best to keep his distance for now he caught sight of his quarry again as it turned down george street towards the canals that led to jericho daniel followed lagging far enough behind to keep the thing in sight not caring if he was seen although it never turned or threw a glance behind it knew it was being tailed the sky had dimmed but it was not yet dark this was a time of the day that excited daniel but he willed himself to stay calm he tried to turn that nervous energy into a taut controlled tension and awareness if it was to be now then it was to be now whatever must follow must he stepped into the doorway of a boardedup corner shop to quickly adjust his clothing he unzipped his coat so it was just done up about an inch and hung loosely together in front of him he pulled his arm out of its sleeve which he tucked into its outer pocket shrugging and hunching forward he tucked his forearm into his stomach and gripped the handle of the thin cold object that hung at his side if he walked carefully enough hed give the impression of having both hands tucked into his jacket pockets it wouldnt fool anyone who looked closely but it would do for someone who was only giving him the briefest of looks stepping out from behind the abandoned shop he saw the shadow creature crossing the bridge ahead of him still en route to the canals he walked as quickly as he could without giving himself away briskly crossing the street and cresting hythe bridge he was just in time to see the thing take a right turn along the canal passing through a cycle gate it took him some time to get across due to traffic and when he did the tattooed man was nowhere in sight he slowed his pace and scanned the area the canal ran just a few feet to his left houseboats were moored intermittently along the side and to the right was wild scrubland not very deep but thick enough with brambles and tall grass to adequately hide someone in this low light undetectably right now daniels best shot was to keep himself out in the open and wait to be attacked he kept walking steady he whispered steady now as he inched forward he tried to hide his fear but then decided that it would be better for the one hunting him if he didnt hide it he tried to keep his breath even the seconds dragged on until he heard with a relief that nearly chilled him a faint scuffle on the path behind him he turned carefully keeping his left shoulder most visible and saw the creature standing off at a distance of about thirty feet it had discarded its sunglasses and tshirt and was crouching on the footpath half naked and wreathed in shadows leering at him lonely little light it said dim light faint light all alone in a city of one hundred and fifty thousand a fraction so infinitesimally small its hardly worth expressing statistically insignificant equivalent to nothing daniel wanted to reply to try to deflate its gloating pride but he was depending on the creatures conceit to survive the fighthe had to play the role of unsuspecting prey he set his jaw and narrowed his eyes bracing himself for the attack the thing opened its lips in a sneer revealing teeth sharpened into spikes it has been eightyone days it said since ive had a decent meal it raised its hands to show that it gripped two springloaded knives in its hands eleven and a half weeks one thousand nine hundred and fortyfour hours i will savor you i guarantee it licked its lips and then broke into a low frantic run daniel crouched waiting for it to leap it had to leap they always leapt if it didnt leap he wasnt sure of his chances daniel crouched even lower as the creature drew closer and just when he thought it was too late it pounced nearly twice its own height up into the air where it arced perfectly on course to land right on top of him he waited until it reached its peak perfectly silhouetted against the evening sky and then with a smooth lighteningfast motion daniels right arm came up through his open jacket grasping the hilt of a sword with a wide blade just a few feet long it stuck in the air unwavering perfectly placed to pierce the creatures chest as it fell the thing had only a fraction of a second before it descended upon the blade its eyes widened in surprise while its mouth was still twisted in hate as the sharp thin metal penetrated its torso the beast spasmed and dropped its knives in a smooth movement daniel brought his left hand up and struck the creature on the pelvis using its own momentum to carry it up and over his head flipping it over onto the pathway behind him it fell squarely on its back and as it fell daniel moved his arm in such a way that his sword was pulled automatically out the things chest he held it poised for another strike but one was not necessary there was a gaping steaming wound in the things chest that gurgled and spewed thick black lifeblood its throat worked desperately trying to breathe its eyes gazed distantly into the sky daniel kicked it in the head with his foot and then crouched down pressing his left hand on the side of its skull and putting his mouth near the creatures tattered ear listen to me carefully daniel said in an even clear voice if when you reach the dark smoky pit where you will surely burn in unending agony you are able to send a message to your friends through whatever infernal back passages exist tell your vile brethren this oxford is not safe he stood and with his free hand grabbed his slain victims leg dragging the body into the tall grass far enough so that it almost certainly wouldnt be discovered until the next day if not much later once hidden he bent and slit its throat just to be certain he wiped his sword as much as he could on the weeds around himhed have to go into a toilet somewhere and clean it more thoroughly when he had the chanceand replaced it in its sheath underneath his shirt then he went back and kicked around the dirt and gravel on the footpath to mask the blood all that done he walked briskly back the way he came feeling himself still glowing with adrenaline and triumph not too far from where the killing took place he found the things discarded tshirt and sunglasses which he casually kicked into the dark waters of the canal then he stepped out onto the busy pavement and the flickering yellow light of the street lamps which were just coming on when the body was discovered he thought they would not be able to identify it it having no identity the weapon that made the wounds upon the body was odd enough to be unique and unknown to anyone but himself so no one could possibly connect him to it the business looked fairly airtight still it was prudent to keep a low profile the next few days and perhaps steer clear from the night shelter where enquiring minds usually dropped by at some point his stride broke slightly as he recalled that he had talked to scouse phil about the thing and he chided himself but there was little he could do about that now a man coming towards him on the pavement fixed an odd stare at daniels forehead as they passed and then quickened his step daniel slowed and put a hand up to his face then held it out blood not his but the creatures he turned to the wall and rubbed every inch of his face with his palms drying them in his hair until he judged that he had probably removed as much of it as he could or at least smeared it to a thin red film yet another reason to find a stall in a toilet soon then he had to find a place to sleep that night then he had to find freya and above him from the rooftops dark eyes that had seen the city when it was just a wooden fortress and a church watched cold and passionless she used the glove trick to get into the coffee shop the practiced motion of pulling her hand out of her pocket to push the door open brought freyas woollen out as well she went through the door anywaypass oneand then put her hand back in her pocket her face registered puzzlement for a moment and then she turned and saw her gloves she went back outsidepass twobent down and grabbed a glove without really looking pushed back hurriedly through the doorpass threelooked down to her hand and realised she had only picked up one glove went back outside fourpicked up the second glove and came back insidefive five passes were enough in a place like this with lots of people but there were some places she tried very hard to avoid and some streets that she wouldnt even walk down being back in oxford made her nervous there were too many old doorways and arches the brickedup ones she came acrossin her colleges hallways in the sides of buildings and churchesmade her especially nervous and she gave them a wide berth she was going through her medication faster than shed like shed have to talk to her psychiatrist about that but that would have to wait five weeks until the end of term what would she do if she ran out before then she ordered a latte and took a seat it was overcast outside and she couldnt see the sundefinitely a day to be cautious her watch said she had about forty minutes until the lecture she had started chapter five of her introduction to moral philosophy book three times her mind kept racing ahead to the lecture at ten am and she hoped she could control herself this time the medication would take the edge off at least maybe leaving places was fairly safe especially with a lot of other people milling around so she didnt have to test the doorway leaving the coffee shop like she had to when she entered it from st aldates it was a short walk down blue boar street to merton street and then into the exam schools she circled around and entered via the main doors on high street which meant that she only had to deal with one set of doors to get into the building and then one more set to get into the room the lecture was in for both of these she pretended that she was waiting for someone to meet her checking her phone and looking around allowed her to repeatedly duck in and out of the doorways people would think she was lost maybe or a little ditzy but they wouldnt think that she was crazy at least the monitor in the entrance hall informed her that textual histories of prearthurian britain was in the large lecture theater called south schools she followed the signs that led her up a wide stone staircase with a bannister made of rose marble then she took a right into a large woodpaneled lshaped room and found a seat third row from the back scanning the room as students continued to file in she didnt find a single familiar face eventually the lecturer a fortysomething woman dressed completely in black came to the podium and cleared her throat a cough that reverberated from the speakers and echoed off the walls good morning everyone im dr fowler she said when the chatter had died down weve got a lot to cover this morning so lets get started the matter of britain is the name that we give to the works that form up the early pseudohistories of britain as told by the anglosaxon settlers orally and recorded by monks in the ninth and tenth centuries it should be noted as being separate from celtic legendsin this context predominantly welsh irish or otherwise gaelic legends although there was quite a lot of crossover as we shall see the professor tapped a few keys on her laptop and the board behind her displayed an image of an ancient piece of paper with nearly indecipherable text printed on it this she continued is the first page of the historia brittonum written around common era by the scribe nennius it is perhaps the oldest english account of the settling of the british islesand the originator perhaps of a lot of the confused and conflated myths traditionally associated with the settlement of britain myths that initially branched out of the trojan tales of greece which were also very popular in rome it is thought that the work was created for wealthy welsh families in the fifth century as a way to justify their claim to nobility and to cement their position as a ruling classand obviously has little relation to objective fact the tales centre around the legendary brut a son ofyes freyas arm was in the air her heart was pounding partly with anxiety and partly with anger wouldnt it be more reasonable to assume that those accounts are objectively true seeing as no other accounts disagree with them dr fowler shrugged interruptions were rare in this type of lecture but she was professional enough to take it in her stride there may be certain grains of truth within the various accounts but were you to read them closelyas im sure your tutor will insist you dothen the appallingly fabricated fantasies within them will show quite apparently now this brut fowler continued was a hero of troy im sorry freya said amid a swell of groans from those around her we know that britain must have been settled at some point why is it unreasonable to believe the tales which state that it was a group of exiled soldiersveterans of the trojan wars and their families i thought i was scheduled to give this lecture the professor replied the other students in the auditorium chuckled pointedly ill gladly change places with youi did quite a lot of this during my doctoral thesis so its old hat to me but why not take the account at face value because its completely unverifiablefanciful even why just because something cannot be proven true doesnt mean it isnt trueeven if its claim to truth is unlikely in fact its more likely that an improbable truth would be recorded than a probable one this provoked more groans and more than one request to shut up but reasonably it is unlikely that an account of settlement could have survived two and a half thousand years to be recorded by an obscure welsh monk if there were an accurate relation of settlement freya said her voice rising how else would you expect it to be recorded besides the fact that there are many other surviving corroborating independent reports not independentderivative you say that theyre derivative of a lost source because theyre similar but why cant they be similar because theyre all true the professor sighed and took a moment to collect herself she shouldnt have allowed herself to be drawn in she was falling behind schedule was this some sort of gag it makes no sense to spar with me about veracity when i have an entire section dedicated to authorial tricks or stunts of authenticity youve obviously read some of the material but if you understood half of what you know then you would realise how outlandish your claims are why the professor continued plaintively on the same grounds you could argue the case that britain was populated by giants as was also popularly believed and recorded i do argue the case on the same grounds freya said this brought shouts of derision from the other students and a couple of them slipped out of the hall to fetch the porter the history of giants in britain is too independently supported to argue credibly against accounts of giant occupation are recorded in nearly all of the brut legends as well as irish tales and sagas such as the fenian cycles acallam na senorach and scandinavian histories like the vatnsdal sagalet alone those recorded in the bible and other middle eastern histories as well as slavic traditions dr fowler snorted and then smiled this is a joke she murmured im talking about human interaction with giants in each of these cases freya continued not creation myths or rationalisations about the acts of nature these are oneonone encounters a man in a blue uniform was now standing at the end of freyas row beckoning furiously at her the class had dissolved into noisemuch of it directed at freya the professor seemed to be in a mild form of shock the porter leaned into the row and called to her miss could you come with me please if giants had existed freya continued defiantly in the way that they are reported to have been they would have left exactly such an imprint on history there are too many disparate sources all with the same interior logic no its impossible the professor replied closing her eyes and shaking her head there is no archaeological evidence for thats irrelevant freya shouted theres no archaeological evidence for anything until someone finds it absence of evidence isnt the same thing as miss the porter urged he had now come partway into the row and placed a hand on her shoulder i must insist that you come with me freya gathered her bag and rose thats no argument at all if we were having this conversation two hundred years ago youd say that troy didnt exist either but they found that didnt they then they thought twice about the socalled myths of troy the professor stood silently and patiently as freya was led out of the room in the company of the porter and then she resumed her lecture with the legend of brut she had to run very quickly through rather ironically textual variants in monmouths historia regum britanniae but she came through the ordeal in the end outside freya was enduring another stern and predictable talk that referred to the student code of conduct and the privileges and responsibilities of studying at oxford her mind was racing and she was angry though mostly at herself idiots they didnt understand things werent true or not true just because they wanted them to be history didnt follow the rule the most convenient is true but it was impossible to explain to anyone who didnt want to listen why did she even try that was the real question why did she even try this is your second warning the porter was saying not unkindly the next time i come in to remove you may be the last this is the sort of discussion that you should be having with your tutor freya nodded that was something else they wouldnt understand she couldnt talk to her tutor because her tutor wouldnt know what freya was talking about she wasnt reading english she was reading philosophy and theology okay the porter continued i can allow you back in if you promise not to talk or make a fuss can you do that freya turned without saying a word and went outside she was so wrapped up in her thoughts that she was a good way down high street before she realised that shed only gone through the doorway once on her way outside she stopped immediately paralysed by a building tidal wave of panic she braced herself against the wall and watched the people pass her on the pavement and the traffic rattling up and down the street oblivious of the terrible chaos that engulfed themthat existed in all things she needed order she needed to know that things could make sense that she could enforce her will upon the storm of existence she crossed the street twice and then four more times this calmed her and she kept crossing the street as she made her way into town why did she do it what did it matter what people thought and believed even if it was a lie what right did she have to burst the fragile bubble of unreality that people surround themselves with so long as they live happily what does it matter if they live a lie ignorance is a blessing it was futile to try to wake people up so why did she do it freya sighed she knew exactly why she did it she was so wrapped up in these thoughts that she almost walked right into daniel tully the one person in the whole city she was deliberately trying to avoid she held her breath and saw that he seemed to be so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he didnt notice her either she walked closely by him very nearly brushing his shoulder and then took an immediate turn down a side street she forced herself not to break into an immediate run if he didnt notice her by now he didnt have a reason to come after her freyas heart felt like breaking though seeing him like that clearly living off the street she had spotted him yesterday sitting outside the sheldonian theater begging she was in a bookshop cafe across the street and must have stared at him for almost an hour not sure if she should go to him or leave him alone if she did what would she say what could she say did it matter if she said anything and if it didnt then why should she put herself or him through the torture of awkwardness and so she just sat there oscillating between action and inaction and doing nothing on the verge of tears freya came a shout from behind her it was definitely his voice even though it was deepera mans voice now but unmistakably his her heart nearly stopped but she kept walking freya come back that was too much for her she broke into a flatout run she made it to the end of the street and did a quick turn left and then right not stopping until she reached the bodleian library which was students onlythey wouldnt allow him in there she managed to keep herself together until she found an unoccupied study desk sank into it head in her arms and started sobbing silently alex simpson of the northern constabulary pulled out of the muir of ord police station and started the drive back he was tired to the bone but there was an electric ball of energy in his gut that pushed him on he had changed out of his uniform naturally but he had pocketed his notebook it lay on the passengers seat next to him almost radiating weight and importance he pulled into the small driveway of his small cottage and let himself in going straight into his back study and sliding the elastic band off the cover of the black notebook he thumbed to the last page of writing he studied it for a few moments and then turned to the wall map it showed all of scotland took up most of the wall and had cost a fair penny today it would be working for him for the first time in several months he had managed to get some time alone on one of the office computers where he could access the ncs intranet until today he had been unable to peruse scotlands crime and misdemeanor reports for anything that lookedwell suspicious suspicious to him that is and finally he had found something missing livestock even killed and mangled livestock was no novelty in the highlands but that coupled with a percent bump in area crime and a percent rise in unnatural deaths in the last nine monthsthat was suspicious and worth sticking on the map running his eyes over the blue pins already spread across the wall he started to put red pins into the map around the highlands council area seven sheep reported missing and remains found on the farm of robert corbet near kildonan with no information on where the animals were found or known to be missing from he stuck three pins around the farmstead two cattle killed and found near the farm of mactire at braemoretwo pins nineteen more reports in the last four monthsa couple dozen more red pins next violent crimes and robberies a couple hundred of these in black pins it took the better part of an hour to mark them all next suicides perhaps the most depressing and again far more common than one would hope in rural scotland in the last six months forty fifteen minutes later forty more pins these ones yellow stuck in the map it was certainly painting a picture stepping back he looked at the nebulous whole of incidents spread pretty much at random except for a massive cluster of pins to the northeast in caithness it was a sparsely populated area which made the number of crimes even more remarkable the haze of red black and yellowat least half of the yellow pinswere clustered there around a mountain called morven which had a brightblue pin sticking in it alarm bells rang in his head he phoned his associate and asked him to come over it was important his associate was also a member of the highland constabulary and the only man in the world besides his father who was now very old and of diminishing facultieswhom he could speak to about these matters he put the kettle on and had just made a pot of tea when his associate knocked on the door and let himself in walking straight through to the kitchen ah tea he said the drink of the english of my people right what have you got to show me alex took him through and showed him the map on the wall and briefly explained the pins then it is clear his associate said gravely you must go and investigate make sure you go fully equipped it could be anything remember that cellar full of hobgoblins we found i must go but youre coming with me no i must go south i may already be too late but call me if you really need my assistance i dont think you shall and that settled it he had four more days until his break but he might be able to move that up he would have to call the sergeant tonight and he would have to get an early start chapter two the sleeping knights eight years before at seven thirty am the clock radio dragged daniel tully out of a deep sleep just another ordinary day ordinary and dreadful no today was differentsomething happened today it was his birthday this woke him up he turned off the radio alarm and climbed out of bed hunting around his room he searched for the cleanest and leastwrinkled shirt and trousers he could find and put them on then he pulled his school jumper over them and went downstairs he was the only one awake as usual and the kitchen table where he had once seen presents piled on top of each other several years earlierwas empty he wandered into the living room and saw nothing on the small dining table either he went back to the kitchen kicking his feet he put some bread in the toaster and started making coffee wrinkling his nose at the earthy smell as he spooned the raw dirtcoloured grounds into the percolator he vowed once more to never drink coffee as long as he lived he flicked the power button on wondering if his mum would think about him when she drank it and if she would remember what today was maybe hed get some extra presents out of guilt it was possible but unlikely he ate his toast and looked out of the kitchen window into the tiny sliver of a garden it was still quite dark he didnt like this time of yearhe had to go to school in the dark and also come home in the dark its not fair he thought and then because he could and he knew itd make him feel better he said the words out loud its not fair he wondered what sort of day it was going to be and then with a flash of dread he realised that today was also the field trip he also realised that he hadnt handed in his permission slip he went into the hall and rummaged around on the side table it must be herehe remembered seeing it yes stuck underneath a strata of bills and junk mail was the blue wrinkled permission slip with a blank space where his mums signature should be he hurried back into the kitchen and looked at the clock on the oven he had about five minutes plucking a pen from the mug on the counter he rushed back upstairs and stood in front of his mothers door and listened he could hear faint breathing he gently knocked on the door which was open slightly mum he said there was no reply mum he said louder there was a very muffled and tired moan whuh zit mum i need your signature on something for school theres a class trip today silence mum lve it dnstairs uhll sign it when uh get up daniel stood quietly for a moment he needed the signature now not later he thought about the first of the two options now before him he really didnt want to go into the bedroom and try to persuade his mother to sign the slip now he would probably have to actually push the pen into her hand and if he didnt handle it right there would be a scene also he was starting to think that there was someone lying next to her no it was far easier to do the second thing he hurried back downstairs and put the slip on the kitchen counter then uncapped the pen he was holding he looked at the paper for a second and then exhaled in a quick confident burst of motion he wrote his mothers name in a suitably grownup and illegible manner elaine tully he regarded the slip not his best work perhaps but it would do the trick was not in trying to make it look exactly like her real signature but in making it confident he folded up the paper and put it in his pocket no he reflected the real trick isnt the signatureits in making all the teachers believe that you were the sort of boy who would never even think about faking his mums signature and that meant as so many things in life keeping your head down he picked up his school bag fished out his gym clothes wouldnt need those and thought about signatures and permission slips where did they all go what happened to them were they all put in a file somewhere did anyone really check them would this little scrap of paper be scrutinised against all the others checked for authenticity by a man in a white coat with a giant magnifying glass in a brightly lit room by now there must be more of his fake signatures on all these different slips and documents than his mothers real one to the school office his forgeries were more authentic than the genuine article he was just checking that his keys were in his pocket when his eyes fell on something unusual he and his mum didnt get a lot of mail other than bills but there on the floor beneath the front door was a red envelope he was so surprised that he actually took a half step back and then bent down to pick it up he turned it over and looked at who it was addressed toit was to him someone had remembered his birthday there wasnt any senders address on the envelope and he didnt recognise the block capital handwriting on it quickly he thrust it into his jacket it felt like a secret and he wanted to keep it to himself as long as possible all the way to school he thought about the envelope it might be from nan his mums mum but she didnt really go in for that sort of thingshe was more forgetful than his own mother it could be from grandma and grandpa tully but he hadnt seen them in three or four years since the separation he could see that the coach was already waiting when he got to school he sighed hed actually prefer a day of the ordinary routine rather than having to navigate the chaos of a field trip for a moment he considered not going but last time that meant hed had to join another class for a daya dangerous and unknown social minefield he handed his permission slip to miss singh and got on the bus sitting down in the first pair of seats that werent occupied and sliding over by the window he sat there unmoving trying to be a part of the background holding his breath when anyone passed by eventually the coach was nearly full and he thought hed gotten away with it but just as miss singh had crossed the last name off her list a group of girlswho had already passed himcame back up the aisle and stood at his seat look said one of them if we get him to move we can all sit together hey daniel he pretended not to hear daniel he turned and saw callie johnson bending towards him hi do you mind moving so that we can all sit together where to he asked playing for time i dont care you little freak callie said in a low voice leaning towards him just leave the girls behind her giggled he heard one of them mutter the word outrageous daniel wasnt fazed im fine here he said find a seat girls miss singh called down the aisle callie johnson leaned closer into daniel move she growled or ill sit next to you and pinch your arm till it falls off daniel turned to look out the window girls find a seat said miss singh coming towards them move callie growled under her breath he didnt callie couldnt do anything else until miss singh reached them her last chance would be to protest the unjustness of daniels attitude and try to make the teacher move himwhich she might however as callie turned towards the advancing miss singh someone pushed past her and slid into the seat beside daniel this seat free mind if i take it thanks freya said callie appalled what the i was going to sit there if you were going to you would have already freya replied curtly miss singh had reached them okay girls find a seat now with no hope of being able to shift two people from their seats the group of four was forced to disperse with groans of annoyance thanks said daniel to freya once the coach had started and they were on their way no problem said freya callie and her posse are acting like real cows these days i cant stand them besides she said giving him a wide smile i know a secret i know you do said daniel its your birthday freya said in a low voice i know do you know how i know yes because its my birthday too freya said her smile widening even further happy birthday daniel said miserably remember when we were in first year together and they threw us both a party barely well i remember it she smiled did you get anything nice sure lots of stuff did you bring anything with you no of course not i did look freya pulled a silver necklace with a teardropshaped pendant out from beneath her school jumper its nice daniel said thanks its from mum and dad what did you get what is this all of a sudden you havent talked to me in a year and now were best friends if you dont want me here ill switch seats with callie no its fine im just saying so what did you get i told you lots of stuff look daniel pulled out the red envelope from his jacket pocket whos it from dont know said daniel havent opened it well go on then what are you waiting for daniel shrugged you do it he said chucking the card into her lap okay she said sliding her finger underneath the envelopes flap and ripping it open daniel watched as she pulled out a shiny card that had a brightly coloured picture of a dancing clown on it it was a kids card not a card for someone whod just turned thirteen do you want to read it or shall i freya held the card up and daniel watched a crinkled slip of heavy rectangular paper slide out the bottom of it and onto her lap she picked it up and passed it to daniel it was a tenpound note you read it he said folding the money and sliding it into his shirt pocket freya opened the card to daniel she read happy birthday from your dad thats it daniel said leaning towards her freya handed the card to him doesnt say much does he daniel gave a jerky shrug the last time i heard from him was three years ago today he sends me a card with some money in it daniel heard himself say those words and felt wretchedly sorry for himself three yearsthree whole years and then what ten pounds and a crappy card with a stupid clown on it with a mocking leering laugh his hands clenched and he tore up the card dropping its twisted pieces on the floor beneath his feet he turned his face to the window eyes hot tears threatening to drip down his face freya sat quietly next to him and didnt say a word until they reached the church daniel turned and walked down the church aisle stopping at a short wooden railing that ran wall to wall just before the altar his head was tilted as far back as it would go so that he could stare straight up at the ceiling behind him he could hear miss singh droning on about some stained glass window just around the corner no one could see him here there were stone carvings everywhereon the walls on the ceiling on the arches around doorways along the columns carvings of animals plants people and mythical creatures the arches leading up to the chancel were lined with dozens of carvings of sunflowersstacked row upon row like strings of rising suns on the large archway over the church entrance there were a mermaid with a sword two battling centaurs a roaring lion a king with a crown a face with a leaf in its mouth weird zigzag patterns and other bewildering designs daniel walked up the aisle towards the altar he felt peaceful here the anxiety and emotional chafing of the bus ride was becoming less painful gradually washing away marveling at this amazing building he felt part of something much much bigger than himself and he knew he was the only one who felt it it was like he understood what the church was feelingan old proud indifference to the chattering squabbling children who were walking inside of it it was as though all the shoving and pushing and jockeying for attention and importanceall these things that affected him so muchwere irrelevant to the enormous beautiful building it was created for something else behind the altar there was a small arch partially hidden in the shadows for a moment he thought there was a passageway underneath it and hearing the call to adventure he intended to follow it but when he got closer he saw that it spanned just a blank wall of stone the archway oozed antiquity and was crammed with interesting figures it must have been a doorway to something at some point on one side there was a knight wearing a pointed helmet and a thick beard in his left hand he held a round shield and in his right was a large axe with a long straight edge underneath him was a horse a dragon a lion and an ox opposite him on the other side of the arch was another knight a lot like the first but this one held a spear beneath him was something that looked like a dog or maybe a lamb a woman with a staff and then an eagle and an angel he sat down in an uncomfortable wooden chair beside the altar opened his sketchbook to a clean page and started drawing the figures on the arch he had just finished tracing the shape of the axe in his book when he heard a rustling sound behind him like the flapping of a flag a shadow fell across him and then quickly lifted startled he twisted around and looked up into a plain gothic window something had passed next to itflickered across it from outside but it was gone now he turned back to his sketch the light in the church was growing dimmer the december sun was setting now even though it wasnt very late at all he finished drawing the first knight and quickly moved on to the other he heard his class moving across the churchprobably to another windowand slouched back closer to the altar so no one would see him what are you doing a voice asked him making him jump he twisted around his eyes wide freya he exclaimed in a whisper flip dont sneak up on people like that sorry freya answered automatically what are you doing nothing daniel said moving his pencil carefully across the page what does it look like im doing youll get in trouble for wandering off freya said coming to stand behind daniel yeah then so will you why are you hanging around me so much she ignored him not bad freya complimented youre good at that im not really daniel said its just that i like knights i draw them all the time youve got the arm wrong just there its fine just a little long thats all he said reaching for his eraser anyway thats what it looks like on the arch freya sniffed and straightened up where does the tunnel lead to what tunnel havent you looked down it what are you talking about that tunnel there she pointed where does it go theres no daniel looked up and then jerked his head back in surprise there was a tunnel underneath the arch that wasnt there before good artists need to notice everything freya said crisply she walked up and poked her head through the arch the walls curved i cant see around it its odd though usually churches from this period dont have catacombs we should ask miss i wonder if it may have been madewait daniel brushed past her having packed up his sketchbook and walked into the tunnel where are you going it sort of spirals downwards he said stopping a short distance in theres some kind of light coming from farther on a glow he took a couple more steps forward i dont think we should go down there it dont think its allowed i dont care daniel said i want to explore he took a few more steps and put his hand up to the cold stony wall daniel stop freya said moving towards the dusty archway its getting darkwell be leaving soon one more reason to check it outwhen are we ever going to come back daniel said he turned to freya and saw her worried expression come on itll just take a second freya ducked under the small archway and they both started down the long sloping tunnel the walls were solid rock with little divots in them evidence they were made with a chisel weve been slowly circling around he said when they had been walking for a while if we go much farther well end up right underneath the church it doesnt smell old or musty said freya its sort of cool and fresh the ceilings getting higher daniel said and the walls are moving out feels like were shrinking freya forced a short laugh come on lets go back but we dont even knowhey look at that freya leaned closer to daniel to see around the bend on a ledge on the cave wall was a silver lamp that emitted a pale bluish light it was thin and cylindrical with a wide round aperture freya gave it a tap wheres its fuel its electric no theres no cord battery then come on theres an archway up ahead theres writing on it freya said daniel tilted his head back and saw carved above the archway the words ic wordcenne t niergeard giefe a lch wha boga nieweard gifu sprecan freolice if beo he solice freondlice do you think its latin daniel asked its really old looking no my sisters studying that this looks nothing like latin those two lettersthe p looking thing and the d with the line through itive never seen them before they gazed at the words trying to puzzle them out and as they did daniel was aware of a soft sound that he hadnt heard beforea gentle rhythmic sigh the sound of breathing do you hear that he whispered what shh gathering his courage daniel stepped through the arch and found himself in a perfectly square room with a very high ceiling made of rough natural rock in the centre of the room stood a stone dais holding half a dozen of the silver lamps and what the lamps threw their light upon made daniels jaw drop in the centre of the room lay two low stone slabs and lying on top of each was a knight in full battle gearnot carvings this time but genuine authentic largerthanlife men encased head to foot in armour they were dressed exactly as the knights from the archway in the church behind the altar in their left hands they held round shields made from some sort of animal hide stretched over wood in their right they gripped weaponsone held a spear the other an axe each knight was dressed in a chainmail shirt with long sleeves that fell low to cover the upper legs just above the knees each shirt was cinched at the waist by a stout leather belt from which hung a short but wide sword their lower legs were wrapped in rough cloth and skins joining dark coarsewoven breeches at the top of their shins pointed helmets polished to a shine crested their heads and long beards flowed down almost past their belt buckles wow daniel exclaimed freya gazed around the chamber with wide eyes what is this place she asked she walked closer between two of the figures i dont know daniel said it looks like some sort of display freya stared hard at one of the knights their faces look really realreally lifelike i can see the pores areare they dead no chance daniel said looking down at the knight in front of him nah theyre just models got to be theyre really good though look really authentic maybe theyre for a movie like lord of the rings they made models like this for that i saw the special features bending closer daniel gazed at the one with the reddishbrown beard and the axe looking closely at his nose and mouth he thought he saw the whiskers tremble around the nose stooping closer daniel reached out a hand and touched the sword at the knights side it was cold like it was made of actual metal come on said freya taking a step towards the archway weve had a look around so lets go back now daniel was still hunched over the knight daniel come on she moved towards him and put a hand on his shoulder to try to pull him around lets go alright daniel said reluctantly he knew that they were pushing it now this was definitely flying in the face of keeping your head down he turned to leave look whats that he said hanging on the wall was something he hadnt noticed when they came ina curved horn with an ornate silver mouthpiece freya rolled her eyes daniel come on hold on i just want to give it a toot no leave it freya you have no sense of adventure daniel went to the wall and pulled the horn off of the hook it was hanging on he pressed his lips together put them to the mouthpiece and gave a strong blow the horn let out a thin drawnout parp and had no other immediate effect other than to turn daniels face red the reedy buzz knocked around the chamber echoing reluctant to die daniel and freya frozewaiting expectantly but for what they didnt know maybe for some caretaker to come and tell them off satisfied freya asked can we go now yes fine daniel said sighing he placed the horn back on the hook strange he said sounds like its still going no hold up there was another sound in the chamberone that was growing a deep rumbling groan what is it asked freya nervously daniel crossed back over to one of the knights it must have been a trick of his eyes or the light or something but it looked like it was breathing he raised his arm and was just about to brush his fingertips against its cheekwhich looked more than just lifelikewhen the knights eyelids snapped open daniel was so startled that he let out a shout and jumped backwards colliding into freya who also screamed with a creaking of leather a rattling of metal and a groan the knight sat up and turned his head stiffly towards them dust cascaded from his chest billowing into a cloud daniel felt something snake around his wrist and then tighten he looked down and saw that the hand of the knight behind him was gripping his arm he leapt away trying to jerk out of its grasp but it felt like it was made of iron freya help me he cried terrified freya backed into the corner by the archway she opened her mouth to call for help but no sound came out then the first knight rose from his plinth the knight holding daniels arm shook his head and turned to the other knight col e cnihtas liss he said col e the other knight said something in more strange words and daniel felt his wrist come free but before he could make a move or even draw a breath the knight lurched forward and hefted himself to his feet daniel startled lost his balance and fell backwards dont hurt me he blurted and began scooting his way closer to freya the knight took a gigantic step forward and now stood directly above them the towering knight stretched out his hand calm yourselves children he said in a clear commanding voice peace daniel and freya frozen in terror could only stare at the knight he in turn gazed down at them cautiously and curiously as if they were cornered birds that might fly away at the slightest movement the knight with the axe still sitting on his bier lay down his weapon removed his helmet and put it to one side bending his neck first one way and then the other faith its enough to wake the dead their screaming he said rubbing his head his voice a soft rumble oh meotodes meahte my blessed bones he muttered his joints popped and cracked as he let out a bellowing roar ngyaaaargh has one ever been so stiff he patted himself down and coughed a few deep coughs as clouds of dust billowed around him hweat broor the knight with the spear spoke reading daniels and freyas terrified expressions would you kill them with fright beg pardon brother said the axeknight stretching his arms back to expand his chest which caused a loud popping sound i am thoughtless on waking the spearknight took a very small step backwards and also removed his helmet ah there now children he said relaxing slightly he leaned towards daniel on the shaft of his lance now lad theres a good lad tell me what might your name be daniel struggled to find his voice ddaniel sir he managed to stammer daniel tully a fine name boy he said very fine aye said the other knight swinging his legs around and off the plinth a name for a boy to grow into with a heave and a loud grunt he stood up and my little lady the spearknight said turning his head to address freya your name please freya reynolds she replied quietly a beautiful name for one who will quite clearly grow into a beautiful woman if it would please you elingas the spearknight said with a smile would you speak to us the year you want to know the date if it would please you daniel told him the knight broke into a wide grin ah do you see ecgbryt he said addressing the other we have slept past the second thousand you owe me your mothers golden gyrdel when i have found my mother the other replied examining his long beard disapprovingly and asked it of her it is yours swigar they both broke into deep bellowing laughter at this and after roughly combing through their beards with their fingers they started to plait their frazzled hair into more manageable strips as they did they recited a poem in a gentle singsong rhythm where goes you little eling in uncles leather shoes to see a holy man in rome and hear a prophecy where goes you little eling with brothers golden crown to talk to the men of the borderlands and share their winters ale where goes you little eling with hammer and with line to build a wall in somerset to keep the north wind out where goes you little eling with fathers rusty sword to split the head of a towhaired man who gave and broke his word where comst thou great and mighty king with glory might and peace from wessex on the mighty isle and i rule upon my knees the song seemed very strange to daniel and freya but the tune was happy and light and the knights easy laughter and joy at the verses put them more at ease whats an eling freya asked charmed by the song why a young noble person like yourself answered swigar with a chuckle you are both elingas oh said freya and then who are you two forgive me said the brownbearded knight picking up his axe and shield he knelt creakily in front of daniel and freya i am ecgbryt etchbrut echoed daniel aye ecgbrytthe name given to me by our warbands heafod it means shining edge i am called that for the reason that in battle it is all that friend or foe will see of methe blade of my weapon twinkling in the battlesun as it rises and falls upon the heads of my enemy he whacked the side of his axe against the steel rim of his shield making a loud crack and my name said the other knight kneeling also is swigar he whacked his lance against his shield it means strong spear my battlebrother and i have seen more fighting than many a warchief will see in a life even were he to live it many times over he raised his chin proudly and jerked it towards his weapon yet the spear i hold has never been broken nor lost to an enemy i found this wooden shaft myself and shaped it with my two handsit is my dearest possession sooth agreed ecgbryt it is no boast to tell that of all nobles alive in our age there were none better against a more bitter foe it is simple truth the evidence for those words is that we stand before you for it is why we were chosen is it not so a plain fact confirmed swigar with a nod though we are cousins they called us brotherswe are that much alike in war blood could not make us closer an aye to that hhow daniel blurted how long have you been here swigar began stroking his beard hmm we were laid to sleep in the same year in which lfred the geatolic died which would be ah blessed lfred ecgbryt sighed his eyes shifting focus englands shepherd and dearling he was the greatest king since arthur bear of britain so wise was lfred it was said that even the elves sought his council and more than this he brought all of the anglecynn under one banner we fought with him against the northmen the terrible dane jarls from their lands of ice the knights leaned in eagerly their earnest faces now close to daniels and freyas though on occasion defeated in the field we were not defeated in spirit and our spirits lent strength to our arms and our hands fell the faster in battle because of it swigar stood up but to put a number to your question i reckon we have been lying here more than five times two hundred years one thousand years freya exclaimed but thats impossible not impossible ecgbryt replied and stood up next to swigar just very uncommon and difficultespecially in full battle dress and stretched on a cold stone he looked from freya to daniel it makes a body a mite stiff an aye to that what are you going to do now freya asked well that depends on you young elingas swigar answered what are you to do now freya and daniel looked at each other we need to get back to our class freya said theyll be leaving now is that so said swigar in an odd voice back to your class eh back to those you belong to or who belong to you yes i suppose you could leave if you could find your way back swigar stepped aside and revealed the archway through which daniel and freya had walked it was completely sealed up no freya moaned they both rushed forward and pressed their hands against the stone which was now under the bevelled archway as if it had always been there they tried to find a crack or seam that ran along the edge that might suggest it was actually a stone door that had closed or slid shut they pushed it banged it tapped it thumped it and kicked it but it did not respond in the slightest it was cold solid and immovable youll not be going back that way ecgbryt said when didhow did this happen freya gasped there was a passage here a tunnel where did it go the sun will have set by now swigar said that is a special wall it only opens at a certain time and for certain people i dont understand freya said when the sun has just gone below the earth but there are not yet any stars out that is the time when the wall may openunder certain circumstances we needwe have to get out freya said starting to panic i have to get home calm yourself little eling ecgbryt soothed that is not the only way out ecgbryt stepped aside to reveal a plain tunnel that had opened in the wall opposite daniel and freya dashed over to it there was no archway just a gap in the wall about the height and width of one of the knights that wasnt there before freya stated are you so sure yes where does it lead asked daniel it leads to the underground city of niergeard swigar said he moved close and placed a large heavy hand on daniels shoulder it is the only portal youll find here the only way out we must take you there young daniel and young freya aye agreed ecgbryt pulling a burning log from the brazier holding it like a torch and its past time we started to cover ground chapter three that time we saved the world now hed kept his pace and turned his head to show what he felt was the expected amount of interest for a passerby to give a crime scene then he took a turn down hollybrush road another at st thomass street and then up worcester street he wondered where it would be best for him to lay low the police kept a pretty accurate and uptodate social map of the oxford indigent community he knew it was starting to look like a cold sleep in port meadow tonight maybe then hed think about walking up to abbingdon or even reading but it was while walking down walton street that he noticed a couple of officers were following himat least he felt like they were following him they were walking the same street as he was which was long and busy it could be a coincidence he thought or perhaps not he was just replotting a route that would take him out of their direction when he heard a familiar voice call his name he turned and saw freya waving at him she wasnt wearing a coat or jacket daniel backtracked and came to stand near her hi um she said wrapping her arms around her chest and huddling against the cold ive got a table in there freya motioned to a cafe with red trim and largepaned windows can i buy you a drink daniel looked past her at the two policemen walking leisurely up the street and nodded freya smiled at him good they entered and went up to the counter what would you like tea hot tea anything to eat daniel shrugged he was famished but didnt want her to know that the toasted sandwiches are good how about one of those ham and cheese daniel nodded cool why dont you sit down im over there she pointed to a table near the window daniel turned and went to the table he pulled out one of the rickety wooden chairs and lowered himself onto it there was a pile of books stacked haphazardly next to an open laptop he looked at their spines when was the last time hed read a book he picked up the one lying on top it was a thin small white bookan untranslated study edition of the wanderer he opened it paged past the introduction and started to read the poem freya joined him shortly bringing a large mug of steaming tea with her she placed it in front of daniel theyll bring the sandwich to us when its ready so she said uncertainly closing her laptop howve you been daniel looked at the pile of books on the table what are you studying uh philosophy and theology at pembroke which is this daniel said flipping through the booklet philosophy or theology freyas brow tightened thatsjust for me daniel nodded and put the book back on the pile and focused on his tea he poured some milk into it from a small pitcher on the table then he started adding sugar freya leaned forward and put her chin in her hands they sat in silence for a little while freya looking at the table daniel sipping from his tea until it was cool enough to take large gulps from the sandwich arrived and freya shifted things on the table to give daniel room to eat he asked for some mustard and the waiter brought it so she said ive seen you on the street i called to you once i heard you but i wasnt ready to see you daniel nodded and took a bite of his sandwich what happened she asked daniel chewed for a moment things got kind of rough with mum me being missing was really hard on her things were better when i got back and then they got worse i think in a way she really enjoyed the attention she got when i was goneshes still got the newspapers with all the headlines from that time and when we turned up again she was overjoyedthere were interviews and photo shoots for a couple weeks and then theythe newspapersstopped calling and a couple days after that they stopped returning her calls she went through her first wave of depression then i learned to stay out of her way nothing i could do would make her happy shed start things with guys shed meet fromanywhere i guess those never ended well then as you know i did an apprenticeship instead of a levelsi wanted to start making money so i could get out of there that fell through and i couldnt get any more work i joined the army the regular army for a year or so that was a problem for me i left and ive been on the streets for about six months now freya couldnt look at daniel she was finding it work enough to breathe past the lump in her throat im sorry she said i had no idea all that time its alright you couldnt have done anything its like what they say about falling through the cracksexcept it felt like i fell through one huge crack that i had no way of getting across ill get out again somehow daniel finished one half of the sandwich and picked up the other so how have you been freya drew a deep breath and leaned back in her chair oh you know cant complain daniel laughed a free and easy laugh no seriously seriously not much i did my a levelshistory religious studies and philosophyand managed to get into oxford i took a year out and earned some money so that i could travel mostly around france and thats it daniel nodded and finished eating his sandwich you ever think about it daniel asked with a grin that time we saved the world freya frowned i try not to why itd be different if i could talk to someone about it but as i cantive got to keep everything inside of myself im still in therapy for myshe drew another deep breathhabits why freya looked up locking her eyes with his that wasnt a happy time of my life it was probably the worst thing ive ever gone through daniel wiped his lips with a paper napkin and put it in his pocket it was the best time of my life its been all downhill after that well im sorry for you then freya said pushing back and wrapping her arms around herself or happy for you whatever freya daniel said do you ever think of going back she tried to answer but her lips clamped down immovable like concrete she shook her head i have lots of times ive been back to that church we visited lots of times ive poked around in the evening dawnand nothing but its important that we try to get back ive been thinking and i think somethings happeningsomething to do with what we did ive been seeing i dont know signs if we went back we could ask what they mean daniel leaned in in a low voice he said i killed a a youknowwhat two weeks ago i think ive seen more of them around i think im being followed ive seen shapes on rooftops daniel studied freyas face for a reaction there wasnt one she was still frowningbut her face seemed harder somehow stiffer thats not funny freya i thinki think there are things still left to do were not done look he said drawing his notebook out of his jacket pocket remember what modwyn said about evil invading the country ive been keeping a log of the bad things that have happened in oxfordjust in oxfordin the last eight weeks see look at this chart freya closed her eyes her stomach was queasy she felt like she was in a very small space with tall walls that were quickly deteriorating and behind those walls an ocean of fear that would come flooding through at any moment she knew daniel was still talking but she couldnt hear what he was saying he had to stophe had to shut up she said in a small voice where we came out that wasnt an enchanted site we find alexander simpson again shut upshut up i said shut up freya violently slapped the table several times with the palm of her hand then she leaned over the table buried her face in her hands and started sobbing daniel fell silent as did the entire cafe eyes turned towards them concerned daniel looked around and smiled the manager scowled at him from behind the counter his look said that although a homeless man was tolerated here so long as he paidhomeless men who disturbed his customers most certainly were not palms outwards daniel slowly pushed his chair back and rose you know daniel said as he slid past freya if you ever wanted anyone to talk to you could have talked to me daniel pushed through the door and headed out into the evening rain freya sat guiltily fidgeting with one of her books then she abruptly stood and chased after daniel im sorry she said i didnt mean to yell it just all came back really quickly she stood there shivering in the sleet without her jacket her arms were wrapped around her stomach as she hunched her shoulders against the cold the gentle shower fell on her face making it slick wet she lifted a hand to brush a bead of water from her brow thats alright daniel said im sorry i upset you listen ive got to do something tomorrow do you mind if we meet the day after we can talk about whatever you want to then i suppose that would be alright theres a church in summertown near where i livest michael and all angels can you be there at four so we can miss the twilight yes okay ill see you then okay see you then freya left and entered the coffee shop again hardly aware that her compulsions seemed to leave her when she was around daniel robin ploughwright lord of the boggy marshes and eighteenth earl of shotover hilla portly rotund figurepulled a pocket watch from his large purple waistcoat and marked the time even though the sky was overcast light from the setting sun reflected upon the casing and threw a ray of goldenred upon his round face he squinted one eye at it then closed the antique up and deposited it back into his pocket not much longer now the street that he stood on did not technically have a name but had appropriated the title george street mews although a public right of way it was rarely used too small for cars to enter and too winding to be a shortcut between two places that few people wanted to go to anyway his sharp hearing didnt detect anyone at either end of the long passageway he wouldnt be disturbed he allowed himself a smile he was happy to be back in oxfordshireeven if he did have to wear a different skin the place always comforted him it was little more than a swampy basin really even after all these years because of the hills surrounding it the sun set early and because of the builtup marshland covered rivers and hidden canals flowed through many amusing areas of the city and then there were the peoplea tidal force in themselves half of the year the population swelled with the arrival of the students when those left the tourists descended from the skies and always throughout there was the steady pulse of ordinary people trying to scratch out an existence living and dying ebbing and flowing it was a city of fluxalways moving from one state into another and so never really changing at all a town rife with opportunities robins smile twisted into a frown come now surely it was time how much longer did he have to ah there it was the stone face in front of him shifted soundlessly to reveal a doorplain ordinary and painted blue it bore the number b above a castiron knocker a small flap for letters and a worn stone step apart from the fact that it hadnt been there eight seconds ago it was completely unremarkable robin produced a key and opened the door which admitted entry not into a building but into a sparse courtyard containing a hill the high blank stone walls crowded the hill which might properly be described as no more than a mound except that there was a luscious covering of bright green grass that was dotted with bluebells and buttercups from the far side a dead withered tree protruded it had grown once but had not bloomed in several thousand years robin ploughwright lord of the boggy marshes and eighteenth earl of shotover hill shut the door up behind him and turned to the hill which was growing blue and cold in the falling twilight he found its entrance easily and went in the air inside the hill was musty and wetit obviously hadnt been aired recently still he wasnt setting up a guesthouse he was here on business the way was dirty and he had to dodge many lowhanging roots before he came with obvious relief to the meeting hall a small bonfire had been prepared and he drew near it trying to hide his trepidation he swallowed a mouth of bitter saliva and turned his eyes to the platform the throne was occupied he flashed a smile and tried to will himself to stop twitching sweating and mumbling his eyes flicking rapidly to and from the four armed guards surrounding the seated figure who blended perfectly into the shadows this unassuming person was dressed in a casual white shirt unbuttoned at the top a blue suit jacket jeans and brown loafers his hair was white and flowing but his skin was uncreased robin bowed hastily greetings glorious grinner he said smiling the man in the throne shifted his weight ploughwright he acknowledged what news i have proceeded as you instructedas we agreed all is in place i await your word i give that word now put the plan into action ploughwright turned his head slightly and regarded the man on the throne he was obviously in earnesthe was always so drearily in earnest very well it will be as you say the man on the throne made a gesture permitting him to leave robin had walked a few steps when he turned with respect he said i know i shouldnt questionnever have before but i must ask why not simply kill them or detain them in a more conventional manner he held his breath to await replyor punishmentfrom perhaps the only man in the world whom he truly feared the man on the throne raised a hand to his chin robin nearly flinched at the action really robin he said is that any way to treat a friend robin bowed and turned he didnt expect an answer anyway he never should have said anything he retraced his steps quickly and drew the watch out of his pocket once more good the door would still be open no need to make other arrangements exiting the hill he swiftly made his way through the blue door and back into george street mews and since there was still no one in sight he stretched out his arms and scaled the wall slinking along the rooftops he made his way back to the rooms he occupied where he lived under the disguise of a human at a quarter past two freya started off for her tutorial she left the coffee shop and made her way to her tutors room using the most populated streets she ran into julie the other student she was to take her tutorial with just outside the college freya was angry with herself for arriving on time if she were just a little earlier she would have been able to enter and reenter the doors and arches the arches especially upset her fighting anxiety freya mounted the stairs ahead of julie reaching the door of the tutors room she knocked and reached into her bag for her tutorial gown she pulled it out deliberately bringing some papers with it she bent down to collect them as they heard come in please from inside the room you go ahead freya said to julie deliberately picking her bag up the wrong way around to spill some of her books onto the floor ill help julie said bending down no thats fine ive got it freya said harsher than she had meant julie nodded stood and entered freya stuffed the books in her bag and then took a bottle of pills out of an inner pocket she dryswallowed a couple and then went to a window in the hallway where was the sun the sky had become overcast but it wouldnt set until around five thirty this time of year surely the tutorial wouldnt drag on that long but it might she took a deep breath one crisis at a time she opened the door and went in and out of it as fast and as silently as she could seven times that did absolutely nothing to calm hershe had gone through too many arches already the only thing that could help was if she went back to the street and started again fresh she closed her eyes and started to massage her forehead the door clicked shut behind her making her jump im sorry did i startle you a little freya saw professor stowe her tutor standing just inside the doorway his face was concerned its okay im a little anxious because i thought i would be late no dead on time as usual shall we start he gestured to the sitting room where julie was already settling herself freya bustled into the next room and sat on a small uncomfortable wooden chair next to julie facing professor stowes leather wingbacked chair the next fifty minutes were dedicated to the discussion of freyas and julies essays on determinism julie got high praise for hers while freya had all the flaws and bad reasoning pointed out in hers she stopped taking notes when he started critiquing her sentence structure eventually stowe got down to the end of the paper and paused long enough for her to assume that hed finished alright she said her voice quavering just slightly feeling very much under attack youve told me all the things i shouldnt do what are the things that i should do the professor smiled at her address the essay title he said tossing her back her essay it was creased and glossed over completely in red ink stay focused be relevant do better freya was fuming she ostentatiously checked her watch yes youre right stowe said were finished now he set the reading and essay titles for next week and rose from his chair as julie and freya packed up freya if i could have a word in private with you the two students made eye contact ill wait for you outside julie said and left i just wanted to say professor stowe said standing behind his wingbacked chair and leaning forward on it that you are without a doubt one of the smartest students in your current yearperhaps the smartestand that is why i was so tough on you i dont understand professor stowe turned his head rather theatrically to gaze out of the window and said the problem with your essays is that you are trying to advance the reasoning of the field trying to arrive at some conclusion whereas your only goal is to display an evidence of having read the material and to some degree retained it and understood it were not looking for a breakthrough we dont want to revolutionise the fieldhe slid his eyes away from the window and back to herjust yet freya considered this so so for now you need to toe the line i never want to discourage original thought but the truth is that this is the wrong forum for that youll want to save all that for your doctoral thesis but in order to get there you need to finish your graduate degree and for that youll need to barbaric as it sounds simply follow the herd or lead it if you can this isnt the time for individual thoughtit is the place for it but not the time yet do you follow thats an ironic comment to come out of an essay on determinism professor stowe laughed his eyes creasing merrily see youre obviously brilliant all things in their places thats all im saying professor stowe straightened and went to stand by the window i believe youve got a shining career ahead of youyouve an excellent academic mind but you have to maintain distance were scholars of philosophy and theology not practitioners after all you must maintain the perspective of the outsider freya didnt agree with this at all and opened her mouth to protest but professor stowe held up a hand and turned his face to the window now the other thing i wanted to talk to you aboutcome over here for a second please look down there freya cautiously crossed the room to the window that looked down on the street see that man opposite us sitting on the pavement freya craned her neck there was a form huddled against the wall of the house across from them that looked to be daniel do you know him freya nodded yes thats an old friend of mine i was at school with his name is daniel correct yes did you know he was following you no i first noticed him sitting outside here three weeks ago hes quite a notorious figure in oxford i used to volunteer at the night shelter a few years ago he was banned for violent behavior a couple weeks ago i saw him walking down the street with blood on his face has he approached you yes like i said we were at school together i would never advise a student on their personal life but i would ask you to consider your involvement with him very carefully and treat him with great trepidation there is little doubt in my mind that he will want to exploit your past friendship it wont seem like that initiallyhell want to earn your confidence at firstbut gradually hell make more and more demands of you which youll find increasingly difficult to refuse freya felt anxious she thought about her agreement to meet daniel later on that day if you like i can ring the police and have them caution him no freya said thats fine illkeep an eye on him have you planned to meet him again freya was going to deny that she had but then felt childish she nodded her head we arranged to meet in a church st michaels in summertown i dont think thats wrong but if i might advise youmiss the appointment just this once to let him know that you have your own schedule okay ill consider that good i just want you to be safe thats all i know thanks freya shouldered her bag and moved to the door she waved goodbye and then joined julie outside in the hallway what was that about she asked nothing he just wanted to give me a little more feedback more he was pretty harsh in there no hes okay really they walked off into the oxford gloom daniel spied the police officers when he was already mostly down st michaels street they were standing outside of the gatehouse and although that wasnt a common sight it wasnt particularly rare eitherit just meant that he wouldnt be able to nag the staff about getting in the coppers were talking to some of the guests while the staff stood in the doorway someone turneddaniel now recognised him as scouse philand called out johnny johnny boy wait up daniel slowed and looked behind him there was no one around him but phil was definitely talking and walking directly to him keep walking phil said in a lower voice once he was nearer dont look around just smile and greet me daniel jerked his head upwards and slapped phil on the arm as he came to walk alongside him one of the police officers turned her head to study daniel and phil her face registered them disinterestedly and then turned back to the group are you in trouble like danny those officers there want to talk to ya thought yad want to be told have ya done anything any of us should know about daniel only frowned and shook his head wes got to stick together right i wouldnt tell them about youjust like you wouldnt tell them about me right i scratch your back and we wash each others hands right of course daniel said trying to sound reassuring champion well best lay low awhile and stay out of the usual haunts just for a few daysthats as long as the pigs usually stay interested sure cheers phil be seein ya danny boy they had reached the end of the street and they split daniel headed towards george street planning a route of escape and then realised with a start that today was the day he had arranged to meet freya he had to make his way up to summertown and dodge the police that were prowling for a vagrant matching his description at all costs he would have to avoid the canal where hed made his kill which would have been an ideal route otherwise that left jericho as a possibility though not a great one he was just going to have to stick to the side roads and chance it a couple nerveracking hours later he made it he tried to stick to streets with a lot of parked cars on them for cover of course that thinned out the farther he went into affluent north oxford but there was more street parking as soon as he crossed marston ferry road into summertown now he pushed open the wooden lychgate of the church of st michael and all angels and stepped into the churchyard passing row after row of worn weathered tombstones he thought all these people came before me with lives nearly as big as my own he twisted the oversized iron ring that hung on the large double doors of the church which responded with a half turn and a sharp clack pushing the door open he stepped inside the church was rather plain as churches go he was still cold but warmer for being out of the wind and the rain he slid into a pew and closed his eyes he was tired and began to nod off there was the thump of something flat hitting the stone floor daniel turned and saw a thin old man with dusty grey hair standing near the door of the church he clutched a handful of narrow slips of paper and was inserting them into a stack of order of service books he smiled made an apologetic face and bent to pick up the book hed dropped daniel studied him for a moment was this man going to make him leave or was he just keeping an ostentatious eye on him this man could make trouble for him if he wanted to perhaps it would be better to wait for freya outside he stood and started to make his way out to do so he passed the old gentleman who looked up smiling can i help you im just leaving daniel said thats not what i asked i said can i help you no im fine daniel said and turned to go hold up a bit the old man said reaching into his back pocket he withdrew a wide leather wallet removed a bank note and gave it to daniel no thanks im fine daniel said looking at the square of paper the old man took daniels wrist and shoved the money between his fingers daniel kept his eyes on itthere was something odd about the way it looked is there anything else what daniel asked you didnt come in here to ask for money daniel couldnt work out if the note was for five pounds or ten the colours in this low light seemed to be somewhere between was it for fifty the mans words registered then sorry what did you come here for i was waiting for someone oh do they attend this church daniel examined the note more closely the shapes didnt seem to add up he pulled it tight and held it steady i dont know what is their name there was something wrong with what he was holding his arm stiffened as he thrust the money back at the man here take this i dont want it but you asked me for it no i dont need it its too much too much i dont understand take your money daniel yelled at the old man but i didnt give you money what daniel looked down at his hand he was holding one of the slips of papera notice sheetthat the man had been inserting into the books oh he tried to read it but couldnt come back and see me if you like ill be here okaythanks daniel shoved the paper in his pocket and left he hurried down the church path towards the street he looked past the wooden lychgate and to the street there was a familiar figure approaching himfreya he raised a hand to greet her and saw a shape slide out from behind a privet hedge behind her no daniel shouted breaking into a run he barrelled through the wooden gate and suddenly felt himself falling forward the ground was no longer where it should have been he didnt fall far but landed with a jolt that knocked the air from his lungs when he raised his head he saw that the sky was clear now and the sun was shining not a cloud in the sky he was lying in the middle of a wide field of green grass and there wasnt a building in sight chapter four the knights of niergeard before im not going said freya gazing into the dark fathomless anonymous blackness that stretched in front of her you cant make me daniel looked into the new opening and licked his lips he saw a fantastic opportunity before him this was escapehe could run away with these two knights or whatever they really were he felt the pull in his chestthe tug of adventure of the unknown of dangerand it was exciting to him he turned to freya what other choice do we have he asked her in a meek yet reasonable voice i think we have to go with them daniel coaxed taking her arm and pulling her along through the gap in the wall and into deeper darker tunnels she felt dread from the very first heavy foot that she put forward each step was a step further into darkness and uncertainty each step was a step into fear where are you two from daniel asked are you vikings gods teeth moaned ecgbryt that he would call me such what makes you ask if we are vikings asked swigar well said daniel slowly you speak strangely the weapons your hair you dont seem english we are the very flesh of england ecgbryt exploded the dust of the land is in our blood just as our blood is in its dirt we are its arms its teeth much will have changed since we were put to rest swigar said in a more measured fashion but we were born here and have lived all our lives without stepping a foot off britains shores how come we can understand you freya asked shouldnt you be talking a different type of english and so we are said ecgbryt so how it is one of ealdstans devices there was an arch that you passed under which read i the wordworker of niergeard give to all who pass beneath this arch the gift of free speech if he be truly friendly the enchantment was such that all who pass beneath it would not be hindered in understanding of our words due to ignorance of our language now wait what is this here they had come to a crossroad and stopped the tunnel had narrowed and now split off into three different directions ecgbryt held a hand up to daniel and went to swigar whats wrong daniel asked are you lost not yet be patient please freya crept closer to daniel and whispered to him where are they taking us i dont know i cant remember what he said nithersomething i think nithergard daniel we have to go back im going to tell them that im going back you cant go back theres no way through there anymore i dont care ill stay in the chamber ill stay there until the archway opens again i dont want to be in these tunnels anymore everyone will be worried about us okay when they come back ill talk to them thanks freya said in relief the knights conferred a little longer and then called daniel and freya over this way elingas said swigar not far now i think freyas scared she wants to go back but i told her that this is the only way to go thats true right daniel freya hissed swigar at least acted with more sensitivity he came over and knelt before freya his face sympathetic i am sorry that it must be like this he said but we must continue on thats okay freya said looking into the ancient knights face with its creases and scars she felt her argument start to evaporate but its just that i really dont mind going back and waiting in the room for the doorway to open again you wouldnt have to wait with meim pretty sure i could find my own way back its just that im pretty tired andand a little scaredand i really dont mind waiting id prefer waiting in fact instead of um she trailed off having said everything she wanted to say swigar continued to look at her so she added please i am sorry eling but that is not possible he said standing up we continue our journey in this direction but you said freya said hurrying after him that the wall opened up at a special time when the sun at a certain time swigar agreed with a nod of his head and for a certain person you have already started your journey and you may not stop now you must continue or fail i dont understand said freya the moment at which you found us was no time at all it was what is called a time between times it was the evening the eventimewhen light and dark are equal it is a sacred time it has a strong pull to a certain type of person the place you found us could be called a place between places and you yourself are a person between destinies you have started along a path that you cannot go back on he smiled at her but there will be more paths to choose from and soon perhaps one of those will lead you to the place you seek perhaps somewhere better he said come freya became conscious of her steps her feet falling one in front of the other seemed heavy jarring her when the time place and person are all in an efenheort swigar continued as he walked like a teacher giving a lesson which is a sort of unstable harmonythen fantastic things can happen one must be careful when one finds oneself at a place between places say a beach or a crossroads during either dawn or dusk if his soul is at a spiritual crossroads his mind lost and his body wanderingwhat we might call a person between persons then he may pass through the barriers between worlds as a pillar of smoke passes through a field of mist there are many instances ecgbryt from behind informed them a restless fisherboy with conflicting thoughts in his head and dreams churning in his heart will cast off his bark into the sea before sunrise when the wind sweeps the spray off the waves soon he finds himself far and away on distant adventures with thieves who live beneath the waves pirate kings and magic treasure a young princess not a girl nor yet a queen swigar continued riding at dawn in the forest strays along deer paths and comes to the foot of a hill where the trees thin and finds the entrance to an elfin court she will rule there for many years and then return to our realm still but a young girl though wiser and with many mystical virtues and gifts a wandering rhymer ecgbryt rejoined old and in the twilight of his own life will come to a crossed road and converse with a mysterious gentleman who reveals himself to be the devil they pass the night riddling under the gallows and at dawnat the eventimethe winner will demand a prize from the loser such is the universe swigar resumed a vast multitude of spheres all spinning and dancing in the most intricate and bewildering patterns at the right time and in the right place when the spheres are close enough a man can step from one to the other as easily as crossing a brook so it is vitally important to be aware of those times of evening in your life he said gravely and to consider carefully which path you decide to take for the path will change not just you but your entire world daniels eyes were wide these were thoughts that he had not thought before could never have thought before of course said ecgbryt there are places that are more enchanted than others take the scots land for instance or the norsemens land there are entire seasons of eventimes and complete holdings and folds that belong neither wholly to earth sea air or ice all manner of unnatural and magical acts have flowed from those places like water from a spring and as for the eire folkwell their entire race land and history is ensorcelled from one end of time to the other the scraping of their footsteps continued uninterrupted for a short while daniel threw a look to freya who still appeared miserable well she huffed in a low pained voice someone might have warned us that this sort of thing could happen what said ecgbryt does no one tell stories of such things happening anymore so when we went through the arch daniel said slowly we actually entered another world not exactly no swigar replied the place where we slept was not in one world nor another imagine a tide pool set in the shore of the universe alongside the sea of timean eddy where time spins in upon itself in such a place we remained as we were when we were first laid to rest all who cross from one world to the next must by necessity pass through one of these pools that is why when you hear of people returning from one of those other worlds they have sometimes been gone a day sometimes a hundred years there is little accounting for it but even so there is reason swigars explanation was cut short by a loud piercing scream that rattled down the tunnel knocking against the walls the group halted immediately what was daniels question was smothered out of him by swigars massive hand on his chest as it pushed him against the wall freya was pulled over and pressed next to him here lifiendes take this swigar said pressing his round shield into daniels arms stay behind it daniel hoisted it up in front of freya and himself they poked the top of their heads up from behind the rim their eyes large and fearful whats happening freya asked ecgbryt dropped his torch it still burned casting oversized shadows on the walls of the tunnel he drew his axe from his belt and swung his shield from his back to his arm swigar likewise dropped his torch and raised his spear gripping it with both hands they stood waiting for long seconds that felt like minutes another scream came from behind themhuman but wild savage swigar swung his spear around and faced the sound daniel had read about bansheesspirits that wailed on rooftops when someone was about to die i bet it sounds the same he thought shuddering just then ecgbryt leapt into the darkness his axe glimmering momentarily in the torchlight there was the sound of a scuffle and a shriek and then silence hwt brother is it well swigar asked without turning his head before an answer could come there was a snarl from the tunnel beyond the tall knight and a dark figure sprang into the torchlight it seemed to hang in the air for a long fearfilled moment and then descend it was dark and humanshaped though thin and wiry its arms and elbows were like knotted ropes its legs were thick and shaggy its hands raised long sharp fingers curled into talons its mouth was open in a snarl showing black gums from which sprouted thin needlelike teeth faster than they were able to follow swigar thrust his spear at the terrible shape there was a howl and freya felt a spray of blood on her face the creature dropped clutching the spear now caught in its chest another leapt from behind it and crouched low next to the torch daniel could see its hairless head pale and white face fixed in a snarl of rage a feral hate burning in its eyes it sprung high up in the air just as swigar yanked his spear from the first beast he spun the shaft around in his hands so that the blunt end crashed down on the creatures head swigar drew his short sword from its scabbard and raised it high daniel saw it gleam against the black wall and watched it fall upon the stunned beast hacking at the things shoulder and back neither daniel nor freya could stand to watch and looked away quickly stepping away swigar swung his spear around in his right hand lifting his sword in his left still staring into the blackness that had expelled the creatures he called again ho brother i am here came a reply all are defeated what count have you three and you two only ecgbryt appeared again edging slowly backwards into the torch light sticky blood dripping from the end of his axe onto the pressed dirt floor the two knights stood watching and waiting for a time but there came no more sounds or attackers that appears to be all ecgbryt announced he shouldered his shield and picked up the torch let us see what weve killed shall we daniel handed swigars shield back to him as freya quickly wiped as much of the blood as she could from her face it was thick and brown and sticky she wiped her hands on the cold wall trying not to touch her school clothes they all advanced up the tunnel to where ecgbryts victims lay in a mangled heap using the blade of his axe he nudged the bodies apart from each other yfelgopes ecgbryt said of a kindyet i have never seen a sort as twisted before in the light of the torch they could see the creatures clearer their skin was pale almost milky white dark ghastly blue veins showed through the thin skin all were mostly naked but their groins and upper legs were covered with rough black skins tied together with a tough stringy material that looked like animal hide or maybe dried entrails parts of the creatures torsos were tattooed or stained but not with patterns or designs blotches and irregular stripes were simply dyed a deep solid black or brown freya took a few steps backwards and looked away disgusted did you say ifelgopes daniel asked it is a name we give to all the twisted ones who live in the deep underground swigar said but ive never seen one with such a face the faces were terrifying daniel shivered as he leaned forward for a closer view of one of the corpses its eyes were very far apart and its nose was snubbed its gaping mouth showed small needlelike teeth but theyre human arent they freya asked almost surprised they acted like animals but aye theyre human ecgbryt answered her but nearly as foul as a man can go nearly look at this he tapped his axe against the yfelgops dead hand the thing was wearing some sort of glove made of bone the fingers of which protruded beyond its own the ends had been filed sharp a strange weapon ecgbryt commented aye agreed swigar bring a head he said after a moments pause and a hand he added finally ecgbryt raised a corpse by its thin hair and began chopping at it its unhappy work for my axe thoughand what i wouldnt give for something to wipe my blade against freya stood hunched over suddenly feeling very cold and very very afraid daniel she said in a whisper whats going on daniel watched as the knights heaped the dead bodies on top of each other and cleaned their weapons he could feel his blood pump through his body charged as if every cell was filled with electricity his head spun as a wave of euphoria washed over him he had never felt this way in his real life they had been attacked and the knights because of their weapons and skill had saved them all and come away without a scratch i dont know whats going on he said but im getting one of those swords they walked for some time tense and wary alert to the slightest sound that might give away the presence of something following them swigar walked in front this time his spear at the ready and torch held high ecgbryt walked behind them which freya thought just as well since even thinking of the hideous head and ugly dangling hand tied to ecgbryts belt made her stomach turn over where are we going again daniel asked niergeard ecgbryt answered in a voice strong with pride it is a vast holding beneath the skin of the earth its boundaries are not marked and it sits upon the gates of three hidden worlds it is the grandest of all earthly cities yet known to only a few its dark spires are seen only by those who are great and dream of a larger greatness its an underground kingdom daniel asked with awe it would be the knight behind him replied but there is no king or queen to rule it it is governed by modwyn the fair and overseen by ealdstan the longlived who are they modwyn is niergeards wardable and cunning ealdstan is very old and very wisethe oldest and the wisest in fact by now he would be almost seventeen hundred years old i suppose it was he who laid us to rest as he did the others others daniel repeated his voice rising there are more like you aye there are sleeping knights tucked away up and down the isle a mighty force all lying in wait waiting for what daniel asked ecgbryt considered the question for a moment for the greatest battle in history more than that i cannot say ealdstan may wish to tell you more ealdstan freya repeated the name to herself now said swigar we have told you much about our world and now we would know about yours what is life like on the surface in this century freya glanced at daniel unsure how to respond its hard to say we dont really have anything to compare it to its pretty busy daniel said at least thats what everyone says about it theres a lot of bustle and hurrying everywhere busy is good said ecgbryt idleness is the cause of a great many ills especially in great ones and rulers i dont think thats a problem said freya the government is full of people who work really hard what do you mean by hurrying swigar asked well lots of people are always going places like to work to the stores to buy things to meet people that kind of thing theyre always you know zipping around in cars and buses cars daniel felt awkward hed watched shows on tv and read in stories about people trying to explain modern life to aliens or time travelers or primitive savages or people like that but he never thought that hed actually have to do it himself um cars are like carts that move without horses see you put this sort of fuel into a machine thats inside of it and sort of set fire to itthe fueland that makes it go buses are like that too uh but just bigger he didnt know what the knights would make of this explanation but they seemed to accept it without any further questions he wondered if he should try to explain airplanes as well he decided that might be too complicated so traveling is easier then yes said daniel much easier you can go anywhere in the world that you want to some ways of traveling are so fast that you can get clear to the other side of the world in a day people have been everywhere in the worldincluding the highest mountain and the hottest desert theres nowhere in the world that hasnt been discovered he paused again and wondered if he should tell them about people landing on the moon that was probably too much people can go anywhere swigar said but are they where they want to be i suppose so said freya i think most of them are yes a lot of them arent though daniel said glumly swa swa said swigar so people can move about quickly what else is new freya remembered a class project she had prepared about modern life theres communication too she said we have phones and email on computers which means that you can talk to anyone anywhere in the world anytime you want to that truly is marvelous said swigar and ecgbryt made an admiring noise what do people say when they talk across the world um not much i suppose but it means that you can keep in touch with your loved ones wherever they are you can speak to them even see them at the same time ah what a wonder that is i would dearly love to see such a thing theres information too said freya we have machines so that you can find out about any book ever written or any person living or how things work or what happened in history anything i remember said ecgbryt that king lfred considered knowledge a valuable giftone which he never denied any he thought worthy of it that said i cant recall a time he refused teaching to anyone who asked it from him these days said freya everyone is educated people without any money can know as much as kings and queens pretty much remarkable said ecgbryt yes that was lfreds dream so tell me said swigar with all of these machines and abilitiesare people happy i think so said freya yes happier than if they didnt have all these things are they kind do they treat each other with honour maybe not as much as they could daniel said maybe not much at all actually they still fight then there are wars people are hungry they hate each other so what freya said were things any better in your time whenever that was hmm swigar grunted in faith no they were not there were constant wars and many battles in our lifetime as well as hunger and hate and hardship this only serves to prove what none from my time wanted to admit to themselvesthat men and women of any type of any nation of any advantage at any time will always war with steal from and take advantage of each other no matter what is done to try to help them improve their lives no matter what the advantageseducation riches comfortmen will still tend towards evil do you think theres anything that can stop that daniel asked it seems not said swigar it seems that people carry corruption around inside of them wherever they go you mean we cant do anything i mean that we must do everything but that even that may not be enough they walked in silence for a while contemplating the pessimism in that statement is it much farther daniel asked after a time not at all swigar replied and he was shortly proven to be right within a few hundred paces branching tunnels started to join their own widening their way not dividing it the path they were walking on grew wider and the ceiling gradually rose higher giving them that odd shrinking sensation again the echo of their footsteps gradually faded away and then disappeared altogether and the walls around them grew darker as they became more distant swigar and ecgbryt slowed obviously cautious they moved from the centre of the tunnel to the side walking along the righthand wall eventually they stopped and lowered their torches what is it asked freya suddenly fearful again shh liss ecgbryt breathed motioning them to stop daniel and freya strained to hear coming from the blackness in front of them they heard a faint scrabbling noise as they strained to see what might be making this sound they realised they were staring into nothingness looking up they could just trace the outline of the edge of the natural archway that opened into an unknowably large area cold stale air swept over them in a chilling wave where are we daniel asked in an awed voice at the mouth to one of the entrances to the nierland are we still underground yes it is a large plainmostly flatsupported by large natural pillars now silence as daniel and freya squinted they made out a line of faint paleyellow pinpricks of light running straight across their field of vision the lights were extremely dim and noticeable only if you did not look directly at them they could hear distant voices arguing and shouting daniel and freya felt sick with anticipation now whats going on daniel whispered it was a few moments before swigar answered in a low voice i know not but now we must move in silence and darkness not to be seen or heard to ecgbryt he commanded we will extinguish the torches here broor they did so plunging everything into such an empty darkness that daniel and freya gave quiet gasps then each of them felt one of the knights hands on their back and they were pushed forward for a time daniel and freya felt as if they were walking in nothingness it was completely dark except for the fallen starfield of campfire lights as their eyes adjusted to the almost tangible darkness they started to distinguish the dim shapes of landscape that lay flat on the top of each other broken by pillars of stone rising up on either side reaching up and vanishing towards an unseen ceiling in the distance was a dim glowan arc of faint light like a misty haze freya who had spent some time camping up north knew that this was the light that cities often gave out at nighttime that must be where niergeard was as they went farther they found that the ground wasnt as flat as they had thoughtthere were slight rises and falls and chasms that spewed cold air that had been spanned by bridges stalagmites rose ahead and to either side of them with bases larger than tree trunks and tops that vanished into the darkness the curious scrabbling sound grew louder and the individual noises became separate and more distinct there was a low chattering noise a dusty scraping and some intermittent clanking the pinpricks of light that ran in a line across the landscape gradually grew larger but not much brighter as they approached them freya and daniel soon discovered they were pale campfires burning with a dirty flame the travelers proceeded with slow caution from stalagmite to stalagmite crouching close to one column they saw shapes flicker in front of themfast darting shapes very similar to those that had attacked them in the tunnels rasping voices could just be heard daniel strained his ears but could make out only a few phrases but those phrases didnt make any sense and three more spoon measures make twenty pebbles worth for the final measure explained a grating voice eight twenties make one and sixty from two hundreds and twenty that leaves sixty came a creaky reply this comment was met with a few grunts of annoyance between eight continued the second voice straining slightly thats another seven pebbles worth each at least too mean too mean by far there was a slap of a palm against the bare ground and a chorus of voices rumbling with indignation weigh again weigh again and rats take your toes im so hungry my teeth tingle there were further odd curses and then a rattling clank to my ear and eye whispered ecgbryt withdrawing slightly they are the kith and kind of the creature whose head and hand i have in my belt agreed said swigar and likely as friendly we need a path through i fear they have the whole plain surrounded we could charge them and try to break through the weakest point ecgbryt suggested even without the lifiendes i would fear swigars voice drifted off no he decided we should investigate the neothstream its waters run beneath the city we may gain entry that way ecgbryt was silent for a time and then replied very well be it so this way elingas swigar commanded follow me do not talk the price of an overheard word may be our lives there might be guards or patrols at any point especially as we near the waters head they turned and crept through the dark hunching low to the ground freya wondered what time it was in the real world how long had they been walking was it as dark up there as it was under here she doubted it there were no stars here no street lamps no houselights only the dingy little campfires of those disgusting creatures her breath became short and erratic as her emotions were pulled deeper and deeper into a whirlpool of worry she wasnt afraid of the dark but couldnt help wondering what things there were in the darkness that she couldnt see or wouldnt want to see or couldnt even imagine she felt her eyes grow hot she blinked a couple times and then tears were flowing she kept her sobbing quietsometimes choking back her cries sometimes drawing breath in wide gulps but always being careful to move forward at the same pace after a few minutes the worst had passed and she was wiping her wet cheeks with the palm of her hand and drawing in deep gasps as she swallowed her third deep breath she realised that there was another sound a low subtle sound that she had been hearing for some time without knowing it a sound that had been growing in the distance she concentrated on it trying to tune out the quiet shuffle of their footsteps as they trudged into the darkness she spent a fair amount of time guessing before the answer came to her water there was no liquid hissing or crashing to the sound just the gentle playful gurgle and burble of water sliding along smooth rocks it was such a pleasant beautiful sound she focused her attention on it letting the sound fill her head and trickle down her spine in a pleasant rush that reminded her of hikes in hills of bright skies and fresh air the sound grew they were obviously approaching the source the knights slowed and proceeded more cautiously there was the faint glow of two dim campfires up ahead that illuminated a wet patch of rocks where the trickle of water spilled down over a series of large waterrounded stones to swirl in a deep pool this pool then drained into a wide and slowmoving river daniel and freya stared trying to take in as much as they could in the poor light they thought they could see the forms of two yfelgopes sitting slumped against short pikestaffs in a way that reminded daniel of bored security guards the knights motioned to daniel and freya and the four of them headed along the river and away from the guards there was more activity farther down the river shouts and squabbles drifted towards them above the gurgle of the water the lights grew brighter the campfires closer together foul burnt smells wafted towards them accompanied by ugly cackles and squawks the knights paused and crouched down daniel and freya drew in close to them we must take to the water now swigar told them be carefulthe river is cold and dark and the bed will be slippery a short distance along the river there is a rock shelf that divides the waters it creates an underground stream that feeds many wells of the city if we dive underneath that opening and swim on ahead there will be air on the other side we will be able to climb into the city through the western well do you understand yes said daniel i think so answered freya but how will you do it in your armour the river and its underground passage are shallow enough for ecgbryt and me to stand at any point though you two may have to swim now i shall go first ecgbryt you will come last stay broor is it known what awaits us in the city no but i do not believe it has fallen i wist we would have known if that had come to pass that is much trust without reason an aye to that although i do not think the yfelgop would be entrenched in such a fashion if they had climbed the walls judging from their clustered encampments so close to the wall this seems a siege but what of the beacon ecgbryt asked if all was well we would be seeing by its light right now i know not said swigar a note of anxiety settling into his voice we are bound to investigate the city and discover its fate it is to be hoped that things are not as dark within as without but to find that we must take the river and enter through the western well then be it so ecgbryt returned i trust your advice the water was very cold but quite shallow coming up only to daniels and freyas knees the rocks were large and smooth slowing them down with staggering slips softened splashes and swallowed grunts the stream wove gently in large curves some of which took them much closer to the yfelgop encampments than daniel or freya would have liked most often they heard sounds of squabbling and snatches of arguments but around one fire the ugly creatures were engaged in chanting a song that the knights later told them was a rune rhymea series of blunt coarse verses describing the yfelgopes alphabet and system of numbering they beat the dirt with dull thuds and recited the words in a ragged chorus fyr is first it burns it thirsts it feasts on flesh and fallen foes urth is dirt the second house we dig the dead decayed to dust thorn is third it cuts it carves a cold and cruel crown for kings ald is age it wastes it wanes want walks forth when time wreaks wreck rech is smoke the smog that smothers the fifth sense smell it chokes it chars claw is sixth it snicks it snatches when sharp it shivs and dull it catches the verses went on chilling daniels and freyas hearts just as the icy water chilled their feet after a time daniels legs started to go numb it was an unpleasant feeling the water deepened until he was wading in it up to his waist as he struggled to keep up daniel could make out the shape of swigar striding confidently ahead of him then startlingly the knight bobbed swiftly downwards the water now up to the large knights torso daniel braced himself for what was to come he made his way cautiously to where swigar had sunk farther in and put a twitching foot forward he suddenly felt himself sinking gasping as the water enveloped him he sank farther and farther down panicking he thrashed his arms if mere exertion and prayer could have saved him from going farther under then he would have stopped right there but he didnt with a terrified glub his head slipped under the surface of the water he strained his head upwards as his hands tore away at the ice water after an age dry warmth finally bathed his face and he sucked in a huge gasp of air quietly quietly cautioned ecgbryt his mouth pressed close to daniels ear place your feet on the ground daniel stretched his legs underneath him as the knight lowered him back into the water ii cant feel the bottom his voice was an urgent whimper its too deep it is not be calm put your legs down straight unbend your back daniel found this hard since the chill had started making him shiver uncontrollably his feet kicked in vain for a time and then struck against something he pointed his toes and found that solid ground was in fact beneath him he put his feet down and found that the water only just covered his shoulders iii cant he stammered worry not said the even voice of ecgbryt i am here beside you daniel gulped and started to move forward again swigar stood ahead a little distance stopped apparently waiting freya was swimming quietly and confidently a short distance off to his right it was slow hard work for daniel who was finding trying to stay afloat in his clothes almost impossible he paddled along as best as he could but moved faster with his toes fumbling along the rocky bed swigar up ahead motioned to them he pointed to the spot where he was standing and ducked under the water he didnt come up daniel approached the area where swigar had disappeared ecgbryt behind him freya was paddling around the area she went down once and bobbed back up again took a very deep breath went back down and didnt come up again daniel could feel with his feet where the ground fell sharply away he stopped paralysed trying to find enough breath and courage to move forward it is well said a voice behind him swim as you can and push yourself along the rocks its not far daniel swallowed and took a deep breath he bobbed up and down in the water and then plunged his head under he tried to pull himself forward and felt a strong hand on his back giving him a push that sent him surging forward faster than he liked he put his hands out in front of him and felt them scrape hard on the floor of the underwater stream the pain made his face clench he wanted to let out a scream but didnt dare open his mouth suddenly there wasnt enough air in his lungs he made a mistakethis was wrong he didnt have enough air should he go back or was he already there he tilted his body upwards thinking or hoping he must be there but banged his head against a rocky ceiling instead he saw red and white lights before his closed eyes throwing his hands outwards he tried to push claw or scrape himself along he gained a little momentum but not a lot he kicked his feet but they felt heavy and slow in his waterfilled shoes his lungs burned this must be what dying is like he thought he felt a large hand grab his back and he was once again lifted out of the water his breath exploded outwards he sucked air deep into his lungs marveling at its taste and warmth he had survived it is done lad it was swigar this time you made it stand daniel put his legs down the water was shallower here but moved much faster he stood coughing and sputtering in the absolute darkness freya he said when he found his breath yes came a reply in what to him seemed a very calm and collected voice though shivering slightly with cold im here are you okay i think so he said grinning i wish i had tried harder in swimming class ecgbryt surfaced behind them his metal armour jangling as he struggled for a footing on the wet rocks it gets the blood flowing he said laughing does a good dip like that ill say daniel said let us press onwards swigar said freya hold on to my shoulder daniel take ecgbryts we will lead you with daniel and freya shivering uncontrollably the four moved through the neartotal darkness time had become abstract since entering the tunnels and now didnt seem to touch them at all they had just begun to think they would wander around in the dark forever when a quivering outline could be made out on the surface of the water up ahead it is here said swigar he stepped beneath a dim halo of light that fell from the wells shaft above them a soft luminescence cascaded down his face and shoulders throwing his highbrowed features into sharp relief it was the first clear image that daniel and freya had seen for some time and it stung their eyes there are rungs for climbing set into the stone he explained i will lift you up as high as i may then follow behind a warm fire and dry dress will be waiting for you think on that daniel you come first this time swigar knelt allowing daniel to put one foot on his squared upper leg reaching up he found he could touch the bottom rung swigar made a cradle out of his hands and daniel putting his other foot inside it found himself launched up into the round rocky hole with a cry of surprise he threw his arms out bracing himself along the sides of the well to keep from falling back down just above his right hand was a rung and he grabbed it below that was another which he managed to get his foot on alright he called down start climbing came the reply im sending up freya behind you with water cascading off of his drenched clothes daniel started to haul himself up relishing the idea of putting those dark and extremely wet caverns and creatures behind him and wondering what was ahead he kept his head up and eyes fixed on the little circle of light still far above him he started climbing faster even though his arms and legs were very tired and unbelievably heavy eventually he came to the end of the rungs he paused before putting his head through the opening then placing his hands on the rim of the well he pushed himself forward and tumbled up and out of the darkness he slid off and onto a stonepaved floor exhausted he lifted his head looked around slowly and gaped at what he saw a huge tree towered above daniel stretching up into the darkness it was unlike any tree that hed ever seen before it was carved out of a pale almost golden stone and set tight against two trees exactly like itand more after each of those and on and on into the distance their branches interlaced with each other in the most elaborate and bewildering patterns the leaves were painted green and traced with something metallic that glimmered like gold long garlands of ivy were chiseled into the trunks of the treesall of them twirling around in the same direction daniel became completely lost in the design of the branches which he now saw contained small sculptures of birds animals and insects he walked slowly up to the tree clothes still dripping and reached out his hand to touch a leaf half expecting it to be soft and thin it was rigid and cold wow he said in awe he turned around to help freya and took a moment to examine the wellthe western well it was carved out of the same stone as the wall but in a much different style swirling shapes rose up from the ground in a short pillar of water and continued seamlessly into a large iron frame which rose above the wells rim and supported a pulley mechanism there was a wet slopping noise from inside the well and freya appeared from the darkness he helped her up with an effort and she toppled onto the stone pavement behind him he couldnt stop himself from grinning as she did a double take at the wall of stone trees can you believe this he asked her in amazement an underground city i wasnt sure i believed it but its here look at this wall it just goes on and on and these just look buildings rose up on the other side of them about ten storeys high carved out of the stone with strips of intricate tracery around the doors windows and roof in the spaces between daniel and freya could glimpse more buildingssome grander some smaller but all of them displaying a wealth of fascinating details more of the silver lanterns could be seen being used as streetlamps and houselights a hand tugged daniels elbow freya gripped his arm and pointed a shaky finger approaching them was a scowling man holding a long glistening sword there was a scraping sound behind them and they turned to find themselves surrounded by three more men drawing similar weapons all four faces were pale and almost deathly grey features like eyebrows noses and chins all blended into the pallid skin making the faces look oddly similar what should we do freya whispered just wait and see what they say dont worry i wont let them hurt you one of the men opened his mouth to speak when the grunting and muttering of ecgbryt was heard behind them he climbed out of the well and shook the water from his wet clothing swigar came close after the two knights glared at the circle of guards around daniel and freya we are ecgbryt and swigar of oxenaforde with two lifiendes we seek ealdstan the wise is there one who will take us to the langtorr one of the guards standing around daniel and freya acknowledged the knights request with a nod well met he said in a soft but gruff voice i am breca i will take you there he turned and led them away through an arched passageway between two buildings and out into a wide street freyas and daniels heads swiveled in every direction as they walked down the streets of the underground city trying to take in as many of the amazing details as possible ecgbryt watched them and smiled welcome to niergeard young lifiendes he said proudly perhaps the greatest of the hidden wonders of the world i have heard of faroff kings who spoke in tongues now dead living in sandy kingdoms who have built strange and enormous structures to their own memory i have heard tell of elfin palaces in twilight kingdoms whose citizens have harnessed the power of the moon just as the laedenware have tamed the rivers to their towns purposes there are people on the far side of this strange world who live in rooms of parchment wear gossamer robes and kneel to eat there are dark men who live in forests with trees so vast and large that the sky is never seen but were all of these faroff brothers and sisters to arrive here in this hallowed place they would think their homes small and their birthplaces of little consequence to the might and glory of niergeard the slaeperaburgh see that building there ecgbryt continued passionately carved out of the solid rock no stonejoiner ever found a days work at that place and see there that tall walkway which stretches near across the city the work of twice twenty years worth of solid labora hundred men every day did you hear that freya daniel said leaning towards her but not taking his eyes off the spectacle of a thin stone bridge that arced clear across the city its absolutely amazing the structures were truly incredible although they had apparently needed repairs over the centuries new stone looked incongruous against that much older the streets and stairways were bowed and worn away drooping in the centre like warm butter here and there in the doorways and windows freya could see people watching themtheir faces pale and drab living underground for hundreds and hundreds of years their skin had turned almost grey and their clothing was faded and worn why does everyone look so tired and sad freya asked is that it is that the langtorr daniel exclaimed the unfamiliar word clinging to his tongue he pointed to a massive pillar that rose before them carved out of one of the enormous natural supports to the underground plain only the lower part of the tower could be seen in the light of the citys flickering torches but its top must have reached to the roof of the underground land the light of flickering torches could be seen through chiseled windows rising above the city hanging in the air like a giant column of rectangular stars yes said ecgbryt also called the tall tower it is the heart of niergeard designed firstly to hold the people of niergeard should the town be invaded have they ever had to use it freya asked to my knowledge no the walls have always been sufficient to repel attackers but why is all of this here why have an underground city niergeard exists to provide service to all the knights and warriors who sleep in these isles what do you mean there are times when tunnels need to be strengthened or closed or better hidden when armour and arms must be polished horses shod and so on a myriad of responsibilities those in niergeard have dedicated their lives to these small acts that is their sacrifice how many sleeping knights are there very many i do not know the number for many more would have been laid down since we went to sleep daniel and freya the knights and their escort walked a path into the middle of the city gradually approaching the tall tower after passing through a particularly narrow alley they entered a large open plaza ahead of them they could see the base of the langtorr as well as the entrance across a plain smooth floor paved mostly with white marble paths of red and green marble tracing a complicated seamless pattern that wove dizzyingly in and out of itself daniel tried to follow it but had to look up as he started to sway and lose his balance staggering he laughed and quickened his step to join the others freya noticed one building near the langtorra squat circular building about twelve feet high it was not ornately carved or adorned in any way its rock was roughly hewn and reinforced with iron bracers atop it stood five stout simple columns supporting a flat stone roof what is that freya asked squinting at a gleaming line of gold whats inside it caged in by the columns was one of the weirdest and most haunting objects that either daniel or freya had ever seen supported by a chain dangling from the roof and lit from underneath it looked like some sort of ornate golden horn it started at about the width of an arm at the bottom but the barrel gradually widened at the top where it ended in an odd animalhead shape it had large completely circular eyes and a blunt sharptoothed snout that opened up wide as if the thing were shouting swigar saw daniel and freya staring at the object and gave a small smile it is the great carnyx elingas he said the trumpet that will wake all the knights and summon them to battle it is the most guarded and valued item in niergeardperhaps in all of the isle they walked slowly past the carnyx and came at last to the large ornate doorway of the langtorr a huge stairway made of curved steps proceeded from the entrance every step was lit by a silver lantern that illumined the path to a thick archway containing many smaller arches each one nestled inside the other bearing wonderful designs the farthest inside the arch bore an interlocking zigzag pattern the next featured a row of stylised bird heads the next a row of animals then a row of warriors standing guard and finally on the outside arch a row of mythical beasts two alcoves were tucked into the massive pillars on either side of the doorway here stood two guards with hair so white it almost glowed and pulled hard along their scalps to fall in long thick braids which were bound with gold circlets to their shoulders full beards jutted out from their chins and forked in the middle to reveal bands of twisted gold around their necks they wore no armour but their broad chests and massive arms had a heavy immovable firmness here and there on the chest arms and legs small delicate whorled patterns were traced in faint blue dye this together with their blanched skin made freya believe unquestioningly that these guards were exquisite carvingsso she couldnt help gasping when they started to move the palefaced escorts of the party marched wordlessly up to the two ghastly guards low unfamiliar words were uttered and the stony guards silently moved to one side allowing the company to pass daniel and freya mounted the steps behind the knights feeling very insignificant amongst all the ancient grandeur passing under the magnificent archway daniel stared awestruck at the huge metal doors that stood open against the walls of the inner forecourt they seemed to be made of large plates of sheet metal decorated with climbing wroughtiron swirls and whorls all layered on top of each other giving the effect of a massive wall of fire frozen in metal beyond the doors was a narrow greeting chamber there was a red woven rug on the floor a gleaming chandelier made from the silver lanterns and several tall dark tapestries on the walls though they were dark with age freya could just make out the positions of a few of the larger figures one of them climbing a rock face one of them in a boat pitched at a dramatic angle the party passed through this room and strode towards a stairway that flung two flights of stairs out and up around the circumference of the inner wall daniel and freya craned their necks to try to see the ceiling but the hollow core of langtorr ran straight up through the centre the stairs rose with it spiraling up and up like two paper ribbons in a tornado as they marveled at the everascending steps they became aware of someone walking down them a tall slender willowy woman so graceful she seemed to drift on a cushion of air she wore a long brightgreen dress under a heavier darkgreen robe edged with silver thread the colours of her clothes reminded freya of a tree budding in the spring she looked neither old nor young her hair was auburn with dark streaks of rich brown and was swept back secured at the back of her head with pins of gold then left to fall about her neck and shoulders silver gleamed at her neck and waist she wore a belt of finely polished silver discs and a weblike necklace made from many twining strands of the same metal her face was pale but her lips were a deep red which seemed darker against the alabaster whiteness of her skin her eyes were large and sad looking as if remembering a sorrow from a distant time she paused a few steps from the bottom of the staircase and crossed her arms tucking her hands into her sleeves swigar and ecgbryt knelt in front of her daniel and freya unsure what to do stood behind the knights their hearts pounding in anticipation overwhelmed with awe daniel thought her face the most beautiful he had ever seenit filled his mind and made him forget for a few seconds all the things he had gone through to get here freyas awe was sharp and felt like a cold wind blowing through her for some reason the womans grandeur and selfpossession made her afraid greetings modwyn richeweard said swigar well betide you niercwen said ecgbryt humbly the stately lady in green curtsied you are welcome in niergeard swigar and ecgbryt noble knights both rise a servant woman in a velvet dress appeared from a doorway beneath one of the stairs approached her mistress and handed her a silver pitcher and a small cupped dish stepping forward modwyn poured some golden liquid into the bowl and handed it to swigar he raised it to his lips and drained it while looking modwyn in the eye taking the bowl from him she refilled it and gave it to ecgbryt he likewise emptied it and handed it back modwyns eyes then flitted to daniel and freya as the two knights rose to their feet her expression remained stern and serious but her eyes seemed to grow more intense and lively my lady i bring before you daniel tully and freya reynolds two lifiendes who have awoken us we have escorted them here to beg your protection and petition your counsel i accept their charge modwyn said in a low emotionless voice daniel and freya she continued turning her eyes to them do you accept my hospitality daniel and freya did not speak for some reason everything felt as if it was happening a long way away and to someone else they looked to the knights children this is modwyn the ward and protectress of niergeard it is her constant and capable hand that ensures the safe and easy governance of this land she is asking if you wish to have her protection daniel looked back to modwyn and managed to force out yes please freya looked to modwyn and blurted desperately we need to go home now please modwyn regarded freya in time she said so softly that they were not sure she had said it at all i welcome you modwyn said stepping past the two knights to stand before them our doors are open and our fires high find rest and safety here she poured another bowl of drink and offered it to daniel he took it uncertainly and sniffed it he was met with a sweet smell and tingling sensation in his nose it is well swigar assured him drink it was sweet like honey slightly fizzy and had a spicy flavor which pricked at his throat and excited his stomach there was also something in it that warmed daniel and made him shiver slightly he returned the bowl to modwyn and she filled it again and gave it to freya looking into the bowl freya saw the shimmering dance of refracted golden light which showed a deep golden hue the scent made freyas nose tingle and warmed her face she stifled a sneeze you are both wet and chilled modwyn said reclaiming the bowl please dry yourselves and take some rest we will talk when you have taken some sleep at the mention of the word sleep freya felt herself becoming very drowsy if you please miss she said hesitantly we would like to go home i understand modwyn said smiling a thin smile that failed to light her dark eyes but you have come very far and will have farther to return that will be for ealdstan to decide for now it would give me great pleasure to provide some food dry clothes and a bed for you both will you accept these offerings freya did not answer only nodded okay daniel said his head starting to swim and his eyelids becoming extremely heavy modwyn inclined her head i am glad two servants appeared from behind daniel and freya entering so quietly that they were unnoticed they were dressed almost to the knees in darkgreen shirts bound around the waist with bronze belts that also held up loose lightgreen leggings both had lightbrown hair and broad faces this is cnafa and cnapa modwyn said they will fetch and provide you with everything you might require now they will show you to your rooms will swigar and ecgbryt be here when we wake up daniel asked yes assuredly answered modwyn what about ealdstan freya asked will we see him the two knights smiled encouragingly go take your rest said swigar we will meet again once you have been refreshed daniel and freya followed cnafa and cnapa very sleepily up one of the spiral staircases below them they watched modwyn gesture to swigar and ecgbryt and lead them off through a towering doorway beneath the opposite set of stairs they were led up to the second level and down a hallway that ran along the tower wall the high windows gave them a view of the towers courtyard and the city of niergeard this will be your room young master either cnafa or cnapa said to daniel opening a large wooden door to a spacious bedroom and this said the other servant walking one door farther down the hallway will be your room young mistress you will find dry clothes and linens on the table as well as clean water in the jug daniels servant informed him may your sleep be guided your body rested your mind restored and your soul renewed daniel and freya said their thanks and before stepping into their rooms glanced at each other from down the hall scared mouthed freya me too daniel replied as the two servants pushed them each into their rooms chapter five a leaf from another forest now freya trudged through the wet streets walking so fast that her shins hurt as she approached st michael and all angels she saw daniel looking agitated leave the church and run down the path he looked up recognised her and raised his armin warning he opened his mouth as if to shout and at the same time put a hand on the low wooden gate that led out into the street he pushed it open and with his foot raised to take a step forward seemed to stumble and disappeared into thin air freya yelped and jumped backwards danger was the only thought in her mind she wanted to run but didnt know where daniel had been taken from the open air underneath the rickety wooden arch of the lychgateshe didnt think that was possible what was to say that she wouldnt be as well she became paralysed any step in any direction could be a step across a threshold that might send her into peril in full panic freyas mind closed up and terror filled her she fell into a crouch and buried her head in her arms she was aware of a sound growing around her which built and trickled down her spine it was laughter raising her head she found herself looking up at the vicious figures of two yfelgopes their lips curled in a sneer around their needlelike teeth freya now more terrified than ever flinched instinctively away from them sprawling on the pavement she closed her eyes and covered her face back she heard someone shout back you devils there were the sounds of a scuffle a roar of pain and then nothing freya felt a hand on her shoulder and her heart chilled freya is that you she fought to control her breathing and opened her eyes it was professor stowe freya good heavens are you mixed up in this she opened her mouth and tried to speak youre in bad shape professor stowe said come with me stand close she realised it was raining stowe shook out an umbrella and held it above her clinging to his arm she huddled close and they walked away from the church he led her back down banbury road to his rooms in norham gardens were not staying here he said i just need to check on something first here take this and dry yourself off he handed freya a towel and left the hallway freya pushed the towel through her hairwhen had it become wetand looked around the small hallway there was an engraving on the wall behind the door of a large tree intricately detailed its smallest leaves described it spread its branches into the heavens as if it were holding the sky in place or pushing it away from the ground professor stowe came back and led her out of the room and down the staircase but instead of leaving through the front door they descended another short set of stairs and exited through a back door this placed them in a narrow overgrown garden where are we going freya asked to a special placethe old observatory i stay in this house by design not chance this house contains one of only a few routes into a forgotten building which is now an important meeting place for an important group of individuals ii just want to go back home freya said and meant it she wanted nothing more than to crawl into her own bed and not to come out again ever im afraid its not as simple as that why like your friend daniel you are just on the cusp of falling out of this world i tried to reach him but i was too late there are forces that want to push you out of this world have you ever experienced anything like that before he shot her a sideways look freya kept her eyes on the pavement in front of her freya im talking about the feeling that you may have fallen through into another world she wanted to tell himhad wanted to tell someone for so long but all this time shed stayed silent she couldnt i suspected as much please do come with me we can help you freya swallowed and ducked through the wild foliage that grew in their path they came to a thin wooden door warped with age which hung in a narrow gap between two crumbling brick walls stowe took a key from his pocket and unlocked a padlock that hung from a shiny latch then he went through freya paused instinctively took a breath and moved through the doorwaythen back out again and in and out several more times after that this didnt make her feel much more comfortable in the circumstances but it didnt make her feel worse she found herself in a small courtyard where tall hedges blocked nearly everything out of sight except for a small swatch of the sky above them professor stowe had disappeared here wefreya his voice called his stepped back into view from between two of the hedges its just over here she followed him down a redbricked path that was almost completely grown over with moss and ivy and then was confronted by a squat door stained black set into a low arch professor stowe searched his pockets for a dead bolt key and unlocked it he stepped through and waited for freya freya stood rooted to the spot she fought to keep the flood of panic from overwhelming her again freya its okay professor stowe said holding out his hand come on through with a visible effort freya lifted her leaden feet and stepped through the doorway stowe was just about to close the door behind her when she hissed wait and tugged at his sleeve this was too important she felt to be embarrassed about she ducked out of the doorway looked up at the sky and crossed back in she repeated this three more times and stood uncertainly inside the doorway okay she said are you alright stowe asked her less concerned than amused yes freya replied feeling calmer good come on upstairs then they walked down a short hallway with a claustrophobically low ceiling and came to a cold square room that contained an iron spiral staircase freya felt a chill and looked upthe room rose several stories and finished in darkness there were narrow dirty windows in the walls that let in the last light of the evening not far now professor stowe said mounting the staircase with freya behind him this is the old observatory yes this is a private place that is the university owns it but id think the administrators have completely forgotten about its existence it was appropriated many years ago by people of our cause as a secret meeting room where we could discuss action against those who wish to invade this sphere freyas hand tightened on the rail and she stopped i cant do this she said i wont be of any help im sorry you dont want me professor stowe turned and said in a low comforting voice dont worryits unlikely that you will be asked to join our group i only asked you here so that you can further help us with what we knowperhaps fill in some blanksand most of all to keep you safe we can keep you safe freya started up the stairs again reluctantly they rose three storeys to a door that stood open letting out a warm electricyellow glow stepping through the doorway freya was met with a warm blast of air and the rich heady aroma of something burning in a fireplace from the front hall she could hear a soft susurrus of people talking in the front room there is a meeting already in progress so come through here stowe said and led freya into the kitchen put the kettle on while i tell them who you are i shall return shortly stowe said leaving freya filled the kettle at the sink and then replaced it in its holder and turned it on the front room adjoining the kitchen was silent from where she stood she couldnt see into it and didnt want to she was already feeling very selfconscious when the kettle boiled she filled the mug and stirred it with a teaspoon from the dish drainer there was a small refrigerator below the counter and she opened it to find that it contained a single bottle of milk in an oldfashioned glass bottle she sniffed itit seemed fineand poured a little into her tea professor stowe returned are you ready to meet the society youre a society yesthe society of concerned individuals its a deliberately vague and eccentric title this way if you will steeling herself freya followed stowe and stepped into a large octagonal drawing room it was fairly well furnisheda large turkish rug lay on the floor and thick drapes hung on the windows where there werent windows on the walls there were framed prints on one side of the room there was a wide shallow fireplace that was cheerfully burning coal and warming the room nicely there was a circle of mismatched armchairs clustered around a low coffee table four of the chairs were occupied by three men and one woman who stared intently at freya as she entered she smiled sheepishly please take a seat professor stowe said indicating the one closest to freya she lowered herself into it and huddled over her mug of tea let me make introductions first of all said stowe settling into his own chair the gentleman on my right he said indicating an elderly gent in his seventies who wore a full head of white hair and a tweed suit is first lieutenant gerrard cross retired a former lecturer in british mythologyand a specialist in scottish ballads sitting next to him is ms leigh sinton a thin darkhaired woman in her forties wearing a darkgreen jumper gave a small wave and then very primly and unnecessarily straightened her tan skirt shes something of an allrounder with an enthusiasm for archaeology and is a tireless mountain trekker next is mr wood though im sure that hell insist that you call him brent sright grunted a wellbuilt heavyset man in a dark jacket and grey waistcoat his face was stern and his lips gave the impression of being buttoned in the centre but his cheeks glowed attractively theres nobody who knows the university like him hes currently a porter at jesus college and finally there is the reverend borough he is fully ordained but attached to the collegenot the church a man in his late thirties nearly bald with traces of red hair above his ears gave an awkward bow to freya peter please and finally theres me your good professor he gave her a warm smile although while you are here you may address me as felix everyone was looking at her expectantly so freya gave a small wave and introduced herself freya reynolds hi freya is a childhood friend of daniel tully the boy i was following and who i regret to inform you now has been taken the room reacted to this news in dismay the elderly mr cross pursed his lips and clucked his tongue ms sinton wrung her hands and exclaimed oh dear brent wood slowly shook his head side to side and the reverend closed his eyes and soundlessly moved his lips in fact she was with him when it happened continued stowe i say she was with him though it would be more accurate to say that she was near him he was coming to see her when he stepped across a lychgate and just vanished do i have that right this last sentence was directed at freya she nodded in agreement ms sinton leaned forward this is no doubt cause for concern and felix will give us specific details laterbut he told us just now that he believed you had been for want of a better word taken when you were younger is this true freyas eyes dropped to her tea and looked into the steam swirling up from it then she started to retell in a halting voice the lies and halftruths that she had told the police and all the psychiatrists over the years she made sure to include all of the rehearsed halts pauses and stutters she had tailored into it when we were younger she said daniel and i we found a tunnel that we explored when we tried to leave we couldnt find our way out again we were missing for almost a month we wandered through tunnels underground we licked water that dripped from rocks we ate insects sometimes and then we were found up north somewhere i dont remember where the group looked at her with blank faces and thats it freya said youll forgive me my dear said the stout porter wood but i believe that is far from it as you say freya was shocked by this outright attack she automatically started replaying another side of the story she usually held in reserve to make people think that they had earned her trust there were people i think and they helped us maybe butbut i dont remember much about them and i say it was nothing of the sort please brent said rev borough dont antagonize the girl im sure i would not wish to open up to a group of strangers about events that most would think me mad for relating she simply doesnt know to trust us yet perhaps we should let her rest and she can explain more when shes recovered thank you freya said spying an out im justtheres a lot thats happened recently with daniel and i dont think i can talk about it yet please tell me what do youi mean the societydo lt cross said professor stowe rising perhaps youd like to give our guest a shortvery short mindaccount of our history i have a matter i must attend to excuse me he left the room well lt cross began the society was formed in april of when elsie wright and frances mitchell began meeting regularly with sir wilfred rewlbury the head of the royal society of biology and in may of that year nils ogred a swiss botanist initially they met in a small tearoom in bradford which was convenient for charting incidents in the area they were over time joined by robert trebor the historian and lecturer and arthur rutherford lord sansweete in august of nils ogred moved to holland and the group relocated meeting in the chapter house of westbury cathedral they were joined by rodney woodrue and nassar rassan in october after lord sansweete left in june of in september the group was on hiatus following sir rewlburys sons disappearance once that situation was resolved they started meeting again but this time in the bury st edmunds town hall they were joined by gentleman scientist rian buford clark sassoon and lady gail nyman it was at this time that rifts began to form and in july the group first split with wright woodrue rassan and sassoon meeting on thursdays of alternating weeks and the rest meeting from november of that year on the first and third mondays of every week at the private library of joseph freya wasnt following any of this she was so desperately tired that for a few moments she couldnt decide if it was more polite to excuse herself or just fall quietly asleep im sorry im not reallyi think it would be best if i left she blurted but made no effort to move or even lift her head wimbourne twentyeighth earl of winton the following year february to be specific was when mitchells faction began their private royal presentations at that time before george v he allowed mitchells group use of the royal gallerys eastern rooms which in march of was abandoned for the gallery room of the royal gardens eastern offices meanwhile the wright society freya thought that she protested once more at this point but she didnt have time to recall what shed said because the next instant she was asleep the trip up to dunbeath the largest village next to morven took just a couple hours and was a scenic costal drive as he came closer to morven the sky became overcast threatening rain the clouds were so dark and deepalmost purple in factthat one could almost think it was starting to be evening alex looked at the dashboard clock it read am instead of finding a place in the village to park he turned inland and looked for the farm farmers were more tied into the area not just in terms of community but of the land as well he came across a group of small buildings near a sign that read bainabruich he pulled the land rover up a dirt driveway killed the ignition and let himself in through a cattle gate after knocking and receiving no reply at the front door he circled around the house to the large open barn through the doors in the back he could see a tractor moving across one of the fields he spotted the path to the field and started along it when the man in the tractor saw him he turned off his engine and climbed out of the cab hello alex said reaching into his pocket and pulling out a wallet that he had stuffed his police badge into my name is alex simpson im with the northern constabulary the truth i work in the special crimes unit the lie oh aye the farmer said cautiously reaching into his jacket pocket for a tobacco pouch and a packet of rizlas can i ask your name sir rab duthie he stuck out his hand alex shook it my department deals with crime patterns by location and sociological region i wonder if you wouldnt mind answering a question or two about the area the farmer licked his cigarette paper and nodded grand alex said pulling out his notebook more to stall for time than anything else all that nonsense about worming your way into the affections of the local folk by handing out cigarettes and making sly comments was pure fantasysomething just to keep the mystery serials on tv moving along the farmers hed grown up around werent that gormless he was going to have to blag his way through and hope that his officiousness carried him to where he needed to be there have been reports of animals missing in the area anything of your own gone walkabouts duthie lit his rollup and took a puff squinting as he thought nothing missing as such but there have been some breakages vandalism ye ken alex scribbled in his notebook where did this occur east fold he said gesturing hedge been flattened the hedge aye flattened right down to the ground torn up places but mostlyhe made a squashing motion with his palmshad to put up some planks to stop the sheep all from wandering awa thats odd could we go an have a look alex asked looking out across the field sure nae problem hop on rab duthie started up the tractor and they rolled off alex perched on the footstep holding on to the cab after some maneuvering around dirt tracks and muddy paths they came to a long thick hedge that must have been alex judged at least a hundred years old it was only about five feet high but over four feet wide the tractor shuddered to a stop and alex hopped down ye can see it there said duthie climbing down and discarding his cigarette and pointing to a gap in the hedge i no ken how it happened too narrow for any car or tractorand ive seen both get stuck trying to travel through thinnerin addition to there bein no tracks no animal i know of would have the power tae do it except an elephant mebbe alex poked around a little but found nothing peculiar you really have no idea what did this the farmer looked at him for a second and then shrugged and shook his head he stuck his hands in his pockets which meant that he did have some idea but that he wasnt willing to share it anything else odd in the area weel theres been carjackings joyriding and the like its been awhile since weve had that up here rab duthie said looking off into the distance his voice getting high stressed its like a wee crime wave up here been thievings fights most nights down at the pubs even the quiet ones people are fashedright desperate ye ken spirits are low weve had a bad seasonnae enough rain or sunlight everything ye put in the ground comes up weak and yellow if at all and that gets ye doon natural but folks took it hard this year some farmers hae kilt themselves and done tried kilt themselves children children done kilt themselves teenagers with their lives ahead of them duthie paused and spat on the ground twice his voice was getting low and raw now alex said nothing their lives ahead of them and they can no see a way forard more afeared of life than they are of death every one of them is a blow even the ones that pull through it gets to you it mounts up in your soul and you find yourself looking at a bottle of pills or a rafter in the barn and you think weel weel mebbe duthie cleared his throat noisily and spat again he didnt look like he felt like saying any more after that well alex said eventually it seems to me as if you have more problems than just a gap in your hedge duthie forced a laugh what do you think is causing it alex asked the farmer turned his head crime suicide depression violence drunkenness vandalism and this gap in your hedge to you they all seem connected whats causing these things duthie turned to stare alex straight in the eyes his sturdy weathered frame swayed slightly in the brisk morning air aye i have a ken of whats causin thisthis atmosphere of hate and fear and you would nae believe me duthie shouted almost angry in his desperation try me the deil duthie seemed shocked to hear himself say the words out loud he stood trembling the devil aye now were getting somewhere alex said grinning duthie turned to look at alex out of the corner of his eye you dont think im crazy not at all alex said i think youre clever and brave to say that duthie nearly broke down completely his eyes became watery and he had to look away my wifeshe dusnae get up most days says she can feel the presence of evil herelike a giant hand thats pushing everyone doon who hereaboutsor in the village perhapswould i go to find out more about this alex asked a town official mayor priest wise old woman duthie pushed at his cheekbones with his palms rector he said clearing his throat rector maccanish hes your man where will i find him alex asked down the kirk ill tak ye to him duthie said climbing into the tractor once more if it is the deil he said before he started the engine is there anythin a man can do about it of course there is alex answered thats why im here oh no not again sitting upright daniel looked around everything was different he was now in a meadow covered with lush green grass that stretched out vast flat and empty in all directions ahead of him just visible on the flat horizon was a thick green line between the sky and the plain a forest he twisted around behind him the ground seemed to slope up slowly over the miles and far far into the distance rose an enormous mountain it was so far away that it was actually rather hard to seeit blended in almost perfectly with the sky so that only the edges and top could be traced it rose to a single peak and its sides flowed down smooth and straight it was as if someone had poured an enormous pile of sugar out onto the landscape but that was itthere was nothing else around him not a hill not a bush not a tree stump the sun in the sky above him seemed massive and that along with the mountain gave him the feeling that he was now inside of a larger world than the one he had been in just a few moments ago this thoughtthat he was in a different worlda different planetmade his stomach lurch he stood and scanned the horizon looking for any detail at all but there were just those few elements the plain the forest the mountain the sky and the sun and each of these was so absurdly simple so iconic as if a child had drawn them he stopped turning and listened there was the sound of a gentle wind blowing past his ears but nothing more hello he asked out loud there was only silence well there was no point in staying in one place he had two options nowthe mountain or the forest he chose the forest at the very least there would be some sort of basic shelter against the sky and perhaps food he started walking after more than an hour of walking the forest didnt seem any closer nor the mountain any farther looking to the sky he saw that the sun had moved but not by much not as much as should have living on the street had given him a welltuned sense of time of day this was undoubtedly a different world he had suspected this from the start from a dozen almost indefinable differences in the air horizon gravity the distance he was able to seeall these things differences in constants he had known from birth added up to a general feeling of unfamiliarity with what was around him where was he and why was he alone oddly he didnt feel hungry or tiredwell no more hungry or tired than he did when he came here it was something in the air that felt nourishingor maybe sustaining was the correct word there was a fairly stiff wind but he felt warm he had taken off his heavy jacket for the first time in months then he unslung his sword from his shoulder and fitted it around his waist he didnt feel the need to hide it now in fact it was probably better that anyone he came across did see it perhaps it was only his sense of time that was distorted and not the worlds he counted silently in his head and then out loud he measured that against the steps he was taking and the progress that he didnt seem to be making everything he was doing seemed to be normal and easiest explained by the fact that he was somewhere very vast and where was that another planet another dimension could he be in his own minda hallucination perhaps he had been hit by a car and was lying in a coma somewhere maybe what he was experiencing was only a representation in his mind of what was really going on the steady regularity of his footfalls started to entrance him and his mind started to idle not really thinking much of anything after a time he was aware that he was holding something the slip of paper hed been given in the church it fluttered in his hand spinning gently in the wind it seemed an ordinary slip of paper but what was written on it was there anything on it if there was then he felt he should be able to read it but he couldnt perhaps it was blank he twirled it between his fingertips it was comforting to him hour after hour passed and he was gratified to see that he was definitely getting closer now not only had the green brushstroke along the horizon grown thicker it now nearly encompassed his whole field of vision this was encouraging to him even though he doubted that he had traveled much more than half of the distance necessary the sun he could see now was descending directly behind him gently warming his neck and shoulders he judged it would hit the mountain around the time that he reached the forest evening in other words just as he met the border of two different places the phrase like a pillar of smoke through a field of fog went through his head he began to feel stronglythough acknowledging he had no reason tothat he would meet someone once he reached the forest there would be a coincidence he started to pepper his pace with bursts of jogging eager to get the meeting under way if it was to happen or just to reach shelter if it wasnt the bottommost edge of the sun touched the very tip of the mountain which was now very clear against the sky being a dark purple daniel felt he would be able to say to himself that he was almost there he could now pick out individual trees from among the leafy mass but they seemed huge like the redwoods hed seen in pictures a couple more hoursthe timescale was making him feel anxious nowand he was about throwing distance from the first trees of the forest which looked to be fairly tightly packed the sun was low enough that the mountain seemed to be wearing it as a halo it threw a long shadow across the plain overtaking him and making him cold once more he put his coat back on daniel approached the forest cautiously on the lookout for any sign of someone besides himself his eyes searched the landscape for anything else in this place that wasnt grass or trees and he found it in a speck of white that moved along the base of the tree line far to the left of his vision it was a cloud of dust rising from the ground and speeding towards him ahead of the cloud was a frantically moving speck of light grey that occasionally flashed white there was a moist nostalgic smell of decaying leaves coming from the forest the setting sun now bisected and peering out from both sides of the mountain displayed two orange sections that bathed the trees in a reddish light making the treescape eerily beautiful it reminded daniel of another wall of incredibly beautiful trees a feeling of nervous anticipation grew inside of daniel as the white fluttering shape grew nearerit was a person on horseback daniel stopped near one of the trees and waited for the rider to catch up to him he wondered if he should draw his sword in this new vast and slow place he was able to watch the small image grow larger and larger until it slowed and stopped before him the rider was a man a young man on a brilliant white horse hail the rider said halting his magnificent animal hail responded daniel the two took a moment to study each other the riders face was fair and unwrinkled and was wearing a wry grin he had loose blond hair that was cropped short around the ears and neck and fell forward over his long brow he was dressed in a loose white shirt that billowed around the chest and shoulders but was gathered up and bound down the forearms to the wrists with ornate bands of cloth that appeared to be woven with gold he wore duncoloured leather trousers that stopped just below his knees and his feet were bare he sat atop the horse on a blanket that was bordered with intricate patterns the horse was of a medium sizedaniel had seen biggerbut it had a narrow muzzle and long sinewy legs that made it very fast thanks be to the king said the rider i truly believe you are he daniel didnt know what to say so he asked the question most pressing on his mind where am i you are in elflandthe faerie realms to be specific and because of that i cannot speak long it is important that you mark all that i say when the suns last rays vanish then i will be found and at that time we must already be parted elfland this was probably worse than he imagined whats your name daniel asked my name is kay marrey but first before any more is said the rider quickly and effortlessly dismounted daniel now saw that he was quite tall around six and a half feet he looked back to the horse reestimating its height elfland was taking some getting used to kay took a long stride towards daniel and snatched his coat from his hands he started going through the pockets what are you i can feel it like a buzzing insect ah here kay reached into the front pocket and pulled out the slip of paper that daniel had been given except now when kay held it daniel saw it was a leaf a large yellow oak leaf where did that come from daniel asked kay marrey held it upright by the stem between his thumb and forefinger you were given this yes in your world did you know what it was at first i thought it was money kay nodded it is a leaf of a different wood it was taken to your world as a way to mark and snare you still holding the leaf he rounded the horse and opened a satchel that was attached to his riding blanket he drew out a suede leather cloak that was a very lightgrey trimmed with white i am allowed to give you three gifts for you to keep for as long as you are in this land kay announced unfastening his cloak and this is the first he said whipping it off his shoulders thanks daniel said reaching out his hand wait kay said pulling it back give me your coat first take what you need from the pockets daniel did this and then handed his coat over kay told him how to fasten the cloak around his neck and then helped him on with his backpack how do i look kay asked pulling on daniels coat and holding his arms out for an appraisal very odd daniel replied kay laughed and stuck the leaf daniel had been given in the pocket of the coat he was now wearing now listenthis is what you need to know kay put his hands on daniels shoulders and looked him in the eyes this place is not like yoursit obeys different rules the most important of these for now is that objects have ownership it is essential that you dont take anything that isnt given to youfor if you steal something then that thing will own you and not the other way around for instance i gave you my cloak if you had taken it you would have been beholden to it do you understand daniel nodded slowly now i may give you your second gift he held out a sewnup skin covered in soft fur and laced with intricately woven straps it was evidently a water container of some sort carry it with you and take just a few sips at a time it holds more than it appears to daniel removed the stopper and took a gulp from it he was parched you are about to enter one of the enchanted forests kay continued if you take anythinga seed a leaf a pineconeand put it into your pocket you will not be able to return home if you eat anythinga berry a fruit or an animalthen this land will own you and you wont be able to return home do you understand daniel nodded again his head starting to spin what had he fallen into now however this wood is a friend of my people one moment i will introduce you to it saying that he turned to face the line of trees and started to sing in a different language when he had finished the forest seemed less intimidating somehow thats done said kay as he turned back to daniel so all you must do if you need anything is to ask for it and wait for it to be presented to you but to do this you must ask in a respectful wayyou must ask in verse in verse tunefully or if its easier for you in poem nothing fancy couplets work well just so the forest knows that you honour it but dont ask for anything frivolous as you may anger it this applies to everything even the water with which you are to fill the skin everything must be asked for and never just taken daniels head took another spin couplets fauna smaller birds can be trusted anything larger than a kestrel cannotand that includes kestrels burrowers are honest but theyre stupid except for foxes of coursedont talk to the foxes if you see a fox ignore it bears stay away from bears wolves shouldnt be a problem so long as you stick to the path the path ah the paththank you for reminding me when i have left you must enter the forest and travel until you reach a clearing any clearing will do then ask the forest for whatever you need in the nightfood bedding a fire dont ask for anything until nightyou may be seen otherwise when you are able to see the sun through the trees once more ask the forest to show you the path to the woodburners hut follow that path until you get to the woodburners hut the woodburners hut then what i cannot tell you why not because i do not know will the woodburner get me out of this place i dont know that either so what do you know only thiswhat i am doing now that which i was told to do which is far more than those who sent you here will suspect they sent you here thinking that this world would claim you these measures will prevent that so that you may one day soon return how do i know that i can trust you because i came here at great cost kay marrey looked over his shoulder to the setting sun just the tiniest slivers were still visible on either side of the mountain a cost that grows greater the longer i stop here he reached into a pouch at his belt this is my final gift he said unfastening a pouch at his belt and handing it to daniel daniel opened it and shook a flat stone about the size of a twopound coin into his palm it was a reddishbrown colour and rough keep this in your mouth when you stop to rest or are idle kay instructed him it bears no enchantment but those of your kind need such as this if they are to sojourn long in this land that is all i have to explain or give do you have any more questions daniel turned the stone over in his hand questions where to begin where are you from and who sent you here kay turned and went back to his horse he brushed its head and nuzzled it affectionately i was sent here by the doubted king of this world who will one day return to rule righteously is he a good king yes but that doesnt mean hell be good to you he does what is right for his kingdom even if that means that hes hard on his subjects am i one of his subjects kay rubbed his cheek against his horses muzzle and patted its head i dont know are you if im not why should i do what he wants kay whispered into his horses ear and gave it a smack on the rump it turned and cantered off the way it had come because hes right no time for more questions he said turning and scanning the sky enter the woods quickly now for i am being pursued by our enemies dont exit the woods no matter in what trouble you see me hurry now your life depends on it dont forget take nothing that is not given he called out oh he added and dont talk to dead people daniel started jogging towards the woods and then remembered that he hadnt heard the answer to one of his questions you never told me where you were from daniel shouted kay told him just as he started off at a run along the tree line daniel reached the trunk of a large pine and crouched behind it he watched kay speed away from him running easily the sun finally set leaving the sky a dusky pink just as daniel was about to stand he heard a screech from the sky which was followed by several more his eyes flicked upwards and he saw eight large birds black against the sky flapping and diving furiously at the small dark figure the black birdscrows maybedescended upon kay hurling themselves at his back and shoulders they were like guided missiles with sharpened beaks and talons that clawed at him then opening their wings they took to the sky only to swoop down upon their target again even at this distance daniel could see that his thick coat which had helped him tough out the cold streets of oxford was very quickly and easily ripped into shreds kay ducked into the forest and the birds gave a long piercing cry and followed him in then it was silent and still daniel took a breath and stood up it was getting colder now that the sun was gone although the sky was still bright if there was anyone after him he needed to make some headway into the forest before it got really dark and all the time the words of kay the rider echoed in his ears i come from the elves in exile who will one day return chapter six lights in the dark before with a start that jerked him nearly upright daniel awoke in less than a second the details of his dream flew from his memory and he was left with just a vague impression of fear and of falling he lay in the large bed a moment under the heavy covers the mattress was hard but not uncomfortable and the pillows soft and deep he rolled onto his back and looked up at the stone ceiling it was carved in what was becoming his favorite stylewith leaves and vines branches and twigs insects and small animals in an underground world the only thing available is a lot of stone and in hundreds of years with little else except for that around them theyve become very good at using it he thought his gaze floated around the unfamiliar room and picked out odd features his eyes became lost for long seconds as they wandered around the spiral pattern of the hanging carpets before moving on to a stone alcove lined with sitting cushions a brass stand holding a funny sort of clay lamp a stonetopped metal table with a bronze basin and clay pitcher on it and finally the wide fireplace with a long hanging wroughtiron frame that held his drying school clothes he felt slightly dizzy hed never slept in a room this big or nice before so he made himself smile he figured he was allowed to smile just to mark the occasion he was wearing a white linen sleeping gown which he had found folded on the table it was loose and comfortable and warm too warm his face was slick and clammy he had been sweating in his sleep either because of the thick bedding or the disturbing dream or both he pushed the sheets aside and stood up a thin sheen of sweat made his skin cold as he padded over to the dressing table he poured some water from the pitcher into the wide bowl and splashed a handful across his face the freshness was bracing and after drying himself with a thick linen cloth he felt like he was wearing a new layer of skin now feeling rather cold he shuffled over to the fireplace and stretched out his hands expectantly but after a moment or two he found that they were not warming as they ought the fire was large and crackling but squinting into it he saw that it was not really burning the flames that danced energetically around the logs and up the chimney were not healthy orange and red flames but were pale and yellow almost green in places and appeared very thin no smoke was given off and he almost had to climb into the fireplace just to warm his palms enchanted fire he thought with a frown he moved back to the table next to the bowl where he had found the bedgown some new clothes had been placed while he was asleephis mind went back to his own house and the presents he never received he shook out the first item and held up a darkblue shirt the type that the servants cnafa and cnapa wore he smiled new clothes he quickly shook out the other items wondering how to put them on the thick shirt made daniel think of a sewnup bathrobe and was probably meant to be worn on top it was made of a heavy finely woven clothwool maybe it was rough on the outside but lined with very smooth linen on the inside it had large sleeves and was embroidered with blue on a darker blue floral design beneath the shirt were some paleblue leggings a thin shirt some leather slippers with laces and a broad belt he pulled the thin undershirt over his head and then started hitching up the leggingswhich he found had no opening in the feet meaning that he needed no socks he was able to fasten them with a thin drawstring that cinched just below his belly he shrugged on the thick blue overshirt which reached halfway down his thighs and fastened the leather belt around his waist then he sat down on the edge of his bed to try to put on his shoes which were more a kind of slipper the soles were thin but tough there was a single long leather lace that crisscrossed the top of the shoe and once he tied them tightly around his feet they became with the stockings rather comfortable and snug he smoothed his new clothes down and straightened himself out as well as he could not having a mirror he walked around the room a couple times wriggling his arms around enjoying movement in this strange outfitits crisp cleanness and smell he liked how the clothes felttough yet comfortable he started running and then jumped up and down several times laughing he hoped hed be allowed to keep them he wondered if freya was awake and what her clothes were like he pulled open the heavy door and stepped out into the hallway going towards her room he ran into her halfway down the hallway sitting in an alcove and staring out of one of the tall thin windows she was in her school clothes which were dry but very wrinkled and dirty she had one arm wrapped around her legs and one close to her chest she was fingering the little pendant on her silver birthday necklace as daniel approached she turned her head away from the window and looked him up and down what are you wearing she asked frowning they laid these out for me didnt you get any freyas eyebrows pinched together as she studied daniel dont you want to go home of course whats that got to do with anything and youre going to go back dressed like that why not he smoothed down the front of his shirt with his palm theyre very warm comfortable looking at freyas expression daniel felt as if he were a bad essay that she was marking what dont you miss your family daniel looked at the floor his joy was slipping away as if draining out of his feet i mean pursued freya we dont even know how long it will take us to get back daniel shrugged or even if we can get back exclaimed freya becoming agitated so what if we never go back daniel murmured whats so good about normal life anyway he said angrily this is a real adventure its better than ordinary life any day better have you looked out there freya said jerking her head towards the window daniel raised himself up on his toes outside the window past his own reflection he could see the streets and houses of niergeard illuminated in the torchlight beyond the treecarved wall lay the dirty campfires of the yfelgopes stretching off into the distance like a flickering ocean of stars there must be thousands of them out there freya said quietly ive been watching for a long time i cant see any of those things but if each one of those dots of light has even just three or four around it her voice trailed off what if they all decide to attack us daniel sniffed then well kill them just like we did in the tunnels we freya echoed daniel sucked at his top lip anyway were safe here with the walls and guards and everything he said defiantly we dont know that freya said we only think were safe how do we know what those knights want to do with us if they wanted us to be safe why didnt they take us home why didnt we wait in the church until the doorway opened again who is this modwyn when do we meet ealdstan whats going on daniel said nothing freya turned back to the window look at those people wandering around below look at those buildings she continued her voice rising how could something like this exist and nobody know about it how could we not hear about it in school or on tv well said daniel after the shortest of pauses grownups dont know everything they always pretend that they do but havent you ever gotten the feeling that i dont know that they dont really believe a lot of the explanations they havethat theyre saying them as much to themselves as they are to us to make them feel better this place explains so much didnt you ever think that there must be another world underneath the real one no daniel this is insane this shouldnt be happening at all ancient knights and enchantments that doesnt happen anymore if it ever did happen no one believes in it its happening now whether you want it to or so youre saying you believe in all of this what are you talking about i cant choose what i believe like you apparently can especially when its actually happening to me freya frowned grimly and shook her head its like a bad dream yeah but you cant stop a dream you have to go along with it until you wake up what if you dont wake up then you try to change it freya turned to look back out the window i just want to go back home where i know im safe she said i feel as thoughits like in the wizard of oz you know i feel like ive been ripped up by a tornado and im just spinning and spinning and still havent really come down yet daniel picked at the hem of his shirt anyway he said after a time lets go find swigar and ecgbryt and then maybe this mysterious wizard ealdstan i can get a brain you can get some courage and then we can click our ruby slippers together and go home freya gave a broken laugh and sniffed okay she said sliding out of the alcove they started to walk off down the corridor so what did you get was it a dress or something yes a darkred one go put it on ill wait no sure yes go on i bet youd look nice be quiet as freya and daniel started down the twisting staircase a loud and lively clamor drifted up from below them i hope they have food said freya im starving i think they do do you smell that smells smoky but nice they reached the ground floor and looked around the noise a pleasant rise and fall of happy voices was coming from a wide doorway under the opposite staircase they walked through it and found stone tables and benches ranked down a long hall the benches closest to the door were empty but there was a cluster of people at the other end making a respectable racket ecgbryt was one of these and was the first to notice them standing he raised a hornshaped object above his head and hallooed them in a bellowing voice wes u hale young daniel and fair freya he called out cnafa approached daniel and freya and motioned them to follow he led them to the table at the end of the hall on one side of the table sat swigar and ecgbryt and on the other two broad grizzled men with the pale dry faces shared by all who lived in niergeard the table was empty save for a large clay jug and oddly shaped cups in front of each person ecgbryt and one of the gentlemen had clay pipes in their mouths and were smoking a rich tobacco they slid onto the bench with the knights did you sleep well swigar asked daniel and freya nodded wordlessly from a door in the corner two servants entered carrying several platters they silently approached the table and laid the strange dishes before the new arrivals one held a dried meat sausage as big as daniels arm the next contained a pile of thin crispy bread the last was a plate of orange and lime slices shallow clay bowls were placed in front of them along with two very sharp knives freya broke off a piece of bread how long were we asleep she asked popping it in her mouth as daniel picked up his knife and started to saw into the meat oh not very long answered ecgbryt as he drew on his pipe only five or six years daniels eyebrows shot up freya nearly choked on the bread she was chewing what she gasped as i said not long not long at all a smile broke ecgbryts solemn face and he broke into laughter the other men at the table did as well daniel grinned sheepishly and freya muttered something under a frown the boys eyes nearly fell into his plate hooted one of the other men no said ecgbryt bringing his laughter under control with an effort hours only hours not years forgive me butbut this is excellent ale he held his silverrimmed horn aloft and clanked it against his neighbors cup they both drank glad to see you awake said swigar to daniel and freya you will not have met these men i will let them introduce themselves greetings said the man across from ecgbryt wiping his mouth he had a squarish build and a large mane of dark shaggy hair that stuck out at every angle his face was blunt and puckered here and there with scars to freya it looked as if hed been chewed up by some giant beast and spat out for all she knew she reflected he had been my name is godmund he said slapping his chest with a fist the fishscale armour that encased him clanked and rattled it means goodhand and was given to me by ealdstan himself i am niergeards shield thaneits protector my name said the man next to him a bald and thin man with a pinched face long moustache and wiry arms is frithfroth i oversee the order of this magnificent keep i am the torr thane if ever you have need of anything on this side of the tall towers door but mention it in my presence and it will be brought to you with all possible speed i give especial welcome hi im freya reynolds the heads at the table turned to daniel who smiled and announced grandly my name is daniel tully i am a student of the isis c of e secondary school in the town of oxford my mother gave me my name though i dont know what it means i greet you he raised up the horn in front of him in a salute to the delight of the table he put the cup to his lips and lifted the bottom up up and up until it was upside down over his face nothing came out to the laughter of everyone in the hall even freya muffled a small snort behind her hand swigar reached across and took daniels cup from him he poured a small amount of pale liquid from one pitcher and some water from another he handed it back to daniel who completed his toast to a cheer those around the table gazed gleefully at daniel and freya as they ate suddenly godmunds pipe jumped from his lips i have it he cried it is an onion and not before time frithfroth said smirking take your turn very well said godmund laying his pipe carefully on the table and interlocking his fingers clearing his throat he spoke slowly and deliberately a deadly destroyer divinely descended awakes only when warring stirring when silent objects are struck he is highly borne to battle by foe to fight against foe though incredibly fierce and madly wild a woman will wrangle him though satisfying they who serve and tend him the more you feed him the hungrier you make him he who builds this battler up is doubly delighted but death follows he who carelessly lets this warrior loose samson ecgbryt answered immediately godmund shook his head anger answered swigar godmund smiled and shook his fuzzy head once again the hall was silent as the puzzler looked smugly around the table each in their own manner either scratched his head silently repeated lines of the riddle or stared into nothing daniel and freya looked on with interest as they continued placing meat and bread into their mouths godmund smiled and tapped out a layer of ash from his pipe picking up a splint of wood about the thickness of a match he held it to the candle in front of him and then brought it up to his cold pipe bowl he puffed a few times and then held it away his face appeared thoughtful gazing at the flame as it traveled up the splint towards his fingers ecgbryt his eyes flickering idly across the table saw him gently blowing on the flame rather playfully he thought a moment and then his eyes grew wide fire he exclaimed the answer is fire godmund blew out the flame and nodded as the table applauded the guesser it was now ecgbryts turn at last he said stroking his long moustache and i have a most excellent riddle for you alla rare and wise riddle it is as well for king lfred the great himself did teach me this riddle from his own lips he cleared his throat a river twice wet me after woodframe had stretched me once sharp knife had scraped me and a young man first cut me then the sun it did dry me now my hair had all left me and some cinders then rubbed me before fingers had folded me a feather has dyed me a reed also stained me now two boards press on me and gold bands gird round me what am i ecgbryt sat back finished and very pleased with himself for a full three seconds until swigar said i have it hold knight said frithfroth youve answered your sharerather youve answered your share and three others let the rest of us try with a twinkling eye ecgbryt poured himself a horn kippered herring frithfroth answered somewhat hastily no but a near guess the table dropped into thoughtful silence a moment more a fishing bark answered godmund with oars and hmm feathers no there was a further silence until kippers frithfroth insisted kippers or cod ecgbryt laughed and shook his head if there are no more guesses beyond kippers swigar drawled then perhaps i might be allowed the table assented a book he said simply ecgbryt reluctantly clapped his hands as the rest of the table nodded to themselves swigar began his riddle there is a strong savagely bold houseguest who is the lord of my hearts dwellingplace hunger does not hurt my ferocious friend he thirsts ages but is not diminished treat him honourably and with respect and you will receive good fortune when you travel with him all the days of your life and at the end of the highway you are ensured a warm welcome into his vast family but misery rewards the servant who mistreats this most holy of visitors with him ahead of me i will not fear when this friend kinsman guest travels onward while i am forced to stay by the roadside ever willing to part as once we must never again being able to meet friends if you please speak the name or title of either this royal householddweller or my own name both whom i have described there was a groan from frithfroth as he placed his head in his hands by the devils nose hairs youre a hard riddler it sounds like fire again godmund grumbled there are allowed swigar with an agreeable nod similarities between the two yes the table was stumped ecgbryt scratched his head godmund kicked the table and frithfroth muttered oaths not heard in the british isles for centuries eventually swigar was convinced to give them the answer the soul the body is the host the soul the guest frithfroth and godmund insisted on a second reciting of the riddle and then sat in silence rather morosely forced to stay by the roadside muttered godmund and blinked his grey eyes slowly a heaviness fell upon the hall daniel and freya being adequately fed by their dry meal sat in silence amused and bewildered by the game i have one daniel piped into the melancholy whats brown and sticky nobody at the table guessed they just shook their heads a stick daniel said everyone burst into laughter as much in relief as in actual humor daniel himself laughed as hard as anyone heres another he said which room has no door no windows no floor and no roof no guesses a mushroom now what is enough daniel enough give another a turn or at least a chance to breathe godmund said his pallid face sweaty and bright with laughing one more one morewhats red and sticky beeswax strawberries earwax honey nope all wrong give up everyone nodded enthusiastically its that bloody stick again this brought the loudest roar yet and even tears to some eyes which was why no one noticed that modwyn had entered stifffaced she waited patiently for the laughter to die down everyone sobered when they caught sight of her and the bellows gave way to chuckles that died silently ealdstan will see you she announced the grandly dressed modwyn led daniel and freya followed by swigar and ecgbryt up staircase after staircase they followed her with an increasing sense of cautious curiosity as they crept farther and farther up into the dark centre of the tower daniel walking behind modwyn broke the silence of their ascent is ealdstan really seventeen hundred years old as near as can be counted the niercwen replied time was measured differently when he was young days of birth were not recorded as they are now is he a wizard yes she began thoughtfully he could be considered one the word wizard simply means wise one and ealdstan is unquestionably the wisest of men is he like the wizards in the books and fairy tales like merlin or someone he may be modwyn allowed it is possible that you have read about him already but do not know it he has been called by many names throughout his lifecast his shadow upon the ages she thought for a few moments then said what evidence there is in history and what truth there is in myth of the wise old men in your books and fairy tales has undoubtedly been ealdstan he has counseled kings bishops and emperorsbut it is long since anyone sought his advice how long over two hundred years does he still go up to the real world no what does he do he studies now there are his books his own writings the writings of others the myths and wise tales of days long ago it sounds lonely daniel said stair after stair fell behind them the carvings on the walls became less and less elaborate the higher they went until what was a beautiful embossed frieze depicting ocean life devolved gradually into a primitive running spiral the bannister turned from an ornately wrought metal lattice of eels and seaweed into a simple twisted band that is the price he pays she said and it took daniel a few seconds to realise that she was still following the conversation the price he pays for what daniel asked the price he pays for his wisdom wisdom which is experience and reflection over time so the older he gets the wiser he gets as do we allalmost all there are some people and creatures who are proud and who have exchanged wisdom for vanity daniel considered this but how wise is he anyway how can i tell unless i am as wise as he only wisdom can recognise itself well youre old so you must be wise toounless youre proud modwyns lips thinned in a small brief smile the only thing i have learned in my long years is that i have not learned enough i have always been wise enough to know that i am not as wise as i would like to be daniel frowned and modwyn continued but as for ealdstanhe is the most intelligent of all earthly beings he has meditated lifetimes on single ideas he has pursued trains of thought for hundreds of years and his interests are unlimited he has sowed patience and reaped knowledge has sifted it and nourished himself on the grain i do not think that any created being knows as much about the workings of the world as heit would be impossible for anyone to conceive of learning it there is more than he could pass on in a lifetime they turned off the staircase and into a cold hallway past dark crudely carved rooms which contained books and loose papers crammed into bookcases up ahead they saw a fluttering light they approached it and filed into what turned out to be a narrow room that contained many barred windows that opened out into niergeard it was from behind as he gazed out one of these windows that daniel and freya first saw the bent form of ealdstan he was wearing a robe made of bright red and yellow patterned with bands that wove in and out of each other in alternating rows of red and purple he did not turn immediately as they entered but slowly pulled his gaze away from the window and let it drift around the room ealdstans age showed in his manner if nowhere else his ancient face although weathered was not decrepit a yellowing beard stretched down past his waist but it was bushy and full his head was high domed but not bald lustrous hair fell down behind his shoulders his arm seen when his sleeve was drawn was not withered it was smooth and well muscled with quick dexterous hands and fingers at the end of them but his eyes were pale grey watery and very very weary at first daniel thought ealdstan was blind his pupils were so drab and unresponsivelying listless in their hooded sockets it took a long time for his face to show any acknowledgment of their presence and when he raised his voice to welcome his visitors it was the two smaller figures he greeted first i dont believe he breathed in a thin voice that ive had the pleasure there was an expectant pause ii am daniel tully sir im freyafreya reynolds really ealdstan trailed his voice not much above a whisper are you really are you ealdstan asked freya yes i am or as much of ealdstan as is left we have heard that you are very wise am i i suppose speaking comparatively of course all of ealdstans sentences trailed off making conversation awkward it was hard to tell if he was at the end of a breath or a reply shall we sit at the other end of the room were a long stone table and many short stone stumps that were used as stools ealdstan placed himself at the head of the table on the far side of the room daniel and freya sat at the opposite end and the others found places in between the table was covered with bits of paper of many different types shapes and sizes some were thick and brown and were written on in faded ink in blocky raggedyedged letters filling sheet after sheet each word looking indecipherably similar to the last other pages were newer thinner almost translucent with rough fibers here and there showing through the paper they were mostly scrawled on with an elaborate spidery script there were some oddly bound books both large and small of the type that freya had seen only in museums which gave glimpses of illuminated letters and detailed pictures so ealdstan breathed apparently to himself swigar and ecgbryt have come back have they and why is that swigar he repeated as if trying to remember who went with the name ecgbryt he was silent long enough for swigar to jump in it was because of the lifiendes ealdstan dryhtwisa the mortal children yes and why did you not chase them off or put them to the sword daniel blinked freya gasped and opened her mouth soundlessly for a few seconds before she managed to stutter youyou couldnt have just we can and do ealdstan interrupted do you children think that you are the first to happen upon one of the chambers of the sleeping knights and you killed them for finding you freya turned from ealdstan to swigar hmm i have never killed an innocent swigar said the enchantment is strong it stops all from entering nearly all swa swa swigar ecgbryt said his face suddenly bright do you remember that curate who stumbled upon us when you grabbed his sleeve he leapt so far back that his cassock shush broor this is not the time said swigar peevishly we are fighting a hidden war ealdstan said the position of our troops is of the foremost importance even a guileless fool can let slip vital information that would allow the enemy to strike a severe blow we battle for the souls of millions and the lives of a few are light in the balance there was a short silence following ealdstans words which was broken by swigar ealdstan he said we have observed the situation outside the wall the old man turned tired eyes on the knight how long has the siege lasted ealdstan did not answer only just gazed at him some months modwyn eventually replied what has been done asked ecgbryt roughly modwyn looked to ealdstan who still gave no reply very little she responded we still have many supplies and are able to travel rather freelythe yfelgop have not discovered all routes in and out of the geard but something must be done insisted ecgbryt what are their numbers we cannot tell modwyn spoke slowly or even estimate all we can do is count the campfires how many are they ecgbryt pursued stern in his questioning of hundreds nearly nine how many to a fire can you assay that we do not know perhaps as many as eight you have made no sallies none there are times when a handful of them will climb the walls but they never get past the parapets and we never capture them alive who leads them asked swigar once we used the tunnels to listen to them modwyn continued slowly there are two leaders a master and a general though they would mention only the general by name he is called kelm kafhand do you know anything of the master asked swigar only that he is powerful cruel and commands much fear to rule the yfelgop it is gad ealdstan said and sneered startling the others gad gristgrenner the gastbona he spat as if each word were a mouthful of bile it is him he was the worst of all the old enemies yet ive not heard of him said swigar nor i said ecgbryt he is cunning it has been many years since he has trod the earth but now his power grows and he has become bold i do not wonderwith so little to challenge him ecgbryt remarked darkly what would you have us do ealdstan replied run out of the gates and smite down the enemy our numbers are few ecgbryt hardaxe there are over one hundred sleeping knights underneath this very towerthe finest warriors that have ever existed what have numbers ever meant to ealdstan the ancient do not goad me of might and wisdom ealdstan hissed we have ever exercised the rarer and more precious of those virtues in niergeard might is no virtue ecgbryt knocked back but determination is remember your place ealdstan rasped his face contracting spittle flying from his lips remember it or i shall name you hardhead to go with your virtues hardhead the hackhand when lfred fought off the danes at thelney he would your precious lfred is dead ealdstan spat i buried him myself so you will have to continue along as best you can with who he has left behind ecgbryt smoldered under this reprimand ealdstan was now incensed he bent forward in his chair breathing quickly eyes flashing in their deep sockets he calmed gradually and leaned back again pinching out a long sigh compared to the battle that is to come ealdstan grumbled his voice suddenly as sharp as the sound of stone scraping against stone this is not even a scuffle armies greater and more frightsome than we can comprehend are gathering in the dark corners of this rockarmies that may crush us into powder that is the conflict we must cast our minds tonot this insignificant tussle the grand cataclysm is approaching very well said swigar then what must we do to prepare ealdstan cleared his throat and suddenly his voice was weak again and faltering i have been reading studying the manuscripts his hands started to move and he shifted some of the papers around the table uncertainly it is hard to know where current events fall the prophecies seem shuffled now accuracy is notaccuracy has been lost to hell with the prophecies said swigar you know of the coming conflictthe cataclysm what is to be done this age moaned ealdstan this age is so cold hearts are bitter and guts are bilious there are no more heroes there are none to help us from this eranone with strength in their soul to do what needs be done what is to be done ealdstan repeated turning his grey eyes to swigar only this pray that we have done enough in the past to be ready for the future there is nothing further to prepare the people of this time have forsaken us are you certain that it is not you who have forsaken them swigar replied ealdstans lips clenched together tightly as he ground his teeth daniels and freyas pale faces looked around the room ecgbryt glowered at the centre of the table fuming swigar sat with his chin stuck out and his fists clenched in front of him modwyns eyes met theirs and for the first time they saw living emotion in thememotions of sorrow and dismay it was ecgbryt who spoke next niergeard under siege is not a scuffle when was the beacon extinguished ive seen men fight without an arm but never without a head in the war we wage all battles are vital and action must be taken if the yfelgop opposition is truly inconsequential then let us rid ourselves of them and press our advantage i propose we make a foray to test their strength and numbers information may be gleaned that could shed more light on events if may could ealdstan spat testily you have no conception of gads powers hed swat you away like a child fanning a fly he leaned forward and made brusque sweeping motions with his hand then settled back peevishly very well make your attack in the event that something is found of which i have no current knowledge please feel free to share we have your permission then permission why should you want that when you will not accept my counsel permission to do what risk death and capture simply to smell the enemys sweat yes by all means go leave me in peace dont leave the doors unbarred too long ealdstan stood and the others rose with him thank you wys fder said swigar bowing his head be gone the others muttered similar thanks as they started to file out of the room daniel and freya hung back the last to leave standing in the doorway a little bewildered wait a second freya blurted nervously calling after the others wait we didnt come here for this mr ealdstan she said turning to him sir daniel and iwe came here because we want to go home but we couldnt because the tunnel was sealed up and we didnt really have a choice we dont belong here we belong at home with our parents can you please show us the way out of here ealdstan listened to her with his head bowed over a dusty parchment so old it was cracking as freya finished he raised his head and blinked at her out you cannot leave this place werent you listening its far too dangerous youd be killed or worse modwyn just said that they hadnt found all the exits yet so therere tunnelspassages that those yfelgop things havent discovered yet we came along the river we slipped in i know that we can slip out again maybe we could there is no safe passage no escape he bent his head back down to the table and finished by muttering if there is no escape for us why should there be any for you but were not a part of thisthis world none of this matters to uswere not important they might not bother even chasing us no but leave freya was shockedthe blood drained from her face leaving her cold frozen to the spot she felt daniel tugging at her arm and whispering her name but she pulled her arm out of his handsthis was too important to back down from we want to leave she yelled at the top of her lungs but you wont let us you have knights you have magic you have secret tunnels let us go ealdstans face twisted into an ugly mask of spite stupid little brownskinned girl he sneered through a clenched jaw in several unexpectedly quick strides he approached freya his ancient hand gripped her arm and with surprising strength he flung her out of the doorway and into the hall she staggered a little and then ungracefully fell on her rear hey daniel shouted dont do that dont do that ealdstan ignored him and grabbed the edge of the large metal door and slammed it shut with a fluid motion and because daniel was still standing in the doorway he took some of the force on his shoulder and one of the doors rivets punched into his arm he closed his eyes as excruciating pain flooded his body he grabbed his arm and swore with all the worst words he knew he didnt think hed ever been hit that hard he kicked and pounded the door which was so heavy and strong that it hardly made a noise oi you daniel shouted between pounds ealdstan get out of here you coward why not take me on instead of pushing around a girl oi ealdstan ealdstan daniel pounded and kicked for another moment until his hands and feet ached then he turned and saw that modwyn and the knights were standing around freya ecgbryt must have helped her uphis hand was still on her shoulder freya was looking at him with wide watery eyes come lifiendes swigar said we have matters to discuss he then turned and they all started down the hall grimacing daniel came alongside freya dont worry freya he said well find a way to get homesoon they all started down the stairs in silence modwyn led them to a room on the fifth level that was nothing more than a completely square chamber with carved ledges in the wall that were used for seating there was a low metal table in the middle of the room modwyn pulled a rope and a small bell tinkled in the distance how long has ealdstan been thus swigar asked the door opened and cnafa stepped into the room bring a map of the nierland and send godmund here she instructed and then turned to swigar ealdstan has been in such spirits for some time even before the siege she replied in a hushed voice listless and melancholic we do not see him for months on end and when we do he passes by without acknowledgment or sign leaving us to wonder if we have in truth seen him at all i am sorry that my temper overcame me brother ecgbryt apologised you should not have let me hound the man no it was well that you did i doubt many have challenged him of late and i agreewhy not simply wake a band of knights to come and break the siege swigar asked gruffly drive the nasty filth back into the deep tunnels the solution is so simple that its maddening i would challenge him were it my place stated modwyn it would not have been right agreed swigar ecgbryt and i can be excused our rudeness the door reopened and godmund entered with a long scroll which he placed on the table he unfurled it to show a map of the underground realm a large oblong with little branches that represented tunnels leading off the sides niergeard was marked in the middle a small knot of structures and streets they started talking about where the yfelgop army was thickest where they had come from and many other details daniel watched with fascination as the small military strike was planned and tactics discussed we have no idea where their main force is godmund said we suspect it may be herehe placed a hand on a section of the mapbut who is to say that they do not move it or that they are split equally in different areas what are their main routes into the plain swigar asked there is no way to know that either seeing that you encountered them it is possible that they have infiltrated most of the upper tunnelsthere would be little enough to prevent the beasts from overrunning them but do they circulate randomly are most of them here are they gathered somewhere else how can we know none of that matters right now came an unexpected voice from among them all eyes turned to freya who was standing near the table looking down on the map we wont learn everything in just one raid freya continued her voice quavering slightly the important thing is to test their numbers their strength and their reaction after thatthat will tell us a lot then we can judge the appropriate measures to take once we have evaluated our resources then we can go home you can find a way to break the siege and so on ecgbryt smiled grimly and placed a huge hand on freyas shoulder the girl has a good head for these matters he said i just want to go home freya said trying to avoid daniels gawking stare swigar frowned then its decided he said we will raid them leaving through the main gates here he brought his hand down on an area of the map enough talking that is what we will do next in addition to swigar and ecgbryt the raiding party consisted of godmund and three of his best men his champions to daniel they looked like superheroesstocky with a lot of weight in the chest and shoulders one of them had a red bushy beard and long plaited hair his armour was made of mediumsized brass rings interlocked with one another one man had black hair and skin that was still slightly olive colour despite being very pale the third was a man taller than any knight they had seen so far he was so tall he looked slightly clumsy and uncomfortable his whitishblond hair was uncombed and matted like a sheepdogs shaggy coat he carried a spear in the same hand as his shield and casually gripped a massive war hammer in the other they were all big and strong and although their dress varied they all wore helmets made of iron with a sculpted figure of an ox on the crest the three new knights moved sluggishly and creakily slower than the others daniel and freya wondered if they had just been wokenand if they could really stand up to the erratic frenzy of the yfelgopes especially if there were as many out there as they all imagined and then with no more preparations to be made they were ready to depart the six knights mounted their stallions and set off through the city at a gentle canter the torchlight played on their armour making it sparkle and shine the gold tracing reflected the light brilliantly it looked as if living fire were flowing through the metal freya and daniel followed walking behind the six riders and were soon joined by others niergearders working in smithies guards in their barracks and masons in their workshops seeing the knights pass by dropped what they were doing stood and hurried to fall into step behind them the silent procession had swelled to over fifty people when the knights reached the large city gate they stood for a few moments making final preparations adjusting the harnesses of their mounts shifting weapons in their hands and whispering short prayers godmund shield thane of niergeard and leader of the war host motioned to two guardsmen on either side of the gate the gigantic hinges started to creak the large entrance opened a crack and then a bell was heard in the distanceit was a deep solid toll coming from the other end of the city the crowd tensed and started to mutter in confusion whats going on freya asked daniel shook his head the effect of the bell on the knights was instantaneous and dramatic several of them jerked back hard on their horses reigns causing them to rear upwards and turn around stop the gate yelled godmund to the guard above him shut it the knights leaned forward in their saddles scanning the buildings in front of them ready to gallop back into the city hold cried swigar hold wait for the horns the gate shut behind the knights godmund turned to ecgbryt get everyone to the tall tower he shouted ecgbryt trotted through the crowd that opened a path for him everyone this way ecgbryt bellowed leading them back into the city whats going on daniel shouted niergeard is being attacked someone answered behind him that bell tolls a breach at the south wall just then the sound of a highpitched horn was heard from a far corner of the city the other knights spurred their horses and galloped off along the smooth stone streets and were soon out of view hurry now ecgbryt said shepherding the crowd move quickly i do not know how they breached the wall without being seen but i suspect devilry daniel and freya tried their level best to stay with the crowd as they fled for the safety of the langtorr the streets buildings and city guards blurred past them as they struggled to keep up with ecgbryt horns sounded from other parts of the city freya and daniel kept their eyes on the tall tower remembering its thick iron doors freya grabbed daniels shoulder and pointed up at the tower following her finger daniel saw a flicker of bright red and yellow in one of the windows several stories up it was ealdstan gripping the window frame with one foot on its ledge as they watched he launched himself forward and fell his robes billowing and flapping around him like flames on a burning arrow he quickly dropped out of sight below the roofline of the houses daniel tried to shout to ecgbryt but it was no use he couldnt make his voice heard over the clamor they had just turned a corner and had their first glimpse of the tall towers gates when the yfelgopes caught up with them the creatures had scaled the buildings and were jumping from roof to roof towards the centre of the city out of the reach of the guards nine of the creatures dropped into the road ahead of the crowd ecgbryt halted his horse and ushered the fleeing townspeople down a side street the yfelgopes each of them sprouting sharp bits of metal from joints and fingers ran towards them snarling and barking from around the corner of a building daniel and freya watched ecgbryt charge forward galloping into one end of the line of attackers with his spear couched in his arm he drove into the swarming knot of yfelgopes skewering a creature on his left with his spear and batting another two away with the edge of his shield releasing his spear he drew his axe and sliced cleanly through the neck of an yfelgop that was slashing at his leg and stirrup his horse reared underneath him as one of the twisted men raked at the horses flank ecgbryt kept his saddle and brought his axe down into the attackers head with a juicy thok the yfelgopes left standing became even more enraged and bestial with quick darting movements they surrounded the lone knight ecgbryt reared his horse to make a break out of the ring when a shout rang out from a side street five of the city guards led by breca the guard at the western well swept upon the invaders in a pale gleaming fury their speed was controlled and effectiveevery blow that fell was either crippling or deadly in a very short time the yfelgopes were dispatched hwaet breca ecgbryt said addressing the guardsman what news the wall has been breached few have enteredvery few it is possible that this attack is a feint or that the force was not so great as we thought ecgbryt suggested perhaps replied breca signaling to his men we go to join the forces already guarding the carnyx the rest have been ordered to sweep the city swa swa i will join that number ecgbryt replied tugging on his mounts reins when i have delivered the rest to safety god by ye breca said and turned to order his men ecgbryt urged his horse forward and away after the fleeing citizens plucking his upright spear from the chest of its victim he caught up with the crowd just as the first and fastest of them entered the gate of the langtorr daniel with freya clinging to his arm turned just as he started up the steps of the torr he saw ecgbryt halt his horse and dismount as people flooded in around him he heard growls and screams as yfelgopes leapt from the rooftops and two of the knights in the raiding party came into sight being pursued by a swarm of the twisted creatures as they ran across the wide courtyard that separated the langtorr from the rest of the city daniel paused to look at the squat building that protected the great carnyx a body of guards breca amongst them was encircling it on the outside as warriors on the inside ran to take up places around the structures battlements freya pulled daniels arm very hard and he allowed himself to be dragged forward but in the pushing and jostling of the crowd she lost her grip on him springing up the steps he tried to catch up with her once inside the crowd scattered in confusion servants tried to herd the refugees into the banquet hall but everyone was taking stock of themselves looking for companions and staggering in exhaustion daniel tried to see through the commotion but couldnt find freya anywhere he called out her name but had trouble hearing even his own voice over the din he was about to enter the hall with all the others when he saw a swift movement out of the corner of his eye he looked up and saw that someone was running up one of the staircases freya she must be headed to her roombut why he leapt up the stairs after her and ran down the hallway to her door it was closed but he flipped the latch and threw himself against it expecting it to be locked or barred but it swung open easily freya he hissed there was no answer he tried again freya where are you a sound came from under the bed shh freya what are you doing under there lets get with the others there was no reply he bent down and stuck his head underneath the bed frame freya its safer in the hall you dont know that they have weapons to protect us i dont care there are too many of thosethosethings find someplace to hide or go back to the others but just get out of here im not going to leave you alo at that instant the door flew open with a bang daniel spun around and let out a shout of surprise then his heart froze in the doorway crouched a snarling yfelgop it wore loose bits of plate armour over its bare skin that was painted with an angry black zigzag pattern its head was inhumanly white as if it had been bleached the thing brandished a short crooked and fearsomely pointed spear in one hand let out a curdling scream and leapt daniel dove out of the way and the creature skittered across the covers of the bed sinking its fingernails into the mattress it spun itself around and crouched to leap at him again daniel lunged forward and pulled hard on the thick bed sheet flipping the yfelgop onto its back he threw the cover on top of it as the thing spat and writhed rushing to the fireplace daniel snatched up a poker the only weapon he could see to hand as the sound of ripping cloth came from behind him he spun around and lofted the heavy blunt length of iron the yfelgop crouched in the middle of a pile of shredded cloth trying to free itself with a jagged knifeand jerking away the tough threads that were caught on its rough armour daniel saw his opportunity yelling he dashed forward swinging the poker in a wide arc the yfelgop dipped sideways and deflected the blow with an armoured arm but the blow clipped him on the temple the momentum in the swing carried daniel and he felt his feet slip from under him he landed lengthways on the floor grunting and snorting the beast tumbled out of the bed and landed on top of himdaniel felt sharp knees dig into his sides as a clawlike hand gripped his throat he saw the jagged knife silhouetted against the ceiling and desperately swung the poker against the ugly snarling face but managed only enough force to bat the yfelgops head to the side snarling the yfelgop slashed at daniel with its talonlike fingers daniel cried out his eyes squeezing shut in pain when he opened them again he saw the arm once again drawn back to strike daniel scrambled for the poker and felt his fingers close around it but it was too late the knife sailed through the airand then clanked to the floor the yfelgop choked and glared hatefully at daniel its eyes angry and wild it leant forward slowly and spat a gob of sticky blood against the side of his face and shoulder then it slumped heavily against him letting out a ragged gurgling sigh as its eyes rolled back in its head daniel looked up and saw freya standing over him and the body of his attacker her face was terrified and tearstreaked she was holding the yfelgops black crooked spear still partially entangled in the bed sheet and now also planted between the creatures shoulder blades at the base of its boney neck she gave the dark metal a sharp twist and the thing against daniel twitched and lurched with a mighty heave freya tore the spear from the corpse and daniel pushed the fetid body off of him he stared up at freya who was huffing through clenched teeth and he started to cry chapter seven useful poetry now freya awoke and tried to remember where she was first she thought that she was back home at her parents house but then she remembered that she was at university she pulled the duvet tighter around her shoulders and burrowed into the mattress it was quiet today she couldnt hear any cars in the street below maybe it was early still she turned her head and opened her eyes to see how bright it was and froze then with a sudden lurch she convulsed upwards she wasnt in her dorm or her parents house she didnt know where she was morning sunlight shone through the window falling on a bed that was definitely not hers it smelled clean but it wasnt the detergent that she usually used which she found sickening it was a small but serviceable room clean and with no ornamentation besides the nightstand there was a little wooden chair draped with her clothing and a dresser the ceiling sloped downwards at one end where there was a dormer window with a scrolling shade and then there was a door shut leading to somewhere she didnt know she rose cautiously ears keen for any sound at all she grabbed her jeans and sweatshirt and dressed frantically her eyes sweeping the room there was a book on the nightstanda hardback without a cover its spine was imprinted in gold and read histories vol viiiport there was a bookmark in it and she opened it up she scanned the page but it didnt seem familiarnot the sort of book she would be reading she closed it and placed it back on the table trying not to think about the door she went to the dresser and pulled out the top drawer she peered into it and bit her lip here were more of her clothes socks underwearenough changes for several days all clean and tidy the next drawer contained a couple more tops and another pair of jeans in the bottom drawer was a small collapsible suitcase that she often used on short trips she ran a hand through her hair and tried to thinkwhere was she and why what had she been doing last night she sat on the edge of the bed and thought she looked at the door afraid of going through it until she knew where she was she felt like shed grasp it if she could just focus she had been sitting for a few minutes when she heard a knock at the door she jumped freya the voice was familiar hello she replied i heard you moving around breakfast is ready when you want it it was professor stowe okay thanks she heard footsteps moving away from the door and waited for a few moments something was coming back to her she had been at the old observatory againbut doing what she went to the door and opened it she now stood in a small triangular hallway there were two other doors both open one of which led to the large sitting room that she now remembered from her first night here and the other leading to the kitchen there were pleasant smells and the faint sound of a radio coming from within she edged around the doorway hello said professor stowe at the cooker he was stirring a pan of eggs with a spatula i dont have any appointments this morning so i thought id come over and make breakfast are you feeling better im not sure you push yourself quite hard maybe you should take today to clear your headwalk around a little in any case i hope youll feel better after this theres bacon already on the table have a seat and ill get you some coffee freya sat at a small table with stools arranged around it stowe placed a mug of coffee in front of her and she breathed a lungful of it into her maybe she would take today to relax itd been awhile since shed walked around oxford she gazed into the gently spiraling wisps of steam as they curled into the air trying to remember exactly when she had last seen the city she had walked around with her parents when she first arrived but that seemed like a long time ago she couldnt even remember what term it was now either hilary or trinity right there you are tuck in stowe said placing a hot plate of scrambled eggs in front of her toast yes please she said helping herself to bacon what were you and the lieutenant going over last night um it was deans ancient mechanisms i think thats mechanisms ancient i think youll find cookham dean has an interesting perspectivealthough reading through his prose can be something of a plough these days nonetheless it does bear pearls yes freya said things starting to fall into place now i also took some of dudley ports histories to bed with me but i didnt get very far no i dont imagine you would have he chuckled and then moved forward and took her plate here ill clear up you go get some fresh air brent will pop in around noon feel free to send him away if you need the day off freya looked down at her empty plate she was still hungry thanks she said she went to drain her coffee but found that shed already finished it she found her shoes by the door and went outside she saw a black iron gate that led to a green expanse and she followed that freya walked the circuit of university parks maybe she had been overdoing it lately she really should take the day off to relax shed work better after relaxing then tomorrow she could hit the studies hard again with a fresh mind she sat down on a bench by the duck pond put her head in her hands and started massaging her scalp am i disturbing you freya looked up mr cross was standing in front of her no freya said sitting up straight and trying to put on a smile no not at all felix told me youd be here his voice was abrupt and direct with strong northern inflections would you not feel so ill if we had our session out in the open we could give it a try only it is important mr cross sat beside freya look at those ducks he said the silly buggers where did we leave off it was i think somewhere around eniol i believe cross cleared his throat and began eniol was still young at the time of riniols death and so isfatel was ruler until eniol came of age which was for thirteen years until he was fifty and the ward of the crown was eighteen but when he was fortyeight he became ill and had to share power with the chancellor terenifil who resigned his commission to become ward for the interim years leaving intafel the vicechancellor in his position this was intafel who was istafels illegitimate son by tenil the wife of inhenial who was also of the house nerefon and whose other name was berenon and was the sister of nonibere they were the children of intragon whose name is not known since this name means simply gobetween it could be that this was onterigon who was the third son of birenons grandfather grenithone who was called the father of two houses those being gonteroc and minetoc gonteroc was named for gonithone son of grenithone who had of sons five rentigon mentrigon fanigon vhanthigon and amonigon of daughters there were seven gonterri who married vascan gonshari who married ritiol gonbruni who married rasslon gonfortu who married marthust gonpiriri who married chirithust gonchuri who married jhaltrot and two more whose names have been lost to us freya her attention already drifting felt herself nodding off she shook her head gently from side to side but who married sons from the house ronirocvenron and terron that was house gonteroc house minetoc was named for minethone son of grenithone of that house there were sons four rommin treymin oromin and yummin the names of their spouses are not known but it is recorded that retiniol descendant of oromin was related to entefiol by virtue of marriage to his sister daughters of the house of minetoc were six minnah who married tunnik of artrinon mingrini who married nintner of grentner minotoo who married dasten of rocoone mindher who married eleneth of docrot minetee who married and survived kaejey of trownon to marry lorlok of kolor and minkanti who had no husband those were the houses of the sons of gonteroc and minetoc the patriarchs of which married the two sisters erivah and inilah who had no official royal descent but claimed to be from the line of britune the mythical hero whose exploits are recorded in the comeridion the tales of people of trisk who at that time were ruled by indinah of the house hanoc and so grenithone became beholden to hanzhan by virtue of the marriage of his sons to his daughters onterigon the third son of grenithone became a member of gonithones court and married elewhine freya was now trying very hard to stay awake she had abandoned trying to make sense of crosss list of names and relations and was fighting simply to keep her eyes open if he was indeed the same man as intragon then that means that berenon had strong ties to the house thonetoc through his father and nerefone through his mother it is uncommon that a male son would follow his mother to her family house while his father was still alive before reaching his age of manhood and so it can be assumed that before berenon was of age onterigon or intragon if it was he was already dead this presents problems but has no bearing whatsoever on intefel since it has been established that he was not of inhenial or berenon and therefore not related to the thonetoc line now to return to eniol he ruled for eight months having previously married riwlah of the house of riwetoc who was the daughter of eniriw and she was asleep daniel reached a clearing where several large stones protruded from the ground the sky that was visible through the gaps between the leaves and branches of the trees was still light but it had become very cold in the forest the cloak was keeping him warm enough for now but he would need more than that for the night he had poems to compose in fact hed already come up with a couple verses that werent completely awful with a mixture of anticipation and dread he cleared his throat here goes nothing he thought and spoke in a loud clear voice forest great and forest good may i have some firewood he waited and listened there were no sounds apart from the breeze rattling the branches and rustling the leaves overhead he looked around no pile of firewood had miraculously appeared perhaps he had to search for it or maybe it wasnt a good enough poem or maybe kay was pulling his leg he took off his new cloak and laid it on one of the rocks then careful always to keep a couple of the large rocks in view he started hunting among the underbrush for twigs and branches he didnt have to go far before he had collected an armload of wood some of it small and relatively dry some of it larger about the width of his arm he brought it back to the clearing and dumped it by one of the boulders then he went back out he brought back about a dozen more armfuls making quite a sizeable pile he had no idea how much he was going to need he didnt know how much wood hed need in his own world let alone this one where the days and nights were twice as long an armload might only mean about an hours burning time better have too much than too little he decided and kept going back out for more so long as more was to be had he had made a couple dozen more trips never leaving sight of the boulders until he had gathered a pretty sizeable pile daniel crouched and ran his hand over the ground which was covered with a small amount of semidecayed leaves that created a soft surprisingly dry powdery substance that was good he knew from years of hard experience on the streets that lack of insulation against the ground could freeze you as quickly as the wind looking around he figured he could easily scrape up enough of this dry matter to make workable bedding but now he had to actually make the fire he sucked his breath in and let it out in a sigh he hadnt felt that the success of the firewood poem had been conclusive asking the forest to give him some fire was really going to be the test he started fitting rhymes together in his head as he placed the wood into what he figured was a good pattern then he stood up and dusted off his hands here went nothing kay had told him to ask for fire and this was it he took another deep breath and recited thank you forest great and good for giving me my firewood but in order to survive the night i need this pile of wood to light please give me what i require to make myself a good campfire daniel held his breath and sucked on his lower lip what was he going to do if this didnt work start rubbing sticks together he supposed he had just started to let his breath out in a sigh of defeat when there was a rustling above as of a bird flying through the branches and a whistle of something descending at speed he glanced up just as a stone tore through the leaves above and landed at his feet it struck another rock and created a massive bouquet of sparks that leapt a foot into the air daniel jumped back in alarm looking about him at the tree cover what was this now was the forest trying to kill him blinking in surprise he bent down and examined the object that had fallen it was a wedge of metal iron maybe shaped like an axe head when it fell it had struck a fistsized rock and broken a large chunk of it off looking at the rock closer he found the broken edge glossy and hardflint you must be joking he muttered he bent down and gave the metal and the flint a few experimental knocks together generating more sparks in a few short minutes he found a way to create a good number at once he pulled out some dry brown moss from the woodpile and started striking the rock and the metal above it it took some time but the moss started to curl and then smoke after careful tending a flame appeared which he nursed and fed with more moss he gently pushed it into the centre of the woodpile then placed the piece of metal and stone into his rucksack he kept feeding and nurturing the fire until some of the thicker branches caught and then he sat back and let the fire take its course watching the flames grow and lick against the larger branches he was tired nowincredibly tired whatever there was inside of him that had kept him going was almost completely exhausted he had come a long way since waking up this morning on magdalen bridge he was also hungry unbelievably hungry he took a sip of water from the skin that kay had given him and lay back to think of another poem he looked at the stone that had also been given to him sniffed itit smelled of nothingand slowly stuck it into his mouth it tasted faintly bitterlike just about any other rock he imagined he hadnt habitually tasted rocks since he was about four but this one even after all that time failed to impress it was making his gorge rise he spat the stone into his palm and looked at it again now glinting with saliva then he tipped his hand and let it fall to the ground that was enough of that he turned his attention back to the fire as he sat his ears adjusted to the silence and eventually over the sound of the hissing wood he became aware of another noise with a mighty effort he stood up his muscles already starting to ache and went to investigate the sound led him to a stream nearly a river which was as wide as he was tall he stood for a moment puzzled since he hadnt seen or heard it when he was gathering firewood but there was no doubt about it here it was the water trickled through a maze of rocks and pools at a fair speed as he got closer he noticed something shimmering within the water that flashed with a white silvery brilliance even in the low light stooping over he saw that it wasnt just one object but many similar objects flashing by in the same directionfish there were masses of them swimming past in clumps of dozens he thought for a moment of going back and finding a stick long and pointed enough to make a spear out of but the fish were so thickly packed at the spot he was standing and so close to the surface that he thought he might be able to just reach down and pick them out of the water as easily as plucking apples from a treeripe for the taking he bent over and stretched his arm out ready to dart it into the water and pull out a nice lovely fish but suddenly pulled his arm back ripe for the taking he had almost taken a fish from the stream a fish he hadnt asked for from a stream he hadnt asked the forest to show him he drew himself back and sat on his feet his heart was racing he was almost gasping at his near miss but then how near of a miss had it actually been the only reason he had to believe that there was any danger to him if he took things without asking was kays word a manan elfthat he had never met before a short time ago it could very easily be he was being lied to if not ridiculed that said the piece of metal from the sky was a bit of a stretch to the notion of coincidence daniel sighed and then thought for a moment then good forest please now i wish that you would give to me a fish even by his own standards daniel knew that it was a pretty lousy poem but he was tired and hungry and more than a little confused there was a splashing sound and a fish leapt out of the water flipping end over end and landed on the bank next to him where it floundered halfheartedly it was almost a foot long daniel didnt know much about fishing but he knew enough to grab the fish by its tail and smack its head against a rock to kill it he did so and sat for a moment holding it he thought of another rhyme forest i dont wish to be greedy but i am hungry cold and needy id like some fish a couple more delivered to me like before daniel couldnt tell if his poetry was good or not hed have to try to come up with something better tomorrow for the path there was another splash and two more fish flopped out onto the ground beside him shaking his head he killed them and then scooped up all three fish and walked back up to his camp where the fire needed tending he did this raking the new coals together and got it all burning at a steady clip he spitted the fish set them to cook lengthways against the fire and started scraping up enough dead leaves for bedding the birds in the branches above him started to twitter as if commentating and arguing about the scene below them daniels head swam with ideas and thoughts about the world he now found himself in he was extremely tired though and before he fell asleep he had been contemplating the serious and disturbing idea that the forest may be trying to deliberately trap him the kirk was a small stone building rectangular and grey there was no belfry or steeple just an iron cross on the east end of the roof rab duthie led officer alex simpson through the large wooden door beneath a carved wooden emblem of a burning bush and the cross of st andrew outside the sky was grey and cold but inside the church it was warm and bright the lights and heater were on and candles had been placed on the altar the windowsills in freestanding holdersanywhere there was space for them there were about half a dozen people spread throughout the church sitting in the pews their heads bowed some of them clutching their hands some of them reading silently from bibles a man dressed in black walked towards them down the centre aisle he had a head of wellcombed irongrey hair and a cleanshaven chin when he spoke his voice was soft with a very thin edinburgh accent he greeted rab first shaking his hand in both of his and then turned to alex reverend this is a man from the constabularysays hes looking into theour troubles here is that so he said turning a weary smile to alex and offering a hand alex took it and introduced himself rector john maccanish the reverend introduced himself how do you do how can i assist you well rab said it best said alex ive heard about the trials yeve been facing up here and ive come to help of course help with what exactly alex gazed out into the church yeve got a fair few in today latemorning prayer meeting its maccanish seemed to wrestle with how much to say ive organized a few weeks of twentyfourhour prayer its been a hard time for the parishioners up here rab was telling me about that there are the things that have been told to the policethe thieving the vandalism the suicides and then there are the things you dont tell the policethe accidents the fighting the drinking the victimising the bad crops sickly animals new mothers miscarrying and then there are the things that you dont tell each other alex turned his eye to maccanish the nightmares the screams you think you hear in the night the sleeplessness the foul looks that you imagine people are giving you in the street the curl of your own lip and the shortness of your temper to everyone you meet ill will the sense that theres a thick oppressive force covering the valeas heavy and as dark as a wet woolen blanketsmothering the very life from you from the loved ones around you maccanish stood staring at alex blinking his eyes and youre with the police he asked aye the police alex gave another grin well youre absolutely right about all of thatdreams cries in the night and the rest except for the part about no one telling each otherthey tell me all of them everybody feels it and they come here in their minds the church is here to prevent all evil touching themso they can just ignore it and get on with their lives whether they step in the building or not when that is found not to be the casewell then its the kirks fault for letting it happen isnt it they come here angry you understand lividdemanding answers explanations ive got none for them they dont prepare you for this type of thing in the seminary ive been threatened officer maccanish said holding out his hands attacked not by men by womenmothers in desperation they want to know what to do and what can i tell them itll be alright in the end no i say watch and pray read your scripture search your hearts and meditate on the word and they leave here angrier than they arrivedspitting cursing blaspheming all manner of obscenities and where do i turn i called the bishops but they just fobbed me off i wanted them to come up and seefeel what its like to walk down these paths and they agreed but their secretaries refused to make appointments weve been abandoned all of us wed abandon each other if we could maccanish ran his hands through his hair and composed himself then he continued i had a sitdown with the wife to work out what to do we prayed long and hard we listened for the spirit to guide us and you know what we heard him say watch and pray it was the hardest thing to hear at that time but we set our shoulders to the task john my wife said john go down to the kirk with this load of candles get down on your knees and ill bring a pot of tea around directly i came down to open the kirk and i found three elderly ladiesparishionersstanding on the doorstep i asked them what they were doing here and they said that theyd come to help me watch and pray i nearly bawled like a bairn i was so relieved that was over a fortnight ago and ive rarely left the building since its turned the church right upside down over twothirds of my congregation has abandoned the buildingwont even come in sight of the place i go to visit them and their doors are barred but there are those who previously wouldnt nod to me in the street turning up every day sitting and praying for hours on end but praying for what watching for what for me alex said solemnly for me reverend maccanish youre in the middle of a spiritual battle youve been invaded and being taken offguard and illprepared the only thing you could do was dig in keep your heads down and wait for reinforcement a spiritual battle maccanish repeated his eyes shining he began nodding his head ayeaye so what are you are you the reinforcement are you likea spiritual general or something he asked eagerly me said alex a general no im not a general he paused for dramatic effecthe couldnt help himself im black ops chapter eight the lifiendes before the yfelgop laid perfectly still in a pool of its own blood as soon as daniel and freya felt able they stood up brushed themselves off and then very cautiously opened the door and crept back downstairs modwyn was standing in the hall talking to frithfroth and two guards in an urgent and frantic manner she looked up as daniel and freya descended and cried out there they are all eyes turned up to them they saw freya holding the yfelgop spear saw the dark blood on daniels shirt and his own blood dripping from his hand to the stone floor and gave a gasp of horror modwyn rushed forward arms outstretched oh my dear children where were you what happened to you daniel and freya felt hands on them searching them for injuries they heard questions that came so fast they could not answer them they tried their best to give a short explanation of what had just happened frithfroth modwyn called when they told her of the attack tell the guard to sweep the tower the lifiendes have been attacked she turned back to them and examined the cuts on daniels face drawing herself up she turned to cnafa and cnapa lead these two to the kitchens she instructed then bring hot water poultice and bindings daniel and freya allowed themselves to be led through the silent hall the kitchen was a cold room with a high ceiling there were several large ovens that looked very dusty and long stonetopped metal tables that did not appear to have been used recently two metal stools were dragged before them and they sat down gratefully cnapa placed a bowl of water and a cloth before him modwyn entered and hurried over to them kneeling before daniel and freya her green dresses flowing out around her she cleaned daniels wounds as they explained what happened in more detail my poor elingas she said when they had finished i was so worried when i did not see you with the others daniels wound had been cleaned of blood these are not deep they will not scar modwyn cleaned the cloth in the bowl and pushed it away the bell will sound again when the geard is cleared she said until then you must stay in the hall i must go and find news of the battle i will send cnafa and cnapa to bring you some food i will return shortly with that and a sweep of her long gown she left them daniel and freya went back into the main hallway and found a bench out of the way of the terrified niergearders in a few moments cnafa brought them a tealike spiced drink and cnapa brought them some more of the flatbread and dried meat they sat sipping at the drink from warm clay bowls and chewing very small mouthfuls of food which they did not taste as they ate they noticed the townspeople watching them they wouldnt say anything to each other just stared and looked away whenever daniel or freya made eye contact after a time they heard the tolling of a bell modwyn entered the hall again the attack is over she announced the streets are clear but be cautious in returning to your homes do not go alone she stepped aside to allow the people out of the hall and made her way to daniel and freya come with me she said they left the langtorr by the large double doors once outside she asked a guard at the gate whose arms and chest were covered with putrefying brown blood where the main force was gathered he had an odd look on his facea kind of dazed unbelieving look he pointed with a wavering hand towards one end of the city overover there is all well modwyn asked the guard we were told that the city was clear and so have i been told idesweard and so it seems the guard replied but for my life i know not why what mean you by that the guard paused seemed to choke slightly and then continued weakly the wall has been breached yes of course we know nay niercwen not just the defenses but the wall itself has been broken modwyns eyes widened where the guard could only gesture weakly her eyes blazing modwyn spun on her heel and started off in the direction he had pointed come lifiendes she said hurry they rushed through the streets of the underground city alongside modwyn passing people returning to their homes and assessing damages everywhere they lookedalongside walls and heaped in the middle of the streetslay bodies of yfelgopes nearly all of them headless daniel wondered why this was but soon saw that groups of knights and guards were systematically gathering corpses together and chopping the heads from the dead enemies bodies he shuddered and looked away rounding a corner they saw the city wall with its massive carved trees rise up in front of thembut it wasnt as it had been a large ushaped section had crumbled away creating an avalanche of stone that engulfed the nearby houses modwyn gave a startled cry when she saw the gap and ran towards it there were many guards standing in the breach their shoulders tense and weapons ready swigar and ecgbryt were there perched on a pile of dusty stones gazing out into the blackness cautious and tense the wall looked as if it had just fallen apart like the wall of a sand castle they were still a fair distance away when they came to the first bits of rubble from the wall blocks of stone had fallen against some of the houses piling like a grey drift of snow as they started to climb the pile they were surprised to find that the rocks crumbled to a fine powder underfootit was like walking up a snow bank daniel knelt down and picked up a large clump of painted ivy he was able to lift it quite easily it was brittle and he found he could flake pieces away with his thumb the sensation was like holding a compressed brick of fine sand as they neared the peak of the dusty heap they became aware of a rhythmic pounding sound dull soft and strong like the pounding of blood modwyn and freya climbed up to stand behind swigar and ecgbryt what is it asked freya whats that sound it is the gopes stated swigar they are letting us know that they bide they all stood and listened to the pounding pounding pounding of thousands of hands against the dirta steady synchronized patient beat why arent they attacking daniel asked swigar pointed into the darkness standing at the edge of the circle of light thrown by the citys lanterns was a dim reddish figure pacing back and forth just in front of the gap in the wall whos that he asked it is ealdstan said ecgbryt ealdstan but freya remembered the figure falling out of the window as they raced to the langtorr she had forgotten about it until just now but remembered the fall replayed in her head the swirling robes riffling like a falling flame ealdstan must have more power in him than he had given them reason to believe the swaggering figure striding up and down the battle line in front of the haunting pounding rhythm of the yfelgopes didnt act like the old man daniel and freya had met he was strong and spry something about the way he held himself made him seem haughtychallenging ealdstan turned and strode back the other way his chest thrown forward daring anyone to engage him none did ealdstan made another pass and then spun on his heel and walked back towards the city daniel and freya shied away slightly as ealdstan approached the group freya still had a bruise on her arm where ealdstan had gripped her and neither she nor daniel had particularly wanted to see him again ealdstan stood for a while staring into the city at the ruins of the wall and the bodies of the yfelgopes lost in his own thoughts until modwyn addressed him what is it that could accomplish this she said raising a hand to indicate the wreckage gad did this it is a spell of decay a magic to corrupt solid rock he must have been weaving it for some time he would have had to build an entropic force and then push it along an enchanted wind the spell would have looked like a black cloud it blew centuries away from the stone in seconds and then nested inside of it it is in it now slowly eating away at it our first greatest defense at his words a chunk of stone the size of a small shed tumbled down from the top of the wall and crumbled into a mound of dust meotodes meahte exclaimed ecgbryt how can it be stopped ealdstan sighed like a professor answering an obvious question it cannot be stoppednot completely i can slow it with my power but it will not quit until gads life leaves himat which time all spells that he has made will unravel it cannot be doubted that he will strike again he continued this is only one move in a game that he and i have begun to play there is no question that he has more schemes in mind some of which are this very moment being put into effect he must be stopped and destroyed said swigar the other knights must be roused rumbled godmund tramping up the pile of rubble to join them they will arrive from all the corners of england and send the yfelhost into oblivion no moaned ealdstan not those sleeping not yet it is not their time what then modwyn exclaimed passionately daniel and freya glanced up at her and saw a face as harsh as a thunderstorm a wall has been breached she rasped that has never failed since it was made over twelve hundred years ago enemies have had their way with the city for the first time in a thousand there were yfelmen in the torr ealdstanone of them attacked the lifiendes if you were to act twould best be done soon and best be done well ealdstan stood motionless as the silence left by the end of modwyns rebuke hung in the air eventually the old wizard said gad will not be defeated easily he will not die by spearthrust or axeblow for his life is no longer in his body he has hidden his mortality somewhere elsesomewhere safe somewhere unknown to anyone only if that mortality can be found and destroyed will gad will be vulnerable to attack the company took this in what do you mean his mortality daniel asked his life ealdstan answered his hearts soul it is an object of hisa hand or a finger perhaps his very heartinto which he has placed his mortal life and then removed from himself as long as it is safe and secret none can touch it how will it be guarded ecgbryt asked it will not be guarded ealdstan replied at least not by any guard aware of his purpose there may be obstacles but gad would rely more on secrecy than force no not guardedhidden i do not understand said godmund how would he be terrified of his own weakness if he were to lose his power ealdstan explained he would still want to reclaim his life and use it the hiding place would be near but still forgotten as ealdstan talked his eyes and voice drifted off he would have placed it on the other side of the wild caves on the other side of the slpismere the slaypismere daniel said under his breath it means the sleeping ocean it is the name we give to the enormous lake of water that lies beneath this island then it is clear said swigar we gather a party and make a sally out to destroy this mortal heart what could be more plain even so growled godmund lowly even were the gristgrenner killed there would still be his general kelm to settle with and the only thing that can defeat the kafhand is force of arms whence is that to come there was silence ealdstan stood muttering not the sleepers not now not yet but with the enchanter said ecgbryt after a short silence surely there is no reason to dither we must destroy gad come what may and it would best be done as soon as possible it is dangerous breathed ealdstan i am the fiend of danger no you understand not gads heart can only be destroyed by a mortal not by a sleeper not by anyone who is now dwelling within niergeard it must be destroyed by a lifiende slowly all eyes turned to settle on daniel and freya i dont understand freya said what does that mean dense children ealdstan sneered it means that none in this city can destroy himexcept one of you you really want to leave this place then destroy gad and break the siege either that or grow old down here with the rest of us in the silence that followed the wizard ealdstan stalked away modwyn led them into a room on the sixth floor of the langtorr high enough above the rooftops of the buildings for them to see the ruined section of wall and the work that was already being done to repair it craftsmen from every corner of the city were coming to join the emergency workforce working quickly faces gaunt stone was hauled from storage by huge workhorses rolled across the city on metal poles and lashed to the backs of the impressive animals the old crumbling rock was being chipped away carved out so that the new stone would fill the gap precisely it nearly broke daniels heart to see any of that beautiful forestlike wall fall away however necessary why arent the yfelgopes attacking daniel asked staring down from the window onto the work wouldnt they beat us all if they did i do not know said modwyn after a pause their minds are so twisted that i cannot guess they have always plagued us but i have never known them to be organized thus i fear their leader gad yes and also this kelm he is not an yfelgop i wist but something moresomething older and cleverer i dont understand why hasnt this been dealt with ages ago when you first saw the yfelgopes daniel asked modwyn sighed ealdstan prevented ithe reasoned that niergeard is of little consequence in the face of the battle that is to come what battle is that daniel asked just one battle in the long war that has been raging across the universe since near time began the war between creation and destruction ealdstan has cast his sight forward and seen great forces clashing upon this island although of great consequence to us this land is just a small pebble in the vast arena and this glorious city no more than a grain of sand but if niergeard is threatened reasoned daniel that means the knights are threatened and that means that the country is in danger not necessarily daniel and freya gazed blankly at modwyn but said freya if protecting this city will help to win the battleand then each battle afterwardswhy not do it niergeard may be a pebble but if it falls it could start an avalanche there are many ways of winning a battle modwyn said quietly and unconvincingly what you must understand about niergeard she continued after a moments thought is that nothing changes hereits not intended to that is the enchantments purpose it is the price we pay when we give up our mortality because our lives have no end nothing we do can have an end we must always look after the knights we must always be opposed by the forces of destruction and decay and we must always keep fighting against the opposition whatever form it may take though that fight has no end thatsthats terrible freya said to keep doing the same things over and over again is that why everyone looks so worn out daniel asked so tired so grey modwyn nodded it is our sacrifice it is the nature of things to gain a gift we must relinquish a gift what gift did you have to lose we had to lose the gift of deaththe gift of completion the door between life and death must always be open for us but we may never walk through it nor cause others to pass through it we cannot affect anything completely neither start nor finish a significant act such as to create life share love or or even destroy an enemy we must continue unchanged and unchanging until our purpose is finished but you can kill the yfelgopes they exist on a plane much like ours their curse their sacrifice is living a halflife never fully alive we can kill them individually though not as a whole neither their source nor their master may be destroyed by us we may operate within cycles and affect their course by degrees but we cannot end or create them we may alter the balance but not overturn itfor our lives are thin but whats the point of even being here if you cant change anything we do not exist to win the battle you understandthat task has been given to others we exist to support those who fight you mean the sleeping knights modwyn nodded so what are the knights waiting for daniel asked after a time why are they asleep modwyn drew a deep breath they await one of two things either for this islands enemies to invade it at which time the knights will wake and drive the attackers into the sea or they wait for the battle at the end of time when they will rise up with all sleepers everywhere and fight for creation how long until then modwyns clasped hands started to fidget she looked away from them and smiled coldly to herself to speak truly we did not dream the wait would be this long when the first knights were laid down it was thought a hundred years perhaps longer but never more than a thousand they sat in silence daniel broke it by slowly saying but britain has been under attack lots of times have you ever risen up and helped anyone then modwyn looked up at him and her smile seemed to warm britain has warred many times occasionally with itself and often with its neighbors but its people have not yet been in the direst of danger in peril of the death of their souls rulers come and rulers gothe normans the saxons and jutes the angles the romans the celts the picts and the hidden races before themand rule of the island is passed from one set of hands to another but the spirit of the isle remains strong and soon it is the island that conquers the conquerors its ways become their ways its loves become their loves in time they fight for it and its people as fervently as those whom they replaced so england hasnt been in enough danger yet asked freya is that what youre saying there have been timesas in the period now referred to as the dark agesin which evil spirits began to manifest themselves physically taking on twisted forms to enslave and destroy the people of this isleflying creatures ravaged the skies chilling the hearts of the people and any manner of striding beasts stalked the forests it was thought that the time of the greatest threat was near and so many knights were awakened to join the living heroes who rose at that time to fight them off you meandragons daniel asked amazed yes it was the hardest task of all to rid the island of its dragons there were some that had gained a firm hold they are devious creaturesmore cunning than men with souls as cold and powerful as glaciers they feed on fear and terror and are never wholly out of the hearts of men but they were not the only foes there were others more monsters modwyn drew in a breath yes of many various kinds those of the mischievous varietywisps brownies kobolds hobgoblins and ghoulsas well as the larger typesogres trolls and changelings all of these have been exiled to the lower parts of the world where it is hot and watch is kept on their doorways for if once a foothold is gained by that world in this then the two start mixing babies are stolen to become elf princes those who would be witches and warlocks sell their souls for power men are knitted into werecreatures and it is harder to separate the undead darkness from the world that was how the elvesthe hidden peoplebecame corrupted it was very hard to force them out of the land and you said that the knights woke up to help the heroes of that time right said freya as she started to make sense of this fantastic information yes said modwyn so you always needed living heroes because mortal people are the only ones who can destroy evil and put an end to the cycles said freya well said modwyn nodded it is just so and right now asked daniel are we the heroes they cant destroy gad or the yfelgopes said freya gazing levelly at modwyn but we can because were mortal modwyn nodded again because we can die daniel added that is right said modwyn softly if gad is getting more and more powerful daniel continued after another thoughtful pause and the yfelgopes are getting to be more and more then doesnt that mean eventually that all the monsters will come back it will mean that said modwyn if we dont find a way of stopping him the tides of darkness continually wax and wane and we are in the middle of a strong flow at the moment for years evil has been building and gathering on these shores but that question doesnt rest on us below it rests on the state of the souls of those above if things get worseif events occur as ealdstan predicts then we may yet see monsters again on the island of the mighty we wait and watch it is what we do it is what we have always done but dont look so sad children modwyn said with a genuine smile the battle against darkness is not our battle alone whether that darkness be within him or without it is a war that man has fought since first he awoke it is the most sublime battle in the universe and it brings freedom to whoever fights in it to whatever effect although our suffering may be greater than anothers so also is our blow against the opposer and our victory and reward the sweeter for this reason we were placed in this life to fight and we are fighting as best we can it may be dark now and it may be darker henceforth our strength may leave us but what we achieve will not be insignificant and it will not be unnoticed the greater the toil in our agony the greater our glory at the last daniel and freya sat still hardly breathing they knew that something was expected of themsome sort of commitment or responsebut it meant that they would be in danger of pain and death and everything in between neither of them could bring themselves to speak modwyn herself seemed to be pressing them to say what they knew they had to say but still they said nothing terrified come with me she said rising with stately grace there is something else you should see they ascended the stairs again and went higher up the tower than they had yet gone she made several halting pauses as if she didnt completely remember where she was going finally the three came to a metal door that modwyn opened by turning a large wheel in its centre like a submarine hatch freya thought this rather odd and out of place but had only a couple of seconds to wonder at it before she saw what was on the other side of the door they gasped the room which was as big as freyas bedroom was filled with modern machinery at least it seemed modern in comparison to everything else in niergeard it was more like the sort of technology in old science fiction tv showslarge metal banks and cabinets with dials and switches on themdials and switches like those in world war ii bombers there was an ornate wroughtiron chair of typical niergeard design at a small desk that held a pair of massive headphones that were connected to the bank by a dangling decaying coiled cord what is it freya asked modwyn our radio modwyn replied frankly ealdstan brought a man in to make it almost a hundred years ago our blacksmiths and craftsmen made each piece that he needed to his specifications ealdstan said that it would be very useful and it has been in the past but its been some time since weve had any need to come in here she walked over to a large wheel that jutted out from the wall opposite the headphones it was solid metal about two feet wide and two inches thick modwyn gripped it by its edges and put her whole weight and strength into turning it it moved slowly and continued turning when she let go a red lightbulb above it glowed on do you still use radios where you live modwyn asked they both nodded modwyn flipped a large switch that fell into place with a thunk there was a popping sound and then a hum filled the room as long as the wheel is turning the radio will work if the wheel stops then give it another turn she disconnected the headphones from the machine and a static susurrus filled the air she went over to a large dial that had many numbers and radial lines on it turn this to hear different reports and sounds with more difficulty than freya or daniel would have had she found a station broadcasting an interview show you may listen as long as you like if you need something come and see me or frithfroth or cnafa and cnapa she went to the door and turned to them before she left and said destruction and evil is spreading in this world listen for yourself they sat for some time listening to the soothing voices on the radio spar snidely about the current conflict in palestine as it related to a book that one of them had written shortly after that came the bbc radio call signal and a political debate show that discussed the proper response towards a certain african despot daniel stood up just as the discussion opened to include a south american dictator and turned the large dial to a music station then he gave the large flywheel a little more momentum and sat back down next to freya they listened to songs number nine to five on a stations pop music countdown and then the playlist broke for a news roundup there were four items there was the african dictator again a young boy who had been stabbed in london the previous night a body count of people who had been crushed to death in a religious ceremony in india and a car bomb that had gone off in a british embassy in a country they knew of but couldnt place the threeandahalfminute segment ended with the prime minister announcing that the army which was occupying that country already had suspects in hand and a very hard line would be taken with them and those in the area to ensure that such events do not happen again then there were some commercials they finished out listening to the top pop songs countdown and freya got up to turn the dial just as the news program started to repeat they didnt know how many hours they sat listening perhaps it was a full day it was both comforting and disturbing to listen to the radio comforting because it was familiar and reminded them of home but disturbing because they couldnt deny what modwyn had said a lot of bad things were happening in the world some of them seemed smallthe shootings kidnappings and murders compared to the larger events like wars riots and racial killings on a national scale do you think it was always that way freya asked i dont know but its that way now it seems like a lot of these things are really big problems were there always rulers who killed lots of people and wars must have been daniel said but that doesnt mean that what modwyn says is wrong but it doesnt make it true either she could have planned all this planned what news reports on the bbc even if she could why why would she or they need to trick us why would they want us to do this quest who knows daniel thought some more as classical music played on the radio well even assuming the worst i dont see how were going to get out of it either we go on this quest to destroy gads heart or what we stay here forever youd like that wouldnt you daniel thought for a moment i feel like i fit in here he said eventually in a low voice almost surprised at his own honesty you fit in here more than the place you grew up inwhere you were born is school really that bad you have no idea how much i hate school and its not just that its everywhere even in my own home im ignored or in the way at least here people pay attention to me you know swigar and ecgbryt and modwyneven ealdstanits like we matter here if we did this wed really make a difference you dont think you matter in the real world do you he shot back sorry of course you do he continued sarcastically you come from a welloff family in a nice area who has a lot of stuff and parents who like you and give you hugs and presents and cake shut up freya said angrily daniel didnt dare look at her but knew that she was glaring at him fiercely he played with the straps on his shoes instead what if i do have all those things i dont but so what if i did its not my fault is it i didnt choose my family or where i got born so im not going to apologise am i anyway im not making you poor or lonely or messing up your relationship with your parents what parents daniel murmured an uncomfortable lump in his throat weve known each other since before primary school ive been around your place but why do you think i never invited you around mine the last memory i have of my dad is him shouting at my nan he left me with a mum who sleeps all day goes clubbing every night and is always ratarsed wherever she is there was a pause ratarsed freya asked for some reason this struck her as funny she couldnt stop a giggling snort from escaping her what asked daniel peevishly but he was smiling too im sorry freya gave another little laugh daniel grinned a little wider its not funny he said still trying to be mad but failing its really not no i know its just she laughed again and daniel joined her what are we going to do freya asked once they had stopped laughing i dont see what option we have destroy the evil wizard lets do it this sounds important its an adventure freya said smiling a onceinalifetime experience at least i hope it is daniel gave freya a smile back and they rose together to find modwyn we want to help freya announced when they found her were going to help you destroy gad and we want weapons daniel added ecgbryt passed his torch to freya before throwing his weight on a huge iron latch set into a tall stone door he rattled some other levers then leaned back on an iron ring slowly setting the door in motion daniel and freya took several steps back as it ponderously swung towards them this was the armoury and it was meant to be hard to get into a tide of musty air swept over them making the torch flicker as ecgbryt took hold of it again he led them inside and daniel and freya marveled as the torchlight was reflected and refracted from thousands of shining surfaces the deep room was filled with shelves racks and stands containing swords shields spears helmets and various parts and types of armour to be on a warriors quest explained ecgbryt cheerily as he led them through the weapon hall means to be in part a warrior and to be a warrior means in part to carry a weapon for that purpose we are here they walked past shelves of helmets that ranged from simple half spheres of metal to those with noseguards and neck protectors to those with face deflectors to those with moveable visors on the other side of the aisle were racks of axes some of them like ecgbryts with straight edges some of them with curved single edges some of them with two curved edges some of them small as long as his own armand some on thick poles much taller than he was it was like being in a museum but the artifacts were not behind glass nor were they old and rusted all of them looked well polished well oiled very strong and often very very sharp are any of them magical daniel asked or enchanted enchanted nay said ecgbryt with an emphatic shake of his head at least he said and paused a disturbed expression flicking across his face i hope they arent no no one would dare butbut wouldnt that be best at least for us freya asked ecgbryt frowned and shrugged i dont believe so theres nothing better than a solid piece of steel strongly wrought and well crafted thats as strong an enchantment as you will ever want in any battlefieldmore reliable as well most hero feats were completed with a decent slice of metal and a bold heart it is unwise to trust enchantmentsthey often let you down when you need them most ecgbryt stopped at a rack and ran his finger along a row of sheathed knives and daggers ah these will do he said picking out two of them here he said passing them along take one each a good knife is essential on any journey they were small blades comparatively speaking only about the length of a hand with snug leather sheaths bone handles and stout metal hand guards i will not deny said ecgbryt as he continued down the hall that one may hear of an enchanted blade lending strength to an already strong warrior from time to time but that warrior still must move it some blades of renown are even named and are famous for their names even so can you name any blade more famous than the warrior who lofted it for what is the use of any object hallowed though it may be without a strong hand to lift it it would be like a horse with no riderit serves nothing higher than its own purpose here we are they stopped in front of a line of spears bundled upright along the back wall ecgbryt pulled a couple apart twice as high as either of his companions and hefted them in his hand i dont suppose either of you has started practicing combat yet the large knight asked of course not said freya pity that will make it harder to choose the right form of weapon however youve killed an yfelgop between you with very little at hand and thats not a small thing i have seen the body and recognised a masterly killing stroke he gave freya a sly glance certain are you that youve never used a spear he asked again no replied freya exasperated well i threw javelin at school a few times she was good daniel said javelin is it ecgbryt grinned then the choice is clear i shall start you on your height and a quarter he walked down the line a distance until he came to some irregular spears of different lengths he sorted through them briefly and then uttered an exclamation aha the very thing he held before freya a slim white piece of wood as tall as she was it was lengthened by a metal shaft about a foot long and topped with a diamondshaped tip not quite a javelin but still it is of roman design ecgbryt told her the romansor those we used to call the laedenware developed spearcraft to a brilliant form and it will serve you well the shaft is ash naturally the tip tempered iron it has good balance and this is how you can tell he cradled the spear at both ends of the wooden shaft between his thumb and forefinger he then slowly brought his hands together the point at which the hands meet is the centre right here he circled his hand around the spot and then passed it to her hold it heft it for yourself freya reluctantly took the weapon from him it was heavier than she expected she found its centre for herself that is the point at which you would grip it ecgbryt said if you were to hurl it at an enemy the laedenes were keen on such tactics but i would not advise anyone to throw away a weapon in the normal course of combat it leaves one short armed and usually gives an opponent the advantage of in this case a wellbalanced spear its tip is designed to pierce armour and yet come out again easily freya regarded the spear she held in her hand with a doubtful expression no thanks she said handing the spear back to ecgbryt ecgbryt didnt take it i donti wouldnt feel comfortable taking it i dont know how to use it andso anyway thanks she pushed the spear at him again ecgbryt took it but did not return it to the ranks he held it lightly absentmindedly between his fingers and thumb he shrugged and turned to daniel raising his eyebrows and now young daniel we come to you you defended yourself well with a poker did you not how did you find it daniel squirmed uneasily i dont know it was difficult ecgbryt nodded patiently aye also frustrating daniel added because i couldnt hurt him with it i could only defend myself and it was hard to move heavy ecgbryt smoothed his beard braids yes a mace or warhammer would take much strength that would be difficult for you to musteralthough you managed to wield it quite swiftly against a knife perhaps something to grow into turning he said i have an idea which may be better wait ecgbryt freya blurted wait a second ecgbryt turned to her all this fighting all these weaponsare you sure this is the right thing to do ecgbryts face appeared blank in the torchlight i mean isnt there a peaceful way to do this without you know killing things it might have been different in your time but these days people like to talk about peaceful freyas voice trailed off as ecgbryt crouched down in front of her his eyes looking earnestly into hers he knelt on one knee and squared an elbow on the other bless you for saying that he said in a low voice bless you his eyes lost focus his gaze drifting behind her beyond the walls of the room in my time he started and then stopped he swallowed looking down at the floor his eyes came back up and they were steady and firm i grew up in the west lands of south britonthe kingdom of sussex since before i was born the dane men had been making raids upon the northern kingdoms of the isle in their long boats they would merrily leave their homes waving goodbye to their wives and children as if going on a hunting party when they arrived after working themselves into a battleblindness upon the waves they would kill another mans wife and another mans children for the gain of his pantry sacking churches monasteries feast halls as i grew they became bolder going so far as to settle the land they were continually attacking in order to more efficiently ravage the south lands there was no telling when they might strike or where one summer the village next to ours was hit everyone was killedeveryone lads i had known since before memory were hewn in two like saplings and men gutted like pigs the noble men and women were bound and taken away to be ransomed it was then that lfred the geatolic arose to defy the invaders he was an honourable man as bold as he was wise as loving as he was fierce and he was canny oh so canny but he was not jealous of his intelligence for he built up mens minds and souls as he built his fleet always strengthening and improving in this way he was able to rally and unite the kingdoms of the realm and to continually press the danes and harry them as never before swa swa he continued with a sigh there was much fighting much blood terrible hardships their king guthrum the battle wyrm was wily and deceitful and despite lfreds tenacity there looked to be times when we would not win through but at ethandun we did it was a day lived in hell by every man there we fought from dawn until dusk bitter hard with watering eyes and grinding teeth and we beat them back all of them to their burgh in readinga come fortnight they surrendered and lfred instead of killing the invading king as an example for all other wouldbe attackers forgave him schooled him in the way of the cross and stood father to him in the church as the heathen dane had his soul washed i was there and near wept like a babe war is only barbaric when fought by barbarians dishonourable when fought by those with no honour we did not fight for gain ambition our right or even justice in those days to revenge ourselves on the dane would have forced us into atrocities as great as they raised against us and made our souls as dark we fought for peace for every mans peaceincluding those who opposed us and our actions bear us out for they were allowed to reside on the island from that day forth so long as they lived in peace was there ever such fruit of war as that perhaps you have seen such i pray you have for i would pity you if you have not that is why i fight now for peace and i will fight until the end of time to win it he tilted the spear still in his hand at freya but she refused it again ecgbryt turned to daniel i want a sword daniel said smiling a long one i think the blacksmith staggered into his workshop exhausted from hewing stones he felt the uncommon chill of the room caused by the forge having grown cold while he had been helping to repair the wall moving to the fire pit he stirred the embers with an unfinished sword shaft and shoveled in a couple scoops of coal this was no enchanted fire but one that needed constant attention right now he needed it to be hota working flame in a small handcart by the door he had chisels and picks that needed to be sharpened and tempered for work on the repairs as he watched the new coal catch he became aware of a shuffling behind him he expected his assistant and was about to berate him for letting the fire burn so low when he saw the shape in the doorway turning fully he saw one of the lifiendes the boyclutching a sword in his hands clearing his throat he gruffly asked the lad his business the boy held up his weapon and mumbled something he asked the boy to speak up iive seen some of the knights swords have got writing on them he stammered could you do that for me the blacksmith said that he could id like to have my name on this sword in the same writing as theirs the blacksmith huffed and stepped towards him taking the sword from his hands he turned it over and recognised the work and style he tapped the steel with a hammer and listened for its hardness it was a soft blade and he told the boy so he saw the young ones face fall and hastened to explain that this blades edge was as sharp as any hard blades edge but had less chance of shattering than a hard one it would serve him well provided he didnt use it to fence with rocks as to the name he replied that it could be easily done but why should it be done the boy said softly because im going on a dangerous mission and i might not come back and if someone finds my sword i want them to know that it was mine and that i tried the blacksmith smoothed his beard and nodded as he turned his broad back he rooted around on a high shelf and found a scrap of parchment he laid it in front of the boy and gave him a stick of charcoal instructing him to write his name in plain letters as he wanted it to appear on the blade as he waited he noticed the childs thin legs weak arms and small chest his mind went back to a time when children were not an unfamiliar sight even in his own house he thought how unsuited this child was to a sword of any type was he raised with an illness or just born small and thin perhaps all children looked this way now or perhaps they always had and hed forgotten the boy finished and straightened himself placing the charcoal flat on the table he scratched away for a few moments and then looked up id like a name for it what are some good sword names the smith shrugged and gave him somemany famous others not so gradually they came to an agreement about what the swords name should be and the blacksmith instructed the boy that the work would be sent to the langtorr in due time the boy thanked him and then left the blacksmith returned to his forge heaped more coal into the fire pit and started working the bellows preparations for the departure were almost finished the group would be swigar ecgbryt daniel and freya for a time it looked as if godmund would come with themhe would certainly have been appreciatedbut it was decided that his skills would be needed defending niergeard if there was another assault so while supplies were being gathered ecgbryt took it upon himself to teach daniel the principles of armed combat freya watched and after a while decided to take part as wellshe figured it would be easier to stay out of the way of someone elses weapon if she knew how theyd use it the lessons involved far more talking and explanation than daniel thought necessary followed by an almost mindless repetition of motionsword thrusts and jabs by him and parries and blocks by freya this was done ecgbryt said in order that the most basic strokes and motions of their weapons became as natural to their bodies as breathing they became tired very quickly daniel was sweating heavily and freyas arms felt as if they were going to fall off she found it hard to catch her breath they went back to their rooms for a short rest and a wash in the shallow bowls on their tables daniel lay down on the bed and let himself drift off when he woke up he knocked on freyas door but there was no answer he wandered outside as he approached the stone benchtheir stone benchthat gave the best secluded view of the wall repairs he found freya already there he smiled as soon as he saw her she had her wooden practice spear resting next to her and was wearing a dressone of the oldstyle gowns that had been provided for her it was elaborately embroidered but of a simple design the cloth and pattern were similar to his own shirt but hers was a deep brickred colour i like it he said smoothing some of the folds of her skirt she gave a selfconscious smile thanks my school clothes were getting really tatty and with those traveling cloaks they made for us i thought why not it looks goodthe dark red works on you its nice thanks daniel nodded and took a seat next to her his eyes on the reparations to the wall the workers were starting to fill the gap with new cut stone and had moved large iron pulleys and winches onto the battlements to lift the heavy blocks i really dont want to go on this mission freya said how did i guess well probably get killed if we go well probably get killed if we stay its damned if you do damned if you dont thats what my dad says sometimes daniel smiled and picked up a few pebbles from the ground i think id rather die doing something than die doing nothing he said throwing one of his pebbles at a larger rock especially something heroic something that no one else can do except for us something that will destroy something evil freya sighed and picked up a handful of pebbles as well she started throwing them at the same rock i honestly dont know whats going to happen i dont think this is a happy story the world is so much more complicated than that cheesy because they were children they were able to overcome the evilbutstupid wizard nonsense they feed to you in kids movies that stuff never really happens its just something grownups come up with to make children feel betterto make them think that they arent small and insignificant daniel threw another couple stones maybe although we have come this far we survived an yfelgop attack we even survived ealdstan he said with a grin here he said brightly look what i got he lifted a bundle hed been carrying that was wrapped in an oilcloth unwrapping it he showed her the sword hed picked out pulling it partway out of the scabbard the words that the blacksmith engraved were easy to pick out on the polished surface but freya couldnt read them see this daniel showed one side to her which read haelescieppende ic eom it means heromaker i am thats the name of my sword heromaker and on this side he said flipping the blade over it says ic agenes a daniel tully or i belong to daniel tully now if i stab anyone he said smiling at least theyll know my name freya couldnt help laughing whatever happens daniel said sliding his sword into its sheath ill protect you you know that right freya turned to him her eyes lively and a sardonic grin on her face why would i need protecting from you i was the one who saved you when that thing had you on the floor well yeah but he was going to eat your face she teased gross he was not freya stood on the bench and grabbed her spear brandishing it at him i completely saved you you only want me to come along because im a better warrior than swigar and ecgbryt put together daniel started to duel with her using his sheathed sword hey you said their names right youve been practicing havent you maybe freya grunted attacking him with the blunt end of the spear admit it you want me to come so that i can save your life again he held on to her spear and she spun around and grabbed his arm twisting it playfully around his back admit it ah okay okay youre right leggo freya released him and fell back laughing she seemed to come to herself again and her laughter stilled what is going to happen to us i dont know daniel said a smile still on his face so lets find out the travelers gathered silently around the base of the great carnyxdaniel freya swigar and ecgbryt there were also those who had come to see them offmodwyn godmund frithfroth the servants cnafa and cnapa and another man one who stood a small distance apart making it clear that he didnt want to talk to anyone the blacksmith who had worked on daniels sword ecgbryt fiddled with his packs straps as swigar clamped his teeth on his empty clay pipe freya tugged at her dress and daniel fidgeted with the hilt of his sword remember godmund said reiterating the plan for the umpteenth time there are many paths through the wild caves that will take you to the slpismereand all of them bend downwards once across the slpismere look for any sign that might lead you but remember that which you are pitched against is devious and diabolical they were waiting for ealdstan and he was not soon in coming from time to time daniel glanced up at the large metal hornthe carnyxsuspended in its small blunt fortress the great horn possessed an oddly attractive power it was captivating hypnotic they would tear their eyes away only to be unwittingly drawn back to it again daniel wondered how many knights would wake up and where theyd be if ever the horn was blown how would they know what to do freya however was wondering what sort of enchantment empowered it and how it worked perhaps there was a rational scientific explanation perhaps it was a vibrational thing a bell tolled from across the city signaling the change of the watch and godmund made his goodbye he embraced swigar and ecgbryt and wished the fair lifiendes every good fortune and preservation on the journey which he hoped would be swift he shook hands with them awkwardly and left frithfroth puffed out his cheeks impatiently and scuffed his feet against the closeset green and red marble flagstones removing his pipe and placing it in a small leather pouch swigar cleared his throat time marches on he said firmly and so must we hold said modwyn he approaches they turned to see ealdstan striding across the square a scowl on his face he met them and turned his weary eyes to daniel destroy it boy he commanded destroy whatever houses gads mortalitywhatever the soul box containsand all his spells and sorceries will unravel freya didnt appreciate being ignored in this exchange but was glad she didnt have to talk to the meanspirited wizard daniel returned ealdstans gaze with a fixed face and gave a solemn nod i wont let you down then with a mournful look ealdstan sighed i truly wish it was not necessary for you to become involved he raised his hands and uttered in a steady voice may the hand that makes guide your hearts may the light that illumines shine on your path and the one that goes between aid your steps he dropped his hands unceremoniously then he offered one final piece of advice follow the water he said and turned away modwyn frowned after him and turned to freya as she opened her mouth to speak the alarm bell tolled violently she stiffened startled another attack frithfroth exclaimed his eyes wide with fear he bowed quickly to daniel and freya goodbye children may you return swiftly and whole your task complete he rushed away with the two servants behind him you must hurry modwyn said pushing freya and daniel towards the carnyx building the entrance to the wild caves is within they dashed into it closely followed by the knights passing under a low archway next to which stood several anxious guards once through the arch large metal doors were swung shut and locked behind them the inside of the building was like a small maze the walls and paths twisted and branched making supposedly the centre easier to defend the knights very quickly led them through the narrow passages looking up freya saw that it was the central chamber that housed the carnyx suspended above their heads set into the wall was another pair of stone doors a foot wide tilted back at an angle like the doors to a bunker or storm cellar ecgbryt and swigar flung these open revealing a tunnel that sloped downwards grabbing two silver lanterns and passing one to ecgbryt swigar hurried them inside with tremendous effort he pulled both the stone doors closed they met with an earthshaking thud and sealed so that they were neat and flush with the other stones in the wallas if there had never been a doorway there at all chapter nine trolls in morven now alex moved carefully among the loose rocks and stones that formed the base of morvens northern slope its name could be translated from gaelic as either big mountain or big hill its technical classification was a graham but its name fit either way at over seven hundred meters in height it was certainly a big hill though on the small side for a mountain however in contrast to the otherwise level plain of caithness it seemed enormous being the only feature in an otherwise completely flat landscape the ascent was relatively gentle alex walked beside reverend maccanish who had insisted on accompanying him and being his guide to the area once alex had more fully explained what he expected to find and what he would have to do once he found it it took the reverend little time to change into hiking clothes and rubber boots alex changed into some heavier gearmotorcycle gear actually tough padded leather trousers and a padded leather jacket reinforced in the forearms upper arms chest and back with metal plates he also grabbed a rucksack with different sorts of emergency provisions and a long black object which he slung on his back he finished by lacing up a pair of armyissue steeltoe boots and they set off they had walked only about fortyfive minutes and had made it about halfway around the graham it was a little after noon so they stopped for a break are you sure its a cave youre looking for here i know of none around here there will be something alex answered but incidentally do you know of any caves or other rock formations in the area no nothing like that why do you think it more likely well find the creature there no its probably here alex said offering another oatcake to maccanish we just have to keep our eyes open and our ears even our alex paused even as he was about to say it he caught a whiff of something rotten on the wind what is it maccanish asked slightly alarmed twisting around do you see no its alright alex assured him finish up he said taking a long drink from his bottle of water he packed his things together and brushed his hand over the long rectangular object wrapped in black that lay in his lap do you mind if i see it maccanish asked gesturing alex thought for a moment and raised the black object almost four feet longand handed it to him maccanish fumbled with it for a few moments and then found its rubberized handle and withdrew it from its scabbard its like no sword ive ever seen maccanish said holding it upwards it had just one cutting edge which sloped and tapered at the top so that the blunt end was completely straight to the tip it had a grey brushed finish which meant it didnt shine or glimmer except along the sharpened side it was nearly five inches thick at its widest point and would have been heavy because of this except that it had three irregularly spaced oblong holes to cut down on mass a rivulet ran parallel to the cutting edge its the latest modern design alex said with an ironic air i had it custommade and designed as well as stresstested i told them i was being commissioned by a hollywood movie studio i said i was making a vampire movie its highstrength lowalloy steel thats been subzero treated and coated with a synthetic fluoropolymer it cost a bloody fortune i can imagine maccanish said sheathing the sword once more and youve actually used this thing just a couple times when circumstance warranted it would not a rifle or machine gun do better alex shook his head not for what were hunting my uncle has my greatgrandfathers old claymore but i wouldnt put that up against this maccanish said handing it back to alex ready alex asked standing up the reverend gathered his things together and stood ready lead on they set off again along the side of the mountain where the ground became firmer and covered with heather and ferns the stench that alex had smelt was still in the air and getting thicker do you know what that is he asked maccanish it was obvious what he was referring to something died maybe several things is it what were looking for could be whats this crevice up here it seemed as if there were a fold in the mountain running from the peak to the foot it showed bare rock where rainwater washed the plants away its just a burn it fills to no more than a trickle when it rains there couldnt be anything there listen do you hear that maccanish tilted his head its a sort of buzzing what does it mean it means its worth a look they started down the smooth embedded rocks the smell was almost overpowering now the sick sweet stench of rotting fleshit felt like it was sitting in their throats bones still yellow with brown decaying flesh on them were wedged in between the rocks which a mass of flies were feeding and breeding off of disgusting maccanish said alex unslung his rucksack and flung it to the side he kept his sword hitched up on his back he was getting close he could feel it he tried to focus his mind as he descended farther he tried to clear away any unnecessary thoughts from his consciousness it was the body of a cow that indicated the cave it was sticking out head and forelegs from a clump of ferns still mostly covered in skin but with bits of bone showing around the crown of the skull and the joints on closer and more gruesome inspection it was revealed not to be just half of a carcass but a whole one that was sticking out of a cave mouth about fourbyfivefeet wide and tall you should stay here alex told maccanish if youre uncomfortable the reverend didnt say anything he came and stood closer to alex well in any case alex said drawing his sword and tossing the scabbard to the side stand a little farther off maccanish nodded and hung back as alex advanced it was good the reverend was here to see this someone in the village should see this being done even if no one would believe his accountthat is if he even told anyone someone needed to bear witness alex pulled a glowstick from his pocket snapped it and hung it from his coats lapel the green iridescent glow was eaten by the walls and reflected on a floor covered with skeletal remains and desiccated corpses of animals the bones bore regular gashes along them clustering on the knobby ends see that alex said indicating them tooth marks teeth of what at a guess id say troll youre kidding what billy goats gruff an that close enough to are they big like you wouldnt imagine massive arms and hands but slow at least stay out of reach and youll do fine alex shifted his weight on the uneven ground and kept his sword in front of him he was sweating he willed his heart to slow its humming pace the cave continued and bore to the right as alex banked to the left to see down as far as possible he noticed something was slumped up against the bend that he had mistaken for an outcropping wait he said motioning he stepped closer to it it was as still as a stone and as cold its bullet head was slumped forward onto its barrellike chest arms the size of tree trunks were splayed outwards palms up fingers curled inwards it had laughably small bowed legs and large flipper feet but where its potbelly should have been was a gaping sticky void dried entrails hung out of it torn out and torn apart gutted something had made a meal of it its dead alex said straightening go on take a look i wouldnae hae believed it maccanish said a thicker accent creeping into his voice how long has it been here it couldnae have been here the whole time where did it come from its odd but i honestly dont know theres some as say they grow from the rocks or that the peaty bogs birth them from the skulls of thieves and murderers its possible that they burrow up here but from where i have no idea they like solid rock though thats true enough theyre related to the giants you know incredible so is that it its deadare we finished unfortunately not see its been killed probably by something bigger they usually go in pairs so its poss oh wait here we are alex had stood and was creeping farther into the tunnel around the corner and slumped on the opposite end of the tunnel was the body of another troll not bigger this time but smaller it was likewise eviscerated but its massive trunklike neck was also torn up nearly cut through completely another one maccanish asked moving around this doesnt make sense they look as if they been here for oh over a week i dont alex peered deeper into the tunnel his ears strained for a sound his eyes for a movement he caught a glimmer of something shiny piled a few feet beyond the second troll he moved forward slowly his feet crunching bone beneath him the shiny object was completely circular and reflective what is it what do you see asked maccanish its cdsdozens of them all chucked together just the discs alex turned his body shifting the light he wore and the boxes are over heredvd cases album cases discarded like spent nutshells they just wanted the discs i wonder he bent and prodded around in the pile and found other objectsnecklaces rings metallic crisp wrappers a few silver forks some of it was valuable some of it was rubbish but all of it was shiny oh no alex said horror descending on him what ive made a mistake he sprang up and stared into the black emptiness of the tunnel before him get out of here quickly he hissed what is it im not prepared for this he said gripping his sword with both hands he turned to maccanish did you not hear me i said run he yelled and turned just as the dragon came swooping towards him screeching out of the darkness in the dim light alex caught only a brief flash of long sharp reptilian muzzle and an angry flash of red eyes before he was on the ground winded and pinned beneath a dragon almost six feet in length as he fell he instinctively brought his sword up in front of him it hit between the beasts shoulder and arm but did not bite merely glided along the tough slick scales as they both fell the sword twisted out of his hand and clattered to the ground luckily his left arm had been in front of him and was now between him and the creature he pushed it upwards just in time to fend off the sharp beak that was coming down to meet his head it struck the ground just beside alexs right ear it had been a weak effort on the dragons part otherwise he wouldnt have been so lucky the close quarters were proving difficult for the dragon as it was not able to maneuver its long batwinged arms to either gouge at his sides or even take flight its legs however it could use and he felt one massive clawed foot gripping the inside of his thigh the other trying unsuccessfully to gain purchase just above his hip but succeeding very ably in tearing away layers of clothing and then skin as the dragon brought its head back up alex found he had some breathing space almost quicker than he could think it he brought both hands up and clutched at the monsters throat his hands couldnt meet around it his thumbs embedded themselves in the soft leathery gullet and his fingers fought for purchase on cold scales no bigger than robins eggs but slick and hard as marble its arms still not being able to gain purchase in the cave the dragon was unable to leverage itself in order to attack with its mouth it was a small advantage for alex but not one that afforded him escape or a clear way to defeat his attacker instead he looked into the cold red eyes in fear and horror as thin wisps of white smoke flowed from the dragons mouth between its daggerlike teeth alex felt his hands around the things neck grow warm then hot the white smoke was tinged with grey and black now frantically alex kicked and writhed beneath the animal which was easily twice his own weight strange choking sounds came from the dragons gullet and alex closed his eyes for what was going to happen next alex lower your hands now came a quick command alex let go of the things throat and covered his head between his arms he saw his sword whiz past him in an upward stroke and sink into the dragons head entering just below the jaw the swords tip looked to be lodged in the base of the brain or in its spine the dragon did a back flip off of alex and started thrashing against the walls like a floundering fish first against one wall and then the other alex tried to raise himself and was knocked away from the dying creature by its powerful tail he landed in the arms of maccanish who pulled him farther away the dragon flailed awhile longer and then calmed it made motions as if it was trying to wretch but its mouth was shut firm black blood and bile dripped from its wound and with a final few spasms it fell to the ground and lay dead alex and maccanish stood looking at it for a time dragons dont go in pairs do they maccanish asked eventually no never alex replied thank god amen daniel awoke several times in the night he was accustomed to sleeping in hard and uncomfortable places and allowed himself to wake up fully enough to feed the fire a couple times then settled back onto his leaf bed pulled the cloak tighter and went back to sleep but eventually his body had taken all the rest it had needed and he opened his eyes wide awake and as far as he could tell it was still the dead of night what was it called when you crossed time zones and your body hadnt adjusted yet jet lag what was this thenworld lag how long would it take his body to adapt to fortyeighthour days he tended to the fire again there was a good pile of hot coals that he swept closer together he fed more wood into it to get some flames going again and picked at some of the leftover fish he had cooked he didnt eat too much since he wanted to save some for when he had to get going again but there had been quite a lot allowing himself to become mesmerised by the flames he grew reflective he dug around in his backpack for something that he always kept at the bottom of it always wrapped in several plastic bags he found it and unfolded ita heavy long piece of blue cloth that no longer fit him he let his fingers caress the patterns he lifted it to his nose but it had lost its scent but he didnt need to smell it to remember very gradually it became brighter and he felt that soon he would be able to make a move he wrapped the uneaten fish in one of the plastic bags and stuck them in his backpack using his feet he spread and stamped out the glowing embers of the fire which he had allowed to die down then he turned to face the wood forest for all that you gave me last night i thank you without exceptionbut now that its morning and getting quite light please show me the path to the woodburners hut and then uncertain what to do next since no path instantly appeared at his feet he left the clearing he counted his footsteps and hadnt reached one hundred before he found himself on a small ledge above a beaten dirt path shaking his head and laughing in spite of himself he set his shoulders and resolved himself to a long trek he kept his pace steady but stopped and rested after a couple hours there was a rock by the roadside and he settled himself onto it the birds were flitting through the trees opposite him pausing every once in a while on a thin branch he didnt know much about birds these were small brown and there seemed to be a lot of them they would twist their heads and look at him give a little peep of exclamation and then flutter away to another branch to look at him from another angle he contemplated the strangeness of being in another place that was so different and so similar to his own world he walked on losing track of the hours losing track of himself in the forest when he grew hungry he asked the forest for food and he would come across a bush full of berries or a clump of large white mushrooms when he got thirsty and his water container was empty he asked for water and would walk until a small spring or stream crossed his path what he couldnt understand was whether the forest was creating these things for him on request or if they existed already and was just moving them into his path or if it was all just a coincidence the light was starting to get dimmer and daniel wondered if he would have to stop and make camp for another night when he noticed the sharp tang of burning wood in the air as he continued along the path it grew stronger eventually getting to the point where his eyes stung slightly anticipation grew within him as he noticed thick white smoke wafting through the trees up ahead he must be getting close slowing his pace he continued around a bend in the road and then he was there before him was a sight that was strange to his eyesa large dirt mound as wide as a house and about two stories in height it was cylindrical but tapered towards the top where an open hole billowed smoke standing near the large structure leaning on a spade was a tall gnarled man who was nearly as knotted and twisted as the trees encircling the clearing he had thick corded forearms and largeknuckled hands his hair was grey and his face was tanned and weathered he wore a shirt and leggings of coarse green cloth and his shoes were carved out of wood daniel edged nearer stopping a good few yards off hello he said hoarsely the old man didnt turn right away but when he did it was only to cast a disinterested eye in his direction daniel cleared his throat are you the woodburner the other did not respond immediately you speak a strange tongue the man said after a time im not from here the elfs eyes flicked up and down him you are one of the heavy people he stated daniel looked down at himself apologetically he didnt know how to reply to this make yourself useful the man said abruptly go and close the south flue take the pole over there he gestured to a small rack of tools set into a tree daniel went over and selected a stick about his height that had a crude bronze hook inserted into one end then he walked around the large structurewhich was giving off a fair amount of heatuntil he found a small metal door sticking out of the baked mud inside a vertical stack of logs could be seen burning with a bright yellow glow he used the pole to nudge the flue closed there was a latch that he lifted and let fall with a clack then he walked back and replaced the hook on the rack he returned to stand near the woodburner and joined him in looking at the furnace in what he hoped was companionable silence kay marrey sent me here daniel said after a suitable interval he didnt get a reply or even as much as a twitch from the man hes one of the elves in exile i know who marrey is the man said slowly evenly young excitable always running hither and thither he made a toandfro motion with one of his hands where are you from idont know what to call it but its another world entirely can you help me get back in some weeks there is a market where many tradesmen and travelers congregate no doubt someone will point you the right way travel between worlds used to be very common after all is there any way i could find one sooner the tall person shook his head it would take you longer to track one down best let them come here are you fit can you lift chop carry climb i am as you see me daniel responded holding his arms out slightly and i will lift chop and carry as much and for as long as i am able climb im not so sure but ill give it a go may be possible to get a second mound up then before the trade the man straightened to what must have been eight feet in height well see i use what the forest gives me and its given me you so well put you to work wont we freya came out of her sleep slowly gradually becoming aware that she was slumped forward on a table she hoisted herself upwards and looked around she was in her office sitting at her desk that was littered with page after page of complex numerical equations all of them in her own handwriting that was odd she thought she was somewhere else it had become so easy for her to throw herself into her work and she went so deep into it that sometimes she literally forgot where she was she sighed when did she become a mathematician a large book lay open in front of her propped against the windowsill on the two facing pages were tables of letters and numbers listed in pairs triplets and quadrupletsin total about a hundred rows and a dozen columns it was headed akv stringsnominative there was a smaller but much older book also open in front of her that contained very small type the righthand page was in greek and the lefthand page was in english her eyes went to the first paragraph and read now the wisdom belonging to afterthought which is an aeon thought a thought derived from herself from the thinking of the invisible spirit and from prior acquaintance she wanted to show forth within herself an image without the spirits will and her consort did not consent and she wished to do so without his pondering for the person of her maleness did not join in the consent for she had not discovered that being which was in harmony with her freya rubbed her eyes and tried to remember what the text was referring to she had gotten so involved in decoding and recoding all the nominations that she had lost perspective on the context of the words or maybe it was best to keep going through the text mechanically and focus on the meaning of the uncoded text hows it coming freya jumped the reverend was standing behind her looking at her work oh peterim so sorry i didnt know you were there he smiled perfectly alright at least i know im not being a nuisance if you forget im even here how is it coming fine said freya ive just finished breaking down and gridding the third chapter now i just have to look for patternsthat is the easiest part for meand then retranslate i should have the whole book done by the end of the month good good the reverend said smiling she could never tell how much he took in he was always so sweetnatured can i get you anything she asked no no i was just thinking that i should leave you carry on ill see myself out freya went back to her work she glanced over the different papers but found it difficult to see where she had left off why exactly was she doing this she looked at the clock when was he getting back it was starting to get dark she knew she shouldnt worry but she couldnt help it there was the sound of a key turning in the door it opened and closed felix hello darling she got up from the desk and went into the hallway how was your day she asked not bad all things considered yours i think im losing my mind i was breaking down the secret book of john beautiful book yes well i was breaking it down and it all just suddenly became page upon page of meaningless numbers those numbers arent meaningless stowe stressed i know i just mean it all became so abstractlike i lost perspective ah well perhaps its time to finish for the night why dont you have a seat and ill cook something no dont freya said putting her arms around professor stowes middle youve had just as long a day as ive had perhaps but my work is far less important than yours go into the lounge and ill bring some wine in to you okay freya gave him a peck on the cheek and went into the sitting room on the way she passed her office and without even looking into the room snaked her hand through the doorway and flicked the light off then she settled into the sofa and closed her eyes just for a moment sweetie freya opened her eyes felix was standing over her gently patting her shoulder hello he said grinning she sat up and looked around her where am oh she was on the sofa coffee table in front of her with several used plates glasses and an empty bottle of wine on it you just drifted off you silly goose m still hungry she said sleepily no youre notyoure just exhausted here lie still ill carry you to bed what dont be ridiculous i can no i insist im far too heavy not yet you arent theresee freya clung to his neck as he straightened up and then carried her through to the bedroom my gallant knight she said as he lowered her down and arranged the covers over her are you going to join me my darling wife i have an appointment with the lieutenant remember oh yes of course but ive got a few minutes shall i tell you a story something that happened to me today freya smiled and snuggled closer mkay thatd be nice i was walking along the river when i ran into a friend of mine who i thought had seen me but proceeded to walk right past me i turned around and caught up with him and asked if anything was wrong he said no he was fine but hed just been told the most puzzling and confusing story in his life i asked him if it would help if he shared it with me and he said it might as we stood there in the street this is what he said i was with a group of friends in a pub when one of our lecturers wandered in and walked directly to the bar we waved to him but he seemed wrapped in his own thoughts which was odd since he wasnt one of those absentminded academics but a young and witty man who we all loved he ordered a whiskey and stood staring at it not even taking a sniff of it i left my friends and went up to him to ask him what was the matter this was what he said ive just come from the hospital bed of a friend of mine weve known each other since university where he studied law he was a very diligent soul who eventually became a high court judge and was known for his clearminded evenhanded judgments i had lost touch with him in the last ten years or so but a week ago i heard from his wife who informed me that he had fallen ill and that he had been troubled of late with a moral quandary that was doing him no favours due to his illness and would i mind paying him a visit to help thrash it out i agreed of course when i saw my friend in his hospital bed i knew that there was no real cause for alarm he was still as strong and as vital as ever but his mind seemed to be absenthe was not the sharp incisive man i had known at length i managed to tease out of him the cause for his distraction clearing his throat and casting his eyes around the room he replied three years ago i sat a case which at the time was no more interesting than any other id heard during my career the specifics of it are hazy to me but the case itself isnt important suffice to say my judgment effected a fine and eight months in prison for a young woman with no dependents i thought no more about the matter it was a year later that a letterjust one sheet of paperwas delivered to my office written by the defendant this is what it said verbatim dear siryou may remember me from a case twelve months ago it was a charge of driving under the influencemy third offencemade more serious by a possession of class b drugsmy first offence my impression was that you were lenient with me dismissing the drugs charge and instead sentenced me with the full weight of the driving charge this struck me as generous even kind and that made me think that a man like you would be good in a difficult situation i hope you wont mind therefore if i impose upon you to relate a story that i heard while i was detained at her majestys pleasure that was told to me by one of the guards usually alert and on the ball i one day noticed her to be confused and somewhat distant i asked her what was he matter and this was her answer i have four children two sons and two daughters all healthy and happy except for the last one my son and that only during the last ten days hes a priest by trade in a catholic church in a village in norwich we that is my husband and i were visiting him last thursday and we were aware that he was totally distracted it took us a solid hour of coaxing and cajoling for us to get the reason out of him at length he told us five days ago i was in the confessional and a person entered with the most queer story im not breaking any vows or confidences for he confessed no sinsto relate it i will not tell you his name all i will say is that he is a local businessman of great success this is what he said every thursday i volunteer at a shelter that serves meals to the homeless we take turns at different tasks and this day it was my turn to socialise with the guests just before we shut upas we were clearing away and clearing outan old man who was a regular there grabbed my sleeve and pulled me into the seat next to him he told me that he had something to tell me freya began to doze slipping in and out of consciousness trying as hard as she could to concentrate i was sitting on a street corner felix was saying when i saw a man reading a book he had the strangest expression on his face i went over and asked him what he was reading and he said it was the weirdest story hed ever come across i asked him what it was and this is what he said daniel found the routine of charcoalmaking satisfying and an easy style of living to fall into it was a twentyfourhouraday jobor however many hours there were in this new place daniel still wasnt sure at first he found it hot and sweaty work then he found it strenuous and exhausting work when he had met the collierthe name daniel found for charcoalmakershe had been entering the final stages of the process intently studying the smoke issuing from the top of the mound waiting for the right moment when the smoke was thin and started to turn blue as soon as this happened he went around the mound and closed the ventilation holes then he climbed up the side of the mound and told daniel to hand him some more thick sections of turf which he piled onto the top the air supply completely cut off they waited for the furnace to cool he welcomed daniel into his hut which was spare but comfortable no more than a wooden room dug partway into the ground with earth piled on top of it but it was good shelter it contained no bed or bedding material only a ring of stones in the centre creating a fire pit and a hole in the ceiling to let the smoke out there was a wooden box pantry of stores adjoined to a small stable that contained one massive horse that stood patiently thoughtfully chewing oats the collier drew a pan of water from a small wooden cistern and washed splashing water on his face and forearms and then allowed daniel to do the same then he opened the store cupboard peering around him daniel saw that it was filled with stoppered bottles and jars all of different sizes he pulled out a tall beakershaped jar and pulled out a wooden cork he took a drink paused and then took another he handed it to daniel drink he instructed daniel paused i was told not to take anything that i didnt ask to be given to me the collier gave him a nod good advice though while you work for me you wont need to ask for you act under my authority what authority is that he asked curious my own authority the collier said simply daniel took a sip from the flask and tasted a rich spicy cinnamony drink that was thick and sweet it is very good he said it is nourishing that is all daniel handed the drink back to the collier do you have anything to eat food the other returned like animal flesh that or bread or fruit or something the collier shook his head i am not used to entertaining those of the heavy races here you dont eat daniel asked not eat very oftenonly during festivals and feast days try to live on thisif it pains you i will try to procure other fare daniel nodded as if that made sense what world is this exactly this world is our world we dont give it a name but you stand on a continent that we call elfland and so youre an elf yes i am and everyone who lives here is an elf the collier nodded i met an elf once a long time ago do you have a king as you are here you should learn to speak our language replied the collier after a pause what was your question again do you have a king our word for king is reesh in our language names come first so you would ask me reesh yka he looked at daniel expectantly reesh yka daniel said to him filliu sa ennym oo reesh the collier answered that means filliu is the name of our king propped up against the side of the colliers hut as its owner sat on a stool daniel received his first lesson in the elf language then they rose and went to the wood furnace under the colliers direction daniel helped to peel back the layers of baked dirt to reveal the rich black charcoal underneath once done they started to sift the charcoal removing bits of wood that hadnt burned entirely and putting the rest of the black sooty material into some of a dozen large barrels that the collier wheeled out one by one from behind his hut the charcoal lumps were sorted roughly according to size by the collier himself filliu the collier said abruptly tossing a double handful of burnt coal into a barrel is our king in name only his father was ghrian and he was the last good elfin king of our land what happened to him ghrian died and his younger brother whose name was aarnieu took control of the throne in defiance of the kings son filliu who was away at the time hunting the usurping king had nine sons capricious men who reveled in submitting themselves to every perverted whim they decreed the beginning of a new era a new house of royalty he and his sons styled themselves the fr folk of the fated house the collier spat and then did not speak again they worked in silence and by the time it grew quite dark they had done a good deal of sorting but still had over a third left to do what happened to filliu the kings son daniel asked during the evening meal their conversations were in the colliers native tongue with halts and pauses for the explanation of words aarnieu held the funeral banquet for king ghrian near the kings burial ground in a magnificent tent that he erected for the occasion all of the nobles and warrior chiefs attended the feast no less in love for the fact that honour commanded it none were armed except for the nine sons and the banquets servers who were really aarnieus soldiers they had knives concealed in their boots at a certain moment in the evening the command was given and the servers drew their knives and plunged them into the throats of the elfin lords aarnieu knew to be loyal to young prince filliu there was another long pause as the collier continued with his meal he finished his food then took a swig of wine wiping his lips on his sleeve as it happened there was a certain lord at the feast by the name of nock he caught a gleam of a knife across the table and this alerted him to aarnieus plan he rose to defend prince filliuwhose assassin hesitated perhaps due to conscience or the weight of the moment this gave nock the opportunity to defend the prince and the blade intended for the boy returned to its master sheathing itself in his bone and breaking in a rage nock reached for a pole that was helping to prop up the tent wall and wrenched it from the ground with this weapon he was able to club off the other attackers who came at him only with knives he broke many arms legs and skulls that night dispatching many evildoers to their final judgment in this way he was able to save prince filliu they were the only two of the old regime to escape what happened to them daniel asked aarnieu had not counted on any of the lords leaving the table let alone the tent and so was unprepared for pursuit and the two were able to depart without much chase the next day aarnieu announced himself the first faerie king and his sons regents to the throne who would upon his death jointly control the kingdom now called frieland for the only time daniel knew him the collier smiled that night king aarnieu was found dead stabbed nine times in the chest daniel fascinated though he was at this story couldnt keep a yawn from escaping you are weary do you need to sleep this last word was in english daniel nodded his head yes id better arent you tired elves do not sleep our bodies are lightnot so leaden as yours your essences are always sinking like earth and stone ours mingle in the air we tire and rest but do not close our eyes do what you may to make yourself comfortable and come and find me again when youhe thought for a momentstop sleeping and so it was that the evening of daniels second day in elfland found him in another pile of leaves and wrapped in his new cloak but in the corner of the coalmakers hut and not in the elements it was another very long night punctuated by hours of silent thought where daniel was able to meditate on his situation and the new language he was learning outside he could hear the collier still working sorting through the charcoal and occasionally going into the forest it was quite dark even outside but daniel supposed that elfish eyes were better than human eyes no doubt due to their airy essences at length daniel rose before it was still quite light outside to find that the collier had finished sorting the charcoal into barrels and was now sharpening two axes with a smooth stone he greeted him and handed him a drinking skin which apparently held the days breakfast living on the streets daniel was used to an irregular diet but wondered how long he could go with no solids come with me the woodcollier instructed handing daniel one of the axes if you are a good worker we may be able to start a second pit daniel followed him eagerly into the wood walking behind as he pointed out the trees that needed felling these were usually trees that were damaged or diseased or ones that posed a threat to other plants around them this is why the forest allows me to take from it the woodcollier explained i remove what is harmful to the forestwhat is dead and decaying the forest thanks me for this and allows me to stay what would it do to you if it didnt want you to stay daniel asked the woodcollier didnt answer he was looking up instead at the treetops where a large limb of a tree had splintered away and was caught in the upper branches as easy as anything the collier went over to a tree and started scaling it as fast as walking and with one hand still holding an axe are you coming the collier asked daniel when he was already halfway up the tree i dont think so daniel said he tapped his chest heavy remember he thought he heard the collier grunt and continue up to the branch daniel tried to see what he was doing there were chopping noises and some creaks there was a call for him to look out and then the sound of branches creaking and giving way daniel took several leaps back as the large tree limb landed before him with a loud crunk the collier descended and went to the branch straddling it watch what i do he said raising the tool above his head and bringing it down at the base of a large branch he did this a few times placing one cut over another until the branch gave way completely now you the collier said dragging the branch away and gesturing to a branch of the same size on the other side of the tree daniel moved into position and hefted his axe stop the collier commanded already wrong stand here cut upwards with the grain strike here he pointed across the branch daniel did as he was directed the head of the axe lodged in the wood and sent a rough vibration up his arm good but dont push the head into the woodput some force into it and let the axe fall of its own use a strong steady hand with a gentle touch continue daniel made more strokes some of which went embarrassingly wide of his mark and finally after about fifteen blows managed to cut the branch away while the collier looked on good keep going he said and then started working the other side of the tree laying into a particularly large branch after a while daniel asked do the nine sons of aarnieu rule elfland now or frieland rather the faerie princelings yes they do they used the death of their father and the disappearance of filliu as an excuse to hunt down and kill the remaining supporters of the late king ghrian it was plain to anyone with half a brain what had happened but the populace decided to play along with a comfortable lie rather than fight for a difficult truth this has opened the royal court up to any number of flatterers and extorters there is one ive had several runins withagrid fiall who is particularly devious daniel had managed to remove two more branches and started on the third when the collier said stop you are weary never swing an axe in that state rest a moment in truth daniels arms particularly his shoulders were nearly falling off daniel laid his axe on the ground and moved off to lean against a tree wait the collier commanded never leave any tool just lying around that is dangerous disrespectful of both the instrument and your craft and speaks badly of the craftsman always keep it with you if you must leave it anywhere for any reason leave it like this he raised his axe and struck the fallen tree with it where the trunk was thickest the handle stuck out at a degree angle daniel crouched against a tree out of the way he rested there sweating hard and studying the colliers form as he attacked the tree with a smooth and graceful confidence born out of experience the faerie rule is vast and now encompasses all the elfin cities and villages only the farthest territories and hardesttoreach places remain beyond their rule at least beyond their interest unfortunately i cannot say that of this forest the faerie territories are ruled by the nine princes who have all degenerated into frivolous perversities two hundred years ago on a whim each of them wed nine sisters who they pass around among them with as little sense of proprietorshipnot to say loveas dumb beasts when daniel felt that he had cooled and rested enough he rose and started working the tree again at the woodsmans side what about the elves in exile he asked we dont speak of them here the collier said curtly and that was the end of the conversation for another couple hours until the tree was fully stripped and they made their way back to the hut the elves in exile the collier said as they ate lunch in the shade of his hut is the name of the court of the true king of elflandthey preserve the royal line unbroken for over eight thousand years they believe that one day when the people most desire it they will storm the elfin palace and reclaim the throne by now daniel was tired and exhausted daniel explained about his own time and the length of days and the collier let him sleep some of the afternoon at the hut he felt sure that he had been awake a full day but the sun was still high in the sky when daniel awoke he found another pile of branches but no collier he set about stripping them again then as it was getting towards evening the collier returned with the actual tree trunk itself which had now been cut into three sections the collier taught daniel how to saw and split the wood in the proper lengths and he did this until it was too dark to work they took dinner then and daniel dozed off as they sat outside the hut together in silence under the stars that was daniels third day in elfland the days after that continued much the same waylong periods of work that involved going into the forest to fetch wood and then cutting it into lengths appropriate for the charring pit daniel steadily improved his skill at talking to the collier in his own language and was pleased at his growing fluency after two more days they had gathered enough wood to be able to build the pits this was done by first scraping the current pit then uncovering an old one in the same clearing but on the other side of the hut grass had grown over that one which was to become useful later the collier cut the turf into rectangular sections with a thin flat shovel and daniel helped to lift these sections up and set them to one side the bottom of it was then raked flat and a thin base of the powdered charcoal was laid down on both sites the two pits were carefully and cleverly piled with logs of various shapes and sizes arranged in a circle with a round gap or chimney at the centre the collier took a thousand pains to ensure that the pits were built to a perfect standard often giving logs just a minute turn so that the space between them was exactly so then they set about covering the woodpiles with the cut turf tightly packing it close together everywhere except the very top which was for the chimney dry soil was spread over where the turf did not extend it was getting late in the evening when the collier was satisfied enough to light them both he made a small fire with charcoal from the previous batch and once that was burning nicely he divided up the coals with his shovel and with orange sparks dancing high into the night sky tipped them into both of the bonfires chimneys where with a quiet crackle and a rich musty smell they started to kindle the rest of the wood then they sat back and watched it was vitally important that the piles burnt steadily evenly and not too hot the collier took constant turns around the piles laying his hands upon the turf walls checking the vents and gazing into the smoke that had started to billow from the two chimney holes daniel followed him around there were a few energetic moments when fire broke through the turf wall and they had to hurry to repair the breach after these first few hours the collier judged that the stacks were burning well enough that they could relax and take dinner which was from a different bottle this time they drank and watched the piles daniel gazed up at the stars which were strange and unfamiliar none of the constellations he learned when he was young were there which was disturbing but also exciting he had to get back to freya exhaustion overcame daniel then and he fell into a deep and wellearned sleep chapter ten the wild caves before the wild caves were certainly wild but it was hard for daniel and freya to think of them as just caves at certain points they would open out into enormous expanses that seemed more like underground landscapes it was hard to make out features in these areas since the vast emptiness swallowed their feeble lamplight but there would sometimes be a glittering seam that would throw their light back at them or a pale green luminescence swathed against a rock face then without warning they would enter another tunnel or turn a corner to find themselves in disturbingly small and claustrophobic passages that might wind on for miles without giving them a chance to stand up straight the air hung around them thick with cold and clammy moisture generally swigar led them along whichever path appeared to offer the quickest downward loop the slpismere they knew was a long way down so whenever possible they would follow wateranything from a small trickle to a river just about any stream of water would eventually lead to the huge underground lake they reasoned sooner or later however each stream or trickle of water fell into a drain or slipped into a crack in the wall this was frustrating yet they always seemed to happen across another ribbon of water they could follow refreshing themselves and refilling their waterskins when they had been walking downwards for what seemed like days they came to a sharp ridge of slate where they paused a draft rising from below sent warm waves of heat rolling over them causing them to sweat they stayed for a time sitting on the ridge opening up their clothing and taking off their shoesexposing everything that they had to the warm air in order to dry them as much as possible there was no way of telling where the air came from but daniels mind pictured an open lake of lava beneath them sending its heat up towards them through a series of vents but ever before and after that the wild caves were invariably cold wet and miserably dark the thick oilcloth traveling cloaks and boots were snug enough but not completely waterproof finding a place to camp was a constant difficulty since there was no way to mark the passage of time below the earth and they had no watches it was hard to estimate how long they had been walking or how long they should keep walking many times they would hunt around for a bit of dry ground and spend some time setting up camp only to find sleep still a long way off the physical hardships would have been enough but having no knowledge of how far they had gone or had left to go was what daniel and freya found most dispiriting only determination kept them from depression daniels desire to get stronger and better at traveling helped him keep putting one foot in front of the other freyas thought of how many people depended on their mission kept her feet moving forward long after they had started to cramp and ache swigar was grim and serious he seldom spoke walking always in the lead keeping his eyes open and ears alert for any clue of danger or trouble in the path ahead ecgbryt on the other hand exalted in the prospect of danger and adventure the knights were ideal traveling companionsthey seemed to be walking libraries ecgbryt would go a ways in silence and then suddenly launch into a tale about a battle he had participated in usually with king lfred against the vikings daniel would always press him with questions about the details of his exploits but would be forced into silence when his store of questions was exhausted freya found ecgbryt and daniel exasperating at times and preferred walking with swigar up ahead she was fond of his riddles and he seemed to know hundreds of them she only ever guessed a few of them correctly but a good one would keep her mind turning for hours before she allowed swigar to tell her the answer she was never disappointedeven when she needed him to explain the answer she even memorised a couple of her favorites both daniel and freya enjoyed the knights ballads both knew long ballads that sometimes took over an hour to recite some of them were so complex they had no idea how the warriors kept them all separate in their headsalthough one of them would correct the other from time to time ecgbryts songs and poems all seemed to be about battles and heroic deeds swigars about journeys and strange experiences and observations they had been following the path of a small streambarely a trickle of water that ran steadily downwards through a narrow gutterlike tunneland this lead them into a larger open space where the echoes of their movements grew further apart and softer and a stiff wind blew across them more significantly they heard sounds that they did not cause whisht hissed swigar motioning them to stop they all held their breath crouching to let their ears pick out sounds of shuffling and scraping the sounds were regular and continuous not the sounds of people trying not to be heard i think i see something said freya just up ahead its a kind of swirling motionthings moving around a lightup there on that rock swa swa so it also seems to me said swigar let us approach cautiously there may be danger in the shadows let it fall upon us ecgbryt huffed it will meet my axe coming up to greet it the night before lfred harried the viking chieftain hastein at appledore and milton hush broor commanded swigar i am sorry but my weapon is mighty tired from being carried around like an infant it longs to stretch itself i will stretch it across your head if you do not strap your tongue to your teeth swigar snapped testily he halted in front of them but did not turn around gods wounds you are a worse prattler than asser aye broor said ecgbryt with a wink at daniel who grinned back at him aye calm yourself it is well they crept forward approaching the lit figure looking around daniel could see that they were entering what seemed to be a confluence of tunnels the walls were honeycombed with black twisting holes of various sizesfrom tall black foreboding ruptures in the walls that spewed cold winds to holes small enough to perhaps only wriggle through but that were so smooth they may have been sanded out of the stone the atmosphere was a bewildering confusion of cross breezes and vortexes the wide flat ground stretching before them was about the size and dimension of a football pitch and looked like some sort of abandoned mining site littered with old rickety frames and boards that were slowly rotting next to decaying bits of canvas and string a dry and crumbling bucket lay beside an old well and there was the occasional stone ring that encircled a firescorched spot of earth freya could now make out the moving shapes more clearly they were people all milling slowly around a glowing violet light she blinked her eyes and shook her head for a moment she thought there was something wrong with her but then she figured it outit was definitely people that she saw but as she came nearer she found that they were very very small at first she had assumed them to be far away but now she saw that they were quite close the tallest of them could be no more than two feet high there seemed to be about thirty or forty of them walking around a shiny cylindrical object that was nearly as big as they werea brass lamp that gave off a faint purple light half of them were moving in one direction and half of them in the other the lines wove in and out but without any bumping jostling or confusion like bees around a hive freya thought closer she could see that the little people were wearing roughly woven clothes of dark and faded colours some wore curious felt hats others had twine belts some had tattered shoes but most were barefoot the men had long beards and the women wore long tresses all were dumpy with sagging faces glumly circling the brass lamp faces to the light murmuring to each other in low tones all except one on a smallish boulder that nonetheless placed him several heads height above the others sat a fat figure much better clothed than the rest even if just as glum gnomes groaned swigar shaking his head cuthbert preserve us gnomes repeated daniel really what do they do i mean what are they where are they from they are a longlived peopleperhaps the smallest of the underground races they make their homes in the corners unused by the other earthlivers they are generally happy folk and do not usually intend harm or mischief to any not that it would make much difference if they were to ecgbryt muttered they mimic the actions of other racesof men elves dwarfs and even goblins i have heard tell i would guess that the one on the rock is the king or chieftain ecgbryt snorted the dwarfish races sometimes use them as cheap helpmates they dont ask for money content only to do what they see the dwarfs doing he shrugged why do they copy others freya asked they are healfmods answered ecgbryt that is halfspirited or halfmindedthey do not think entirely for themselves all of them share their thoughts such as they are with the rest apart each of them is stupid together in truth together they are not much more the gnomes were still moving and muttering to themselves in low voices just as they had before the only sign that they had registered the presence of the four newcomers was a quick dart of the eyes towards and away from the strangers although their faces still remained sad and mournful not in the least surprised or interested the travelers stood and watched for a time the steady circling movement and purple light was oddly hypnotic and relaxing daniel feared that he might turn into one of those mindless gnomes if he didnt say or do something soon stepping forward he drew a deep breath and called hello in a loud voice the gnome on the rock jumped his eyes comically wide all of the gnomes stopped instantly as their heads spun around from every direction until they stopped at daniel who said that said one with a bushy beard whos there said another a woman with a hat who said what asked a third hello answered a fourth whos there asked a fifth what said a sixth this fit of responses took daniel by surprise and he stood in silence with the others the chief had looked at him expectantly as if he had spoken though he never said a word um he began again his eyes going from the chief to the crowd of gnomes and back again my name is daniel and uh imi mean weare looking for a tunnel down to the slpismere if any of you that is if all of you er know of a way down then thatd be you know great uh otherwise if you dont then thats okaybut if you do do you think you could daniel could hear himself babbling stupidly but he couldnt stop about sixty eyes were on him staring steadily and expectantly it wasnt until ecgbryt put a hand on his shoulder that he broke off best go easy eling ecgbryt said gently then he addressed the small crowd the slpismere we seek it where is it they seek the slpismere oh dear where is it i say what is it alas who wants it alack who is it slpismere oh my the slpismere this time the chieftain closed his eyes and seemed to exert considerable effort before opening his mouth hello he managed eventually hi said freya whats your name negan the gnome answered after a shorter pause and a little less effort we are called negan oh freya nodded okay the other gnomes were standing quietly watching the travelers we understand that you seek the slpismere yes thats right the gnome closed his eyes and nodded his head wisely have you found it he asked opening them again freya faltered and daniel picked up the conversation again no do you know where it is this brought the gnome chorus back again where is it the slpismere wheres the slpismere the slpismere forsooth whats one of those who had it last oh me where is it oh my the gnome chieftain closed his eyes and the murmuring stopped no he said after a time we dont know where it is it may be down one of these tunnels he said gesturing around him not that we would know why not havent you been down them freya asked didnt you make them daniel asked down them ha began the chorus make them ho been them hee ah whats the point oh whats the use eh so many tunnels i wonder who did make them the chorus stopped no the gnome chief replied simply we have not they know nothing said ecgbryt perhaps they do swigar said how long has it been since you came here he asked the gnome chief long enough too long time flies its not so bad after a while when werent we here ages long the gnome chief sighed oh we dont know after a while all time is the samea minute seems as long as an hour and the other way around how long have you been here we just got here freya replied growing frustrated oh well you wont stay though youre welcome to i dare say but if you do leave i fancy youll return just like our cousin your cousin yes youre bound to see him if you wait long enough his name is gegan he travels here and there hell be here in a minute or so a couple hours at the most why arent you all with him freya asked with a cautious glance at the rest of the staring gnomes oh there doesnt seem to be any point said negan why not asked freya all of the gnomes answered at once whats the use whats the point welladay alack alas im hungry woe well why would we go with him answered negan peevishly all roads lead one placeand you always end up where you happen to be theres no getting away from it anyway im already here so why not stay put ach spat ecgbryt there is nothing to be got from the wee men i say we press on but which way swigar asked stroking his beard ecgbryt did not answer he just trudged off daniel looked around at the grim desolation of the gnomes mining camp its not very nice here is it he said wouldnt you like to go somewhere better well naturally negan the gnome chief replied petulantly but one could just as easily end up somewhere worse here at least one has choices but its only a choice if you choose it freya argued ah yes you see how futile it is said the gnome with a nod of sympathy no i dont said daniel hotly it sounds like the stupidest thing ive heard just go somewhere anywhere and if you dont like it then you can go somewhere elsesomewhere better negan shrugged i could be somewhere better than somewhere worse if i just stay here he said thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard daniel shouted throwing his arms above his head and stomping off freya and swigar were left with the gnomes and nothing more to say after a few moments the tiny people began milling slowly around the brass lamp wallowing in the purple light once more hey look daniel called from across the camp more lamps freya turned and saw daniel standing by a large metal rack that held a long line of glinting glass and metal cylinders he had taken one of them and was dusting it off he held the base up to his ear and shook it its got stuff in it i think these might still work he said do you want one freya was about to answer but was stopped by a hearty shout of ho there they turned to see another crowd approaching them a second mass of gnomes with a character very like negan leading them he was so like the chief gnome that he was almost identical except that his face beamed happiness and jollity behind him the flock of gnomes was clustered four of whom carried a lamp raised up by two wooden poles have you been talking to my cousin he bellowed brightly are you gegan asked daniel this provoked a chorus from the gnomes behind him gegan yes gegan the great gegan the fartraveled the thickcalved sing praise for gegan hiphippity ho hooray yes i am gegan the second gnome king answered proudly have you been here long no thats good it means you couldnt have been talking to him long were sorry you had to talk to him at all it must have been very depressing for youit always depresses us there was a babble of voices from the negan gnomes behind them gegan is back oh no not gegan back from where this time i wonder i dont like gegan here we go again negan the glum king gazed placidly into his own lantern back again so soon brother he called out drearily well yes said gegan as a matter of fact we are back from where asked daniel bracing himself here there hither and yon afar and beyond i cant remember back exclaimed the gnome king expansively from my travels have you explored these tunnels swigar asked joining them do you know where they lead explored them most of them all of them how many are there how many are we nearly all of them gegan said many of them several times arent they magnificent why i never tire of them even after all these years really asked daniel we were just deciding where we should go go repeated gegan aye our toes twitch and feet itch said ecgbryt we are trying to reach the lower levels swigar said dwarfing the gnome king like a tree to the slpismere which tunnel do we take for that there was a murmur of confusion behind the gnome king none of the gnomes actually said anything just made doubtful noises gegan stroked his chin we cant rightly say not having been to the end of any one of themso we cannot say where they lead as such he trailed off his hand moving up to rub his head it was awhile before anyone spoke but you justyou saidfreya stammeredthat youve explored them all oh weve been in them true enough but we never go too far before we turn back to try another one we simply love to travel you see but once you take one road you cant take another what if we were to choose a wrong one and ended up where we didnt want to be then what would we do no its best to come back here and review my decision every once in a while thats the only way i can be sure to find the right one his cheeks propped up a hopeful smile ecgbryt let out a bellowing laugh so friend gnome you are always walking and never arriving gegans eyes shifted uncertainly and he frowned youre just like them freya said throwing a finger towards the miserable negan ho gegan laughed and shook his head theres a world of difference between us he stays here because he hates to go anywhere where as i i he faltered daniel turned to the stillsmiling gegan and asked which one of these tunnels goes the farthest downwards dozens of small arms and fingers pointed out in separate directions gegan thought for a moment and the arms and fingers swiveled one by one to indicate one of the larger exits from the cavern this one probably he said well its more than we knew before said daniel as ecgbryt came to stand behind him its worth a try freya freya nodded reluctantly swigar yes i suppose it will do wonderful lets go gegan daniel said after watching them pass with a thoughtful eye gegan ran up alongside them his sandals clicking merrily and his clan padding eagerly behind him yes and we will come with you he chirped excitedly if we cannot assure you by our words then we will convince you by our feet that we really do love to travel hold on a second daniel said pausing at the rack of lanterns freya do you want one they picked out a couple they could use for as long as the fuel lasted with little trouble they were able to light them the lamps were heavy but gave off a good steady lighteven with the wicks kept quite low the light seemed to go farther than their own lamps but it wasnt easy to say if the purple light was brighter they burned with a rich sweet aroma as if incense was mixed in with the oil ready to depart the clan gegan dutifully took their place up ahead and the rest followed behind for a good time the gnomes walked merrily along singing strange songs with complex choruses that they sometimes muddled up but gradually the singing became weaker and the clan appeared to grow oddly agitated gegan himself began to twitch and rub his neck then he started to cast longing looks behind him a strained smile on his face you want to go back stated freya dont you yes well no its not that its just we have never been this far before i thought that was the exciting part daniel said sarcastically there were groans and a cry of weyladay before gegan said well not exactly the fun part is traveling but we were just thinkingwhat if one of the other tunnels was better what if it led more in the direction that you want to go we thought this one a good choice but now that one comes to it what if weve only just started said daniel the gnome speaks true swigar said stopping behind them he and ecgbryt needed to stoop down slightly to walk this tunnel the way was fairly steep downwards at the start but since that time the tunnel has risen back to the level of the cavern and more i judge let us go a little farther yet suggested ecgbryt it may descend yet again there is nothing lost if we be wrong nothing but time said swigar and that is something in limited supply it may go farther down yet but another path may be better i think we should return to the cavern and do what try another tunnel ecgbryt responded his voice rising which of those was more promising than this perhaps said swigar uncomfortably we could go a small way into each onea short distance and follow the one most likely but time presses swigar ecgbryt said in a mocking tone we will get nowhere by traveling short distances whos to know that the tunnels dont all meet up farther on down let us press on swigar didnt move he just glowered at ecgbryt wisdom dictates that we stop and consider before oh yes wise swigar and his dictates you speak out of turn broor then kindly inform each of us when our turn arrives so we may speak then daniel and freya stood along one wall gripping their lanterns and watching the knights argue with wide eyes daniel looked at the gnomes and would have laughed if he werent so afraid almost a hundred wide and fearful eyes were looking at the knights like frightened islanders would look at a hurricane swigars jaw clenched have your say he growled we have barely even started down this route ecgbryt said his voice steady the lad is right let us just follow it a little farther there was a heavy silence as the knights glared at each other i agree with swigar freya announced i think we should she stopped abruptly when ecgbryt turned his face on her his eyes blazing angrily i do too said daniel stepping forward to stand beside freya but i agree more with ecgbryt he said turning to swigar anyhow i dont see why we have to have it just one way lets just go a little farther and if it still doesnt look good then we can turn back that way were all satisfied yeah ecgbryt dipped his eyes and looked away swigar stroked his beard and freya moved a trembling hand across her hot face we can still have it both ways its just that we cant know if this tunnel is right if we turn back now swigar gave a curt nod very well he conceded turning to the gnomes you are welcome to join us but you are not bound all of the tiny eyes stared blinking ah yes said the chief nervously we would gladly join you but if its all the same we wont still he said trying to sound hearty raising his hands he declared may your legs move merrily along your whatyoumaycallit and may your feet never want for thingy and all that right okay he said turning come along lads the gnomes turned quickly and bustled off back up the tunnel carrying their lantern with them as the travelers resumed their journey in sullen silence they soon noticed the texture of the walls change from a crumbly black surface to a soft lumpy white one it looks like chalk said freya aye so it is answered swigar this was the first exchange in some time and it died in silence whats happening up there daniel asked does the tunnel just end it might just be a turn or something freya said because of the white walls the light cast by the lamps was brighter and went farther but it still was only a few more steps until they saw that the tunnel did in fact come to a dead end well thats that said daniel under his breath now we know he turned and tried to avoid swigars eye wait look said freya that edge up there look theres something on the other side the girls right ecgbryt said stepping towards what looked like a depression in the wall once his torch shone across it however it was revealed to be a hole large enough for him to put first his torch and then his head through it standing on his toes and pulling himself up with his free hand he examined the opening for a moment before pulling himself out it appears to lead to the floor of another chamber he reported i see a lot of walls and entrances i think we should investigate it swigar said nothing but stood pulling at his beard doubtfully take a look for yourself at least ecgbryt suggested swigar stepped forward and examined the hole in the same way very well he agreed reluctantly let one of us go first and then the elingas ecgbryt was lofting his gear and weaponry through the hole before swigar had even finished talking with difficulty and some widening of the chalk hole ecgbryt pushed through and was able to reach down to pull daniel and freya up as well looking around they saw that they were in the corner of what looked to be a gridlike construction of tunnelsor rather one wideopen space that was supported by many thick columns of white rock i believe this may be a mine much of the island is rich in good quality chalk such as this daniel considered a mine but i thought that we were going through the wild cavesnot anything made by men swigar nodded and so we have been until now these caves were not made by britons though but by the men of rome and possibly the celts before them still said freya we cant be that far from the surface can we we will have to see but my fear is that we are straying from our true course so little faith have you swigar said ecgbryt you must trust more to fortuneit has been on our side yet swigars face went slightly dark and then cleared again nevertheless he said if you dont think it mocking fate i would like to mark our exit ecgbryt shrugged and hoisted his pack using the butt of his spear to scrape into the soft stone swigar made large xs on the walls above the hole they gathered their things and started exploring the new tunnels they walked for some time but arrived nowhere each section of the tunnel was the same as the last a short corridor leading to a perpendicular crossroads always carved out of white powdery rock eventually their path ended in a wall so they turned and walked along that for a while when that ended after a short distance so they went in another direction freyas eyes were starting to water from the dust clouding up from their steps and from the endless repetition eventually they decided to stop at a crossroads and rest the light from the torches did not reflect off any wall down either end as far as they could see frustrated they sat together not saying a word or even looking at each other daniel finished massaging his feet and very carefully put his socks back on he drank some water and lay back on the cold floor willing his muscles to relax it was as he closed his eyes and let his mind drift that he felt something on the back of his heada dull vibration that came from the ground a kind of pounding and scraping he opened his eyes none of the others were doing anything to create the strange sensation he was feeling he strained his ears to listen trying to separate sounds away from each other then realised that he wasnt listening to one sound but to lots of the same sound the feeling of dread swept over him everyone quiet he whispered i think its yfelgopes all held their breath swigar and ecgbryt stood quietly drawing their weapons soon they heard the sound of footstepsmany footsteps a flickering light grew around them daniel stood up and took a few steps down the tunnel he guessed what the source of the light was before he saw itit was another lamp in the deep blue glow they glimpsed a shape which they quickly recognised more gnomes for a dizzy moment daniel thought that it might be the gegan clanwhom they had somehow circled around to meet again but the light of their own torches soon revealed a fatter swarthier gnome with different clothes and hair daniel took a deep breath and stepped forward hello he said and introduced himself halloo hail and well met welcome pleased ta meetcha hello said the rotund figure at the head our name is ergan greetings to you friend gnome swigar said coming to stand beside daniel the gnome gaped up at the knightmany times taller than heand blinked rapidly are youdo you have two cousins asked freya the gnome turned his eyes to her and seemed to ponder the question there was a confused muttering behind him yes we believe we do gegan and negan are kinsmen of mine have you met them ecgbryt snorted and nodded his head for all the good its done us yes said freya we have they are silly folk said ergan one of them wont go anywhere and the other tries to go everywhere at once so they end up nowhere yes said daniel exactly when really continued ergan obviously pleased at the reception he was getting it doesnt matter where you go so long as you go somewhere right said daniel exactly listen we are searching for the entrance to the slpismere do you know where that is oh said ergan slowly i think we do that is we must dowe have walked these tunnels long enough let us see let us see we shall consult the maps bring the maps there was a chorus of bring the maps and after some bustling several bundles of scrolledup parchment were produced the lamp was turned up to give enough light to read by and the four travelers could see that they were now in the company of a much more sophisticated type of gnome these seemed much more prepared than any of the others some of them were wearing metal helmets and had coils of rope across their shoulders there was a call for more light and candles were produced at last said ecgbryt excitedly we can move onwards i thought that we were moving onwards broor swigar jibed ecgbryt glowered for lack of a leader he said we were simply movingor drifting rather rudderless directionless so you disregard my advice and claim that you had no direction swigar charged his voice rising ecgbryt batted the question away with a flip of his hand bah he is starting to sound like ealdstan he muttered to himself bending over the maps that the gnomes were spreading out swigars teeth clenched he folded his arms across his chest and turned away ah here we are announced ergan we havent come across the slpismere yet but we know several places where it could be show us said ecgbryt bending over show him commanded ergan with a signal instantly four gnomes sprang forward and pointed fingers at different points on several of the scrolls that had been unrolled before them the lowest points of the tunnel weve found are here here and here he explained found on maps and e however none of those tunnels diverge and at no point are any of the tunnels crossed by any streams or tributaries ergan paused as swigar and freya joined them to look over the mapwork however the gnome chief continued however ah do you know in which direction this slpismere lies swigar shook his head pity said ergan because that would have helped us narrow it down you see there are as yet at least one hundred and thirtyfour unexplored branches and divergences all of the rest of the gnomes reached into their satchels pulled out unrolled maps and waved them in the air swigar sighed and removed his helmet daniel and freya watched him run a hand several times across his head this is what you do swigar asked you search through the tunnels and make maps of them all of the gnomes heads began nodding furiously yes said ergan proudly that is what we do how long have you been doing this asked freya every shoulder of every gnome shrugged once ergan shrugged too years and years maybe a hundred since i was this high he placed his hand at his waist roughly twelve inches from the ground and not once have you discovered the slpismere or imagined where it might lie ergan shook his head no we cant say that we have what have you discovered tunnels squealed ergan delightedly several gnomes behind him echoed the word in a happy fashion lots and lots of glorious tunnels every one of them a marvel dont you find them simply fantastic how many people have wandered these tunnels over the years who made them what stories do they have to tell why when we think of how much there still is to do it makes our hearts ache so much to look forward to and so much that we may not live to see still at least future generations will be able to enjoy the benefits of our work and go wherever they want whenever they want youdo you not think that grand ergan faltered when he realised that the look on the companions harrowed faces was anger dangerously mixed with a little fear what squeaked ergan whatever is the matter i think i understand said ecgbryt calmly drawing his axe hold by gnome i am a master axeman and this will be done quickly he took a couple steps towards the small figure what are you going to do asked freya since we cannot coax the direction we need from them i am going to peel the chiefs skin back and see if it lies inside of him and if not him then ill try the next ill unravel every last one of them if i have to unpleasant work certainly but i am resolved to it the gnomes faces blanched in terror their eyes staring from their round heads there were many confused cries and shouts a dozen hands were placed on ergan and with a chorus of voices yelling save the chief they fled back down the tunnel the light from their lantern bobbed in the darkness when they could be seen no longer and then it too disappeared ecgbryt was laughing as he sheathed his sword that was mean said freya and pointless said swigar but hilarious exploded daniel aye the boy has me said ecgbryt it was all for the look on their funny little faces but now we are worse off than before said swigar gravely ecgbryt shrugged perhaps no we arent worse off said daniel in fact were better all those gnomes were just confusing us and i think they were meant to what if this is a trap of some kind were probably meant to wander around forever and become just as confused as those gnomes we have to go back to the big caverni think theres something weve missed swigar frowned what you say may be true but then again it may be that the path lies some farther distance up and we do not know it yet of course said daniel but i dont think so remember what ealdstan said gad would want to make sure that he could get to his heart quickly if he needed to so the hiding place wouldnt be too far away besides those gnomes have been wandering everywhere and havent found a thing no we went wrong at the start of this somehow a riddle ecgbryt exclaimed gleefully rubbing his hands together now my blood is running and my feet shall go no slower come elingas i wist you will have a job to keep up daniel and ecgbryt virtually leapt back down the way they had come with freya and swigar trailing behind them but after a few steps she hesitated and stopped wanting to turn to swigar who she knew was still standing there unhappily she decided not to in the end thinking it might embarrass him instead she spent an extra long time adjusting her pack behind her swigar said something she didnt understand and then there came a crash a smash and a rattling clatter as the lanterns bounced into the darkness it startled her but she hid this by hiking her pack up onto her shoulders then swigar passed her with his enormous strides and she hurried to catch up to him they made their way back to the big cavern the journey was uneventful and embarrassing and bad feelings still hung in the air freya only hoped that they could solve the riddle quickly so that they could get on with their journey and put the unpleasantness behind them after a time they were able to see the purple glow of gegans lamp through the worming tunnel they unslung their packs when they came to the mining camp and stood a fair ways off from the static gnome chief and his orbiting clansmen so what are we looking for freya daniel asked were underneath britain wedged between solid rockit has to be a tunnel we have plenty of tunnels but we think that theyre here to distract us so maybe its a tunnel that doesnt look like a tunnel a hidden tunnel freya nodded lets start looking the two of them and after a short time the knights also began hunting around the abandoned campsite daniel was searching the rack of lamps again to see if it concealed a hidden doorway when taking a step back his calf bumped against a gnome startled he flinched away and let out a surprised grunt there were not one but four gnomes standing at his feet i nearly trod on you daniel said what are you doing here the gnomes just stood looking up at him freya ecgbryt he called they turned to him and bumped into gnomes of their own swigar almost squashed one completely except that he shifted his foot at the last instant what do you want freya asked the gnomes they just stood looking vacantly up at her guys she asked nervously whats going on daniel and the two knights had begun to draw away from the corners they had been hunting in to stand closer together and the gnomes followed their footsteps are you trying to help us freya asked her gnomes bending forward slightly as she slowly edged towards the others are you trying to stop us the gnomes said nothing just kept following freya joined the others who were trying to gently push the gnomes away with their feet she looked up to the rest of the gegan clan and saw that more gnomes were leaving the group and wandering towards them except for two two of them were heading towards the well it all clicked into place for her at that moment the gegan gnomes chief did know where the exit was and while its main thought was to keep them away it couldnt help also thinking about what it was keeping them away fromwhich was the well another tunnel hidden but in plain sight freya nudged daniel and pointed he looked at it for a moment before his eyes grew wide and a smile flashed across his face they silently communicated to the two knights and they pushed through the growing circle of gnomes and collected their packs they brushed aside the gnomes that were clinging to them or who had climbed on top of them they had just turned towards the well when they heard where are you going where are you going stay here stay away from there get ready boys they paused instantly and then swigar said let us be swift elingasthe gnomes are starting to turn do they know theyve twigged it but do they know theyve figured it out get them as one the gnomes leapt forward gripping at their legs and climbing upwards run shouted ecgbryt booting a gnome halfway across the encampment daniel and freya struggled forward trying to shake the gnomes off of them it was hard work as their little pudgy hands gripped their clothes tenaciously slow them down weigh them down stab them slit their throats at these alarming cries one of the gnomes that had swung onto freyas sleeve produced a knife from its belt its blade was only two inches long but it looked very very sharp whipping her arm away she sent it flying just as she heard daniel cry out he reached down and clawed a gnome off of his shin and threw it away from him more and more of the gnomes were producing knives the well bristled with them now the whole rest of the clan of gnomes was now lining its rim waiting for them daniel had an idea though and glanced across to the gnome chieftain still atop the rock near his the purple lantern he was standing hands clenched at his sides glaring at them in anger but there were no gnomes around him and none between the two of them daniel saw his chance and jumped towards the chief clearing the heads of several gnomes around him the gnomes were fast and energetic but no match for a boy running at top speed in any case it was only a dozen steps before daniel had reached him during that time he had shaken the gnomes from him and drawn his sword no stop him help dont please mercy biting down on his lip daniel brought his sword down and cleaved through gegan the chief gnome the sword entered the gnomes shoulder and sunk to his belly a second later the small rotund little creature was dead the gnomes exploded into a frenzy the ones that were on either the knights or freya let go and fell to the ground the gnomes lining the well ran all different directions bumping into each other and falling in and off the well itself they scattered screaming and wailing into the darkness soon they were gone from sight wincing and trying not to vomit daniel shook the dead body of the gnome off of his sword it fell to the ground with a plop that was fast thinking daniel ecgbryt said well done you gave me the idea for it daniel said wiping his sword with a bit of his leather coat and sheathing it again lets move on swigar said before the ergan gnomes come back chapter eleven the faerie fayre now daniel awoke just as the skywhere he could see it between the billows of the smoking woodpileswas just starting to lighten and the stars had begun to fade finally his body was adjusting to the incredibly long days during the night the collier had extinguished the fires and was breaking open the first mound he had paused in his task and was resting his hands on his shovel his lips moving as if he were talking to someone as daniel watched him rubbing the sleep out of his eyes he thought he saw a shadow standing before the collier which was roughly the size of a person the collier stood as if listening now and then inclined his head and raised his arm in a farewell the shadow evaporated and the collier turned back to his work daniel sipped some water from a bowl taken from the cistern and relieved himself behind the hut after taking a sip from the breakfast bottle and ignoring the gnawing pit of hunger in his stomach he picked up a shovel and went to join the collier they shared a good morning nod my wife will be here perhaps this afternoon the collier announced daniel was surprised he hadnt considered that the collier might be married is that who you were talking to daniel asked where is she now not far off i instructed her to bring food and she says she has managed to find some oh thank you so much if she was closer would she have been clearer you could not see her clearly discern her features no she just looked like a shadow to me the collier grunted little matter he said after a time are you ready now to help sort ready and willing daniel said with a smile they worked in silence during one of their breaks towards noon the colliers wife arrived she was leading a horse and cart and seemed to daniel to be fairly old with grey hair and a graciously wrinkled face but her eyes and skin gleamed with a youthful sheen her movements quick and graceful she was willowthin and dressed in a bodice and skirt made up of many different layers of thin coloured cloth her hair was braided around the crown in a crescent shape and cascaded down her back to her waist as the sunlight filtered into the clearing daniel thought it almost glowed hello husband she said dropping the horses rein and dashing up to him he gathered her in his long knotty arms and held her close ive missed you the colliers wifes eyes then swept over daniel who is your new helper she asked i do not know his name the collier said but i have known him to be a good worker this past ten day the young marrey lad sent him tch the woman said in a chiding tone still looking at daniel imagine not knowing a fellow workers name in all that time but thats my kyle daniel shot the collierkylean inquisitive look and you havent told him yours it seems ill never understand men though i live to be a hundred thousand my name is pettyl she said giving a slight curtsey im daniel he explained where he had come from and that he was trying to get back so pettyl said when he had finished why dont you two work a spell longer and ill fix lunch daniel and kyle returned to the first pile and continued sifting and sorting into the barrels lunch for daniel was the food that pettyl had brought with herfresh fruits and nuts that daniel had never seen before he tried not to eat too much too quickly and stopped when he felt his stomach start to ache the fruit he enjoyed most was purple and curved like a banana but wider and flatter with a thin skin that could be eaten and soft juicy flesh like a grapefruit he thanked pettyl profusely afterwards they toiled late into the evening and with pettyls help they managed to finish packing the charcoal kyle announced that they would depart for the market at the break of the next day daniel ate a hearty supper of more fruits and nuts and fell asleep with the satisfaction of a hard job finished he awoke the next morning aching as he always did since coming to elfland but still exhausted unrefreshed by his sleep which was odd since he had slept the entire night through the horses had already been hitched to pettyls cart which was larger than the one the collier used for moving wood around and kyle had loaded the barrels of charcoal stacking them two high lashing them to the sides of the cart with rope the sky was still not fully bright when they were ready to start off kyle and pettyl sat in the front of the cart on the driving seat daniel made a place next to the provisions box and atop the bundle of cloth that would become their trade tent when everyone was settled kyle announced i will ask the forest for a good road to the market kyle faced the forest and began to sing it was a song with no words or at least none that daniel understood it started low in kyles chest and grew into a reverberation that came from nowhere and everywhere then his call began to rise and fall in soaring major notes and falling minors before eventually settling into a repetitious melody the trees before kyle swayed and shifted making way for the cart in a way that made daniels head spinthey seemed to be moving but not moving like they were shifting place into somewhere they had always been finally the tune began to break down devolving into disparate notes and phrases that were common to the piece and then it was over dumb with awe daniel leaned back against a barrel as kyle took his seat and with a snap of the reins the cart jerked off it felt as if his insides were still quivering like chords on a harp that still held their notes daniel remained in this dreamlike state for a long time into their journey before realising that the road that was stretching out behind him was very wide level and straight it must have been a pretty good song freya woke up with a queasy feeling in her stomach her body evidently realising that she was awake hit her with a full blast of nausea alarmed she swung herself out of bed and lurched to the toilet where she was immediately sick she caressed her swollen belly as she spat into the bowl and wiped the corners of her mouth with a couple squares of toilet paper she couldnt help glancing as she flushedwhy was there always so little what was her body doing throwing up what wasnt there to throw up she grabbed her dressing gown leaving it undone of course she hadnt been able to draw it together for a couple weeks nowand padded into the kitchen hello sweetie felix said he was seated at the kitchen table a mug of coffee in his hand the morning paper spread in front of him a welcome and comforting stereotype she thought she smiled at him and went to the refrigerator do we have bacon i feel like bacon toastno a bagel if weve got onemarmalade and mustard lots of mustard with the bacon obviously dijon preferably felix chuckled okay my little gastronome have a seat ill whip you up something freya lowered herself into one of their kitchen chairs shifting her weight uncomfortably i heard you in there felix said as strips of bacon hissed in the frying pan how are you feeling today about average this coffees helping i hope youre not drinking ityoull get one of your headaches no i just like the smell she spent a few moments in thought do i have an appointment today yes you do leigh was kind enough to offer to take you remember thats right in fact felix glanced at the clock on the wall oh dear he said gravely youre running late i let you oversleep im sorry quick go get changed and ill have this ready for you when youre done sighing freya hoisted herself up as she passed the kitchen counter she reached a hand out to take a scrap of bacon but received a slap on the wrist instead naughty felix said with a grin stomach growling angrily freya went back into their bedroom and dressed putting on the minimum of makeup there was a knock on the door just as she was finishing her eyeliner she heard felix open it and the murmur of voices greeting each other freya coming freya shouted she stood straight and looked at herself in the mirror when did she become so old as she bustled down the hallway a wave of dizziness hit her she slowed as she reached the doorway and put a hand against the wall to steady herself are you okay stowe asked im fine just stood up too fast thats all hello leigh you look lovely as ever thank you well wed better get moving ill see you this evening my love felix said giving her a peck on the cheek as he helped her into her coat okay bye it was only as freya was getting into leigh sintons car that she realised she hadnt had anything to eat dont worry dear the older woman said we can pick something up on the way back its been awhile since we had a good chat how are you coming on brize nortons commentaries to the names of the guardians by the way i dont know im a little hazy it is difficult i agree

another these are the names of the guardians of knowledge hanamiem tusemptoulous alsanaz moem noetinous these are the names of those who stand at rest before them teitauem aufaem leigh freya said

herself nodding again she felt so tired these days something to ask the doctor about her head reclined back on the chairs headrest and she closed her eyes and drifted away the journey through the forest took them three days during the first night when daniel was curled up in the back of the cart just on the edge of drifting off to sleep he heard someone call his name so loudly and so clearly that he jerked around and sat up staring into the darkness for some time hardly daring to breathe daniel he would have answered but the voice was clearly unmistakably freyas kyle and pettyl were huddled close together on the seat up front they had obviously not heard anything out of the ordinary daniel lay back down but didnt sleep he was feeling tiredand more than tired weak he was obviously malnourished and kept thinking back to the stone that kay marrey had given him that he had foolishly let drop in the forest on the first night perhaps that contained minerals that he needed well maybe hed find something to replace it at the fayreor better yet a way home they made good time it would seem since they traveled during the night daniel didnt know how they or the horses could still see the road but he imagined that their elf senses were equal to the task kyle and pettyl took turns driving allowing the other to sleepstretching out in the back of the cart while daniel rode up front the only rest off the road they took was for the horses when they needed to be fed daniel enjoyed the journey the movements of the cart though not always gentle were comforting and the shifting green treescape was like a tonic for his soul it was three long days of calm and peace and the last of that for a long time afterwards he came to know pettyl better she was very talkative and told him stories of elfland and histories of the forest in particular tales of the birds that daniel found especially compelling on the afternoon of the second day daniel heard freya call his name again as they stopped to feed the horses daniel he was drinking a hot tealike drink that pettyl had made and nearly spilled it all over himself when he leapt off of the stone that he sat on daniel pettyl said are you alright im fine its just a little hot he said holding out the tin cup he sat back down and drank trying to hide his anxiousness it sounded like freya needed him and badly and so it was that they came to the lowlands and joined a road that kyle had not asked for and so they left the forest but not before kyle gave a song of thanks to the forest for what it had provided them this last leg of the trip was a short one but fascinating for they now traveled along a road that was intermittently cobbled and well worn the landscape was open and the strange distortion of distance meant that daniel was able to see miles farther than he could in his own world giving views of hilly farmlands where houses of bulbous design constructed from white carved stone and wood dotted the landscape who lives in those daniel asked pettyl no one very much i should think answered pettyl many of these are now abandoned since the nine princes gained rule of the kingdom some of the farmers have been chased off some killed and some dead in the wars the widows and daughters will have worked the farms for a short time and then dispersed to wherever their relatives were still livingor to become married elsewhere thats too bad daniel said gazing glumly at one of the odd structures not long after they passed through an entire elfin village similarly deserted there were only a dozen or so buildings but they were magnificent they were carved out of the same white stone as the farm buildings and the shapesunlike niergeards which were all lines ridges and archeswere organic as if they had grown like shells to house strange enormous creatures but they were old and decaying roofs and walls had collapsed and spilled out into the streets allowing a view of the rooms inside which looked like honeycombs no less organic than the exterior this place was beautiful once pettyl said we came here often being the nearest settlement the spires and edifices were decorated with flags and banners of every colour under the sun banquets and parties were common for the elffolk in these parts love a festival above all else and make it the chief aim of all their work there are twentyseven grand festivals in the rural elfs calendar and any number of lesser local ones the feast hall over therepettyl pointed to a large amphitheater structure that had a wooden roof on it that had partially collapsedheld most of the festivities when the weather was inclement other times marquees would be raised and bonfires built it was customary to visit other villages during local celebrations so that elves from hundreds of miles around would come to know each other enjoy each other love each other pettyls voice trailed off the cart rattled on through the dead streets and soon the village was behind them where are we going daniel asked where is the market held is it in a city no but it will seem like a village if one made of tents and booths it is a gathering placea very old one it is near a large standing stone which marks the confluence of several counties and has been a festival site for many generations in times past it used to be a station on the kings circuithe would visit once a year and dispense justice to those who gathered there obviously that doesnt happen anymore the princes sometimes keep this custom but if they do it is only to revel when was the last time you were here on market day last season their path joined a wider road and daniel could see another cart this one covered some distance ahead of them and after cresting a hill and looking down upon a shallow valley more wagons ahead of that the traders were coming to market a procession of riders on magnificent horses passed them first came what daniel assumed were guardsthey were dressed in leathers stained stained forest green and wore armour made of silver each carried a long spear that was tipped with a head of bronze then came a young noble and his lady he was dressed in blue and purple garmentsa large flowing cloak heavy waistcoat and trousers that ended at his knees where long riding boots began he wore a widebrimmed hat with long feathers of purple and black behind him riding sidesaddle in a dress made up of layers of green silk and velvet was a beautiful young woman she also wore a large hat with black and green feathers unlike the elfin gentleman there were little silver bells attached to her clothes gloves saddle and bridle which jingled softly like wind chimes when the horse pranced past the riders passed by without a word being said on either side and eventually disappeared into the road ahead who were they daniel asked just travelers a lord and lady by the look of it kyle remarked tersely they were passed by another elf on horseback this one dressed in clothing that was quite hard to make out since it was completely covered with brightly coloured ribbons of varying lengths his hat was squat and had streamers erupting from the top of it all this was dazzling but that was nothing compared to the elfs smile which was like a blazing sunbeam when he flashed it in daniels direction good day to you collier kyle greeted the rider there was a large instrument rather like an oversized cello lashed to his saddle the neck of which was wide fretted and extended above his head good day awin kaayn responded the collier where will you be performing this market in the usual placethe common courtexcept for this evening when i will be entertaining the elfin prince lhiamlhiat in the feast hall is he one of the nine daniel asked pettyl in a low voice but loud enough that the musician heard him aye he is the brightly costumed faerie said the secondeldest of the nine great rulers do you want to meet him he asked with a sly grin would i be allowed all things can happen for a price i dont have any money daniel stopped talking as the collier placed a hand on his knee this act was not unnoticed by the minstrel who merely continued to smile wryly all of us are given great treasures at birth that may be negotiated and bartered with do you have an artists eye what good is it to you if you dont use ityou might enjoy having a musical ear instead so why not trade it why hold on to your dancers toe if you never exercise it better to have a hounds nose or the tongue of the birds nearly every virtue is saleableas are all of the vices except for onedo you know what that is daniel didnt respond but awin kaayn seemed determined to wait for an answer so he shook his head greed youll never find anyone willing to part with it he laughed merrily at his joke kyle and pettyl frowned and continued looking stonily at the road well the minstrel said evidently knowing when a crowd had turned sour ill be off find me at the fayre young master kaayn said to daniel and ill play a song just for you and with a final flash of his smile the minstrel spurred his horse and galloped on ahead disappearing from sight a few minutes later around a bend in the road it will go better kyle said to daniel after a time if you allow me to deal for you at the fayre or you will find return to your own world quite beyond your means nothing more was said and no other travelers greeted until the fayre was finally visible there were indeed tents and booths set up into the hundreds and some were well over two storeys and made of many different composite parts the booths were generally cubic and regularly spaced the tents above them were of variable heights and sometimes spanned multiple booths all were festooned with bright flags and banners embroidered with symbols of their trade freestanding tents were often erected in complex starshaped patterns layered on top of each other sprouting other tents out of their sides and sometimes out of their tops daniel wondered if they actually had different floors in them some of them seemed as big as hotels the people were no less strange and vibrant all of them were dressed in such dazzling colours and fabrics that daniel nearly became hypnotized by the evershifting crowd more than a few nobles were swanning about in clothes decorated with glittering metals and stones due to the size of kyles wagon they were made to circumnavigate the fayre in order to reach the area where the collier would set up his stall this was in a lower part of the site which was already quite muddy and where elves dressed in less ostentatious outfits seemed to be engaged in bartering for livestock or food stock the collier hopped down from the cart and led the horses by their bridles to a large authoritarian figure whom the chaotic swarm of workmen seemed to orbit they exchanged a few words and daniel saw the rotund elf point towards a bank of flimsy structures that some worker elves were attempting to erect kyle led the cart to their designated booth which was little more than three flimsy walls that reminded daniel of the fencing around his garden when he was young there was also a large central post that rose from a hole in the middle of the site which leaned at a disconcerting angle as daniel helped pettyl unload some of the smaller barrels packed with charcoal kyle went to borrow some tools from the workers he returned with a mallet and some wooden pegs which he hammered into the ground alongside the walls and central posts in order to more firmly anchor them it was the work of a moment and made the thin panels sturdy and upright then they set up their stall pettyl took the job of raising the tent as the other two unloaded the large barrels of charcoal daniel watched pettyl scale the central pole gripping a loop of string that she tied at the top and used to hoist the canopy which was green and grey those are the colours of our trade pettyl explained when asked red and yellow are the goldsmiths white and grey the silversmiths brown and black the bronzesmiths white with black and red feathers is the fletchers yellow and orange the brewers and so on you will soon learn them what about the he didnt know the word in elfish so he used the englishblacksmiths he was interested in what elfish weapons were to be had what colour is that red and black what is a blacksmiths she asked unpacking and smoothing down the surface of a long banner someone who shapes um steel daniel replied an ironmonger he drew his sword and tapped it pettyl twitched as if shocked put that away let none see it she whispered harshly hidden prince she said as an oath if i had known that all this time yougood elves have no need for such a thing she exclaimed what do you use for swords and tools bronze is good as is brass or any number of mixed metals some swords are even made from stone but those are expensive and rarethe art to wright those is being lost she frowned steel is a cold hateful metal and iron is downright heartless it houses none of the passion that the warm metals keep it despises our flesh and corrupts it we have no dealings with it daniel sheathed his sword again this information sparked a train of thought he now recalled vaguely that iron was tied up with elfish lore and myths somehow there was iron in his blood he knew maybe they didnt have any inside them but did they get any of it in their diet had he been getting any of it in his diet maybe that was why he was feeling so fatigued what would happen if he never got it would he die when will i be able to talk to someone who can send me back home daniel asked the collier and his wife once the shop had been completely set up daniel was impressed various streamers and flags had been arranged to make a compelling pattern sawdust had been strewn all about the ground so that it was dry and clean and a long banner with the colours of their trade and an elfish script describing their name had been fixed to a pole a little distance away from the tent closer to the general flow of elves walking within the fayre that is best done soon the collier said pettyl will mind the stall now you come with me the two followed a wide path that took them into the heart of the fayre where a group of more interesting and esoteric stalls stood they passed cloth merchants selling clothes with fantastically woven patterns and pictures smaller vendors offered strange foods calling out their names roc eggs christians delight old mans temptation something called snakes hoofs suckling roasted carbuncles spiced mandrake root and more besides there were drinks and potions also honeymooners mead red absinthe sweet milk moly tea and wines and cordial made of fruits and berries daniel had never heard of before then they came to a part of the fayre that sold charms and trinketstable upon table of bright dazzling pieces of metal and stonework as well as vials containing potions and elixirs the rule for the forest goes the same hereperhaps more so lest you be trapped here permanently touch nothing daniel kept his hands in his pockets but took in all he could with his eyes there was a banner outside one blueandblack tent that caught daniels attentionhe couldnt read what it said but it bore shapes that apparently represented different realms because one of them was shaped exactly like great britain alex inspected the wound at his side it wasnt much it didnt look as if he would need stitches he went towards the dead dragon and started to work his sword out of it that was a good upwards swing he complimented maccanish and well placed thank you im a keen golfer what do we do with the body whatever you like although its not going to be around for long the natural chemicals it makes in order to spit fire are highly corrosive itll be a pile of sludge by nightfall unless you know the proper way of removing them look seethe head is already decaying alex finally managed to pull his blade free he inspected it apart from being covered in acidic dragons blood it seemed none the worse for wear it needed a good cleaning luckily he had an alkali solution wash in his land rover remarkable what about the trolls again whatever you please leave them here or call the royal society of anthropology thatd give them a fright i always wondered what would happen if someone did that in any case my work here is finished you had bigger problems than i thought if you had a dragon move in here so what does that mean maccanish asked they stepped outside and stood in the caves mouth what does that mean for the valley for our troubles well youll be back to being able to sleep for a start people will be less inclined to evil deeds and the feeling of dread and oppression will be lifted but people will still be hurt and theyll still be frightened as they wont understand or allow themselves to understand what has happened itll be your job to help them through that you need to keep an eye out though if the people hereabouts slide back into despair these things and more could come back keep an eye out and ill give you a number where i can be contacted but you can give thanks now that you have been delivered from evil alex stuck out his hand and i can give thanks that youve kept such an excellent golfing form maccanish smiled and shook daniels hand what are you going to do now maccanish asked theres one more thing that i need to check on you go on back thanks again for your help thank you rector john maccanish started off back down morven as alex watched him go he heard the man begin to sing a hymn as the clouds finally opened and released a gentle rain upon the mountain and its plain alex went back into the cave he broke another glow stick and clipped it next to the other which was dimming he hung his sword by its hilt onto a carabiner on his belt it bumped comfortingly against him as he walked there would be no more danger herehe was no longer on alert instead he tried to get himself in the right frame of mind doing the mental exercises his father taught himand walked farther into the tunnel he stepped cautiously over the body of the dragon and then those of the trolls he turned the corner and passed the dragons pile of shiny lootits bedding then he came to a chiseled stone wall made of square onefootbyonefoot blocks and about as high and wide as a standard doorway alex put his hands up against it and cleared his mind thinking only of being between he had no intents or aims in life he was open to all options he was standing at the crossing of all paths he visualized this last thought as standing in a country road with signs pointing in all directions it took a few moments before he felt his hands sinking into the stone it was harder now that he was older and had a purpose in life but his heart and soul were still open to new callings once his arms were through the stone it was easy he visualized himself being between the stones now he stepped forward and with a sensation like moving through water he was through and into the hidden chamber of morven it was much like the others he had been in a simple octagonal room with a ceiling perhaps lower than others silver lamps lined the walls throwing their ancient light on the stone plinths and the eight sleepers that lay on them except that these warriors were no longer sleepingthey were dead they had been dressed in full plaids and sporrans and had been armed with twohanded claymore swords and sgian dubhs but now their corpses were mangled eviscerated pickedover flesh had been torn from bone joints separated and the pieces scattered it had been a onesided slaughter looking at the centre of the chamber he saw the fragments of the stonecoloured oblong egg that the dragon had hatched from it had been easy to see what had happened as the infant dragon hatched and fed first on one body and then the next probably over the course of a couple weeks maybe more the trolls attracted to the area by its atmosphere of evil had set up in the cave and it had killed them too as lucky as he was to escape with his life it was a marvelous stroke of fortunefor him and the entire countrythat alex had come across the dragon now while it was still an infant and not a fully grown adult but who placed the egg here across the chamber the wall which was supposed to be enchanted like the one he had passed through had been torn downor rather knocked through its stones lay strewn across the floor a hand clamped around alexs foot and he started he swallowed and looked down in horrorone of the dead bodies arms was gripping his boot it was connected to a shoulder a torso a head and nothing else the mangled face of the highlander moved and alex heard the words in gaelic fuasgail sinne release us the spirits of the dead men were still in their bodiesthey had not been released from their contract of immortality yet they had lain here all this time waiting for the battle and for them the fight had never come only a painful prolonged death with a lump in his throat alex pulled his foot gently out of the knights hold and strode to the wall where the horn was hanging he blew a strong note on it and the air seemed to grow warmer a wind moved through the tunnel with a sound like a sigh of relief for a moment there appeared before alexs eyes the silvery outline of a man in old highland gear with a gleaming sword in his hand buidheachas the figure said looking alex in the eye slainte agadsa alex replied slan leat the apparition smiled and then faded the lamplight returned to its full brightness and the chamber was still alex set about rearranging the bodies on the stone slabs as best he couldthere would be no more honourable burial place than this cavern where the lights would burn for all time it was gruesome work but after a while he managed to place the bodies and weapons in respectful order he stood for a time looking at the torndown wall and wondered who had made it and where they had come from the largest part of him wanted to follow it and track down whoever had done this but he knew that wasnt the prudent thing to do instead he left back through the wall he had entered by went through the cave and stepped into the open stilldrizzling air as he walked down the mount and back to his rover he pulled his phone from his pocket and rang his associate after relaying what had occurred omitting no detail his associate said the bleed has startedbut it is hard to tell the extent even yet we must go to niergeardthat is where we will find answers chapter twelve quick blood before i dont understand said freya what should we be looking at a vast underground lake nearly big enough to be called a seaits surface completely smooth and still for no creature stirs it nor the slightest breeze moves across it but not thisthis dark emptiness swigar took several steps forward and descended down a sandandstone slope which ended after several feet in a flat black dry cracked mud floor its gone the slpismere is gone he exclaimed in a harsh whisper what does that mean freya asked it means that the hidden world is already feeling the affect of evil spreading in this land swigar answered they have already started claiming victoriesdecay has set in this is why our task is of such import whats that asked daniel pointing along the dry bank there was some sort of wall that extended into the empty lake they walked over and investigated it is a pier said ecgbryt as their torches revealed it more in detail on the far end several wide flatbottomed boats dangled lengthways from a chain that was still attached to a metal pillar swigar gave one of them a push and it gave a couple tragicomic swings before scraping to a halt well lets get started said ecgbryt we must go on if we are to keep the pace walking along the dry lake bed was much easier than picking their way along the rocky tunnels now above them the ground was basically flat sloping gently downwards did i ever tell you said ecgbryt of the fight we had with the danes off the isle of wight a glorious battle i arrived in one of the nine new ships built in the northmans fashion that lfred ordered built along with many of the frisian warriors that fought with us on that occasion have i ever told you about the fearsome frisians are they still as famed in this day as they were in ours i remember a ballad about them that starts thus ecgbryt recited his ballad and then continued his long monologue about his battle and almost every ballad he knew relating to it it soothed them all to listen and ecgbryt to talk when he stopped they took a break to rest and thats when daniel moving away from the torchlight to relieve himself noticed a light shining up ahead does anybody else see that he asked i think that its on top of something freya said i think that theres a hill up ahead they had been walking an upward slope after having journeyed quite a long way down into the dry lake bed no not a hill ecgbryt said not a hill exactlyits an island the weary travelers circled the dry island to find an easy way up that didnt involve scaling sharp rocks and boulders the ground underfoot crunched and shifted as they came upon a stretch of land made up of loose stones and gravel in their own torchlight they could see that this created a kind of ramplike path up towards the island its a beach freya said laughing slightly or at least it used to be they mounted the top of the ramp on an ascent of fine powdery sand the light was stronger and grew from a point just below a small rise shh hissed daniel listen they all heard the singing now many voices in chorus melodic but indistinct it sounded strange to them after all this time of walking in the silent dark but there it was they proceeded up the rise alert ready for nearly anything but they werent prepared for the smell it was a homely smell of warm food and wood smokesome sort of stew at a guess the singing had given way to an amiable chatter the travelers rounded the mound drawing closer and freya immediately wondered if it might all be some sort of illusion meant to confuse them for as they came around the base of the mound they saw a group of people sitting around a large fire their hands moving vigorously in industrious work creeping closer freya counted eight women all of them ancient sitting in a circle around a modest campfire working on a long piece of grey patterned cloth spread across their laps at one end two old ladies worked spinning machinesturning a large pile of thin wispy material into spools of thread which were placed onto a loom that was operated by two others this loom spewed a fine fabric from its top that was gathered by another who stretched and pulled the cloth the cloth then crossed the laps of two other women who placed the woven fabric into large embroidery frames where they added borders of an elaborate swirling pattern the finished cloth then entered a large stack of long rolls that were piled behind the group because of the darkness freya couldnt make out how many rolls of cloth there were but she had the impression of quite a large number as its production had apparently been going on for some time the last old lady flitted around the others to helptoting spools to the loom fixing the frames in different places and doing whatever else needed doing she also paused occasionally to stir the large pot on the fire at the centre of the circle freya and daniel and the knights watched in silence for a few moments and then entered the circle of light cast by the fire they stood between the weaving machine and the embroiderers freya felt a tingle of anticipation as she drew breath to speak hello she said all of them continued oblivious except for the old woman at the large pot she stopped stirring and turned towards them well hello there sweet child she replied where did you spring from um weve been traveling we saw the light and came here we thought you might be able to help us whos us deary who is we my friends and i weoh the old woman tilted her face so that the light from the fire fell on it more directly her eye sockets were empty and puckered blind glancing quickly at the others she could see that all of the women were blind haltingly nervously freya introduced herself and the rest of the group to the weaving women very pleased to meet you im sure said the old lady now i must ask you an important question think carefully before you answer would you or would you not like to have some good hot stew freya grinned yes please she said i can hear your smile the old woman said i daresay you have answered correctly come then all of you come get some eats freya daniel whispered im not sure that we should he looked cautiously around at the group of ladies although they had not stopped working it was obvious that they were all paying attention to what was going on not until we find outyou knowif they can be trusted or not young boydaniel is it what is there to worry about why not trust us what reason is there for suspicion well for a start you know my name who are you and what are you doing here he asked weaving my dear weaving why there must always be weaversand gatherers and combers and spinners as well it is the way of humanity the first thing that man understood when he knew things as god knew them was that there must be weaving and so here we are we weave butwhat is it the old woman smiled showing a full mouth of healthy white teeth all the known and unknown stories of the world may be told through our tapestry we roll up the past weave the present and spin the strands of the future its all one to us but you cant see daniel blurted the old woman waved a wrinkled hand dont need to bother with that no more gets in the way more often than not all we have to do is feel and then move our hands now are you satisfied enough to chance a taste of my stew i would said ecgbryt pushing his way into the circle as would i said swigar behind him and thank you for your generosity daniel said nothing but followed the knights and freya and stood in front of the big pot smiling the old lady gathered up some clay bowls and spoons that were lying on a low stone table nearby my youre a strong thread arent you you and the girl both such a shame though what well in tough times when the fabric wears thin and weaker threads break the stronger threads have to pick up the slack daniel frowned as he was handed a bowl of steaming stew so can you predict the future freya asked because of your weaving oh no said the woman none see the future but when youve lived as long as i you get to know the pattern all the threads follow their own paths but each is affected by those around them each strand is small in itself but all are great together a very many threads seen together will give you a pattern or a shape but even that will only be small in the larger work she spooned up another bowl and passed it to freya the threads go here and there and make all manner of twists and turns but it is always to a purpose though it may not seem that way to the thread to the thread all that happens feels accidental but those as sees more knows better so the threads cant decide where they go or choose what part of pattern theyre in no of course not said the woman lightly how could they theyre only threads not people she handed the last bowls to swigar and ecgbryt none of the other weavers had stopped working during this exchange freya eyed the rolls of fabric how long have you been here she asked oh year unknown upon year innumerable came the reply have you ever tried to leave where is there to go where do you get the stuff to weave with asked daniel worms little worms we are provided for we dont ask for much even the meat for the stew comes to us freely luckily daniel and freya had already eaten a couple mouthfuls of the chunky broth and it tasted good enough to keep them from imagining what they were eating whatever it was it tasted so incredibly good that they didnt want to stop eating the warmth of the food started in their stomachs and spread to their arms and legs yes all manner of things that you wouldnt dream of managin to fetch up here the old woman continued you could hardly credit it all sorts of unimaginable persons and beasts and creatures her voice was starting to drone daniels and freyas hands felt hot and heavy and a couple of sizes too big daniel felt himself rocking backwards as freya began tilting forwards she wondered if she should stop herself falling asleep but couldnt think of a reason why it would feel so nice to lie down on the floor and rest as daniel quietly collapsed he managed to loll his head around to look at swigar and ecgbryt they were still awake but obliviously spooning stew into their mouths daniels eyes closedor at least he thought that they did he felt himself spinning downwards even though he knew he wasnt moving and he slept freya woke up with a start the first thing she was aware of was an odd rhythmic pounding sensation that went through her skull it took her a few seconds to discover that the pounding was coming from outside her head rather than from the inside then she was able to discern chanting above the pounding the ladies were reciting a worksong they punctuated its melodic style with stamps of their feet and scrapes and clacks of whatever machine or tool they were using a brownie takes milk takes milk takes milk a brownie takes milk takes milk oh a child will do for a faerie or elf a pixie or kobold or hob they will bear it away to their home in the hills and replace it with a small changeling sprite but they cannot bide iron so make you a crib out of oakwith nine strong fourinch nails and hang up a horseshoe over window and door and the imps will as like pass you by wist i that the imps will as like pass you by but a brownie takes milk will take milk only milk yes a brownie takes milk it takes milk a troll will want teeth but will settle for toenails by the bushel the yard or the pound and a giant wants bones he can grind into meal to make bread for his mother to eat though these beasts are enormous you will find them quite slow at a riddle a sonnet or verse they will tear out their hair and will scratch up their face but an answer they will give you none not one no an answer they can give you none and a brownie will only take milk ever milk yes a brownie will only take milk a dragon wants gold it can put in a pile something to stack and to count it may take a maiden a sheep or a cow to assuage it and soothe its fierce greed it will give you confusion and fire and doubt for its forked tongue spouts flame and deceit you can kill it with courage and with valor and steel but its treasure will not bring you health or wealth no its treasure will not bring you health but a brownie will only take milk from a mother from a mother the brownie takes milk there are others like ghouls and zombies and wights who desire your flesh and your skin and the merfolk the nyads the kelpie and such are jealous of all mortal souls much like bog sprites and will o the wisps who will lead you astray unto death they do not have reason or morals just wit so ignore them and let them pass by oh aye just ignore them and theyll pass you by but a brownie will only take milk from a mother that she uses to suckle her child for a brownie is patient and a brownie is sly and no matter how the baby does wriggle or cry the brownie will hide and will watch and drink milk and will wait for the poor bairn to die so place you some buttermilk fresh from the churn in a dish by the back kitchen door do this every morning and once sunday evening and the brownie will not grieve you more no more leave some milk from the churn on the floor for a brownie takes milk will take milk does take milk yes a brownie takes milk it takes milk the weaving ladies stopped singing at this last haunting verse but continued moving their tools and stomping in time what was that freya asked weakly sitting up she had been placed on a pile of animal skins and furs her head was swimming slightly and her stomach felt queasy youre up deary said the woman at the pot on second glance she seemed different from the one who had given them the stew but it was hard to tell you have quick blood said the lady as she hobbled blindly towards her here chew this from the folds in her clothes she produced a kind of twisty sticklike thing about the size of a toothbrush what is it birch bark steeped in ginger it will still your head and stomach go on take it take it you are safe here the rest did you good just as it is doing good to your friends there freya moved her head and saw daniel and the two knights stretched out beside her also on skins and furs they looked peaceful enough daniel was curled up on his side and ecgbryt was snoring she turned back to the old lady and felt a wave of nausea at the movement she reached out and took the stick of bark from the woman and stuck it between her teeth let me help you up said the lady try to move around take this the woman draped a soft silky shawl over freyas shoulders and got her to stand she directed her towards the fire quick blood repeated the woman first down but first up fast thoughts and quick judgments the waters may appear still on top but there are faster currents underneath eh are you talking about me perhaps not so fast then allow me to say to you that it does our hearts good to see one of our sisters on a business such as thisdoes us all good wars are unavoidablesome of them are inevitablebut the real business of life is a womans business freya was still very groggy and her head felt muzzy she wasnt taking in much of what the old woman was saying but men always forget that the dear sweet idiots love to fight bless them but they too often forget what theyre fighting for need one of us to remind them of it on occasion one that will make them heed one to make those who lead go someplace and one to make those who wont be led to follow are you talking about me freya asked again starting to feel better the odd stick was doing its work and settling her system ah a little swifter now eh lets walk take my arm they moved away from the camp freya guiding the older woman and supporting her by the arm so you think i can do this quest sort of thing freya asked when they had crested a ridge and the light from the camp was a pale glow behind them my sweet you were made for it made for it so do i have a choice its who you are my dear you can reject it but you cant change it the old lady was silent for a time which allowed freya to think about this in your way the woman eventually continued you are rarer than any of the others there will always be fighterslots of fighters but not many will be able to do what you will be asked to do the decisions you will face will affect many many people huh you know freya began thoughtfully back on the surface where i live it feels like a lot of people think women arent as good as menlike we arent equal of course we arent equal my dear one were much better than they are freya laughed that was not really in earnest and also not true equal doesnt really enter into itwe will never be equal because there are too many differences but were the real doersthe real makers men work the fields hunt the animals and we make the food and cook the meat they raise the flocks and we make the clothes they provide the house and we make a homethe children the family all the fruits of mans labor on earth must pass through our hands freya twirled the stick between her lips all the wars the woman went on all the kickin and thumpin thats been done has all been on our account as to make a space for us to do our work all the kingdoms and walls as has been made has been made to protect uswhats worth protectin there was a pause and when the old woman spoke again her voice was lower and colder an evil has been building on these shores for some hundreds of years its been growing all around and creeping in at the edges slowly like so that none would notice at onceand when they did notice they would be used to it like theres many a true heart up there that should be burning hot and bright but because of the darkness and decay it is dim and hardly gives a light at all us blind weavers may not be able to see with our eyes but we know how dark the tapestry were weaving has become a whole island fallen asleep not knowin its bein sucked into the mire the world has always carried sickness inside of it but it is falling into a swoon freya removed the stick from her mouth you really think that we can do thiswhatever needs to be done youre the right threadthe right length and the right luster and youre in the right place it remains to be proved whether you are strong enough to hold yet just remember that inside you bear the strength of hundreds of thousands of your sisters before you it will guide you but you must listen to it and nothing else she left freya and the girl remained staring into the darkness after a while she sat down and wrapped her arms around her knees and didnt rise again until she heard the voices of the men behind her they set out from the weaver womens camp feeling more rested than at any time since leaving niergeard they had been given some short strips of dried meat that were as tough as leather but also rather flavorful the travelers left the dry island by the same beach that they had arrived the ground from there onwards continued sloping downwards and they found it getting damper then they started coming across large puddlesstill black pools of water swigar cautioned them to watch their step as there was no telling how deep these pools might be the surfaces they could see could be just thin films of water on rock or they could be the skin of a fathomless sinkhole the currents of which could take them away faster than it was possible to fight even stepping very near the edges of the puddles was a risk swigar said as a rocky bank could crumble away for this reason the travelers spread out and tied the rope to their belts to connect themselves to each other for safety swigar took the first position with ecgbryt following directly behind him freya and daniel were led along an unpredictable and erratic path as the puddles grew wider more frequent and irregularly shaped they found themselves at a dead end and were forced to turn back and find a different path the air was growing colder chilled by the dampness that freya now associated with darkness so deep that it felt massive because of the meandering path they were forced to take their journey over the lake bed plain although tedious and uneventful was far from boring they found the tension and uncertainty exhausting they took more breaks than they felt were probably necessary daniel and freya would fall to the ground their heads nearly spinning from all the turns and uturns they had to make out of dead ends and culdesacs in the light of their lamps they saw a structure ahead of them and they made their way to it it was another pier a longer and bigger one but just as dry and ruined as the last they scaled the bank and found that the pier was an extension of a large ramp that went steeply upwards they had no choice but to go up they walked many hours and took many breaks never knowing how high this underground mountainwhich is what they came to think of it asrose ahead of them the last time freya could remember climbing so high was while hiking in the lake district but climbing so high and still being underground was a very different sensation she was glad that she couldnt see how far up they were it felt as if they were leaving the wild caves far behindwhich she was glad ofbut how much farther did they have to climb there was an indefinable change in the air and the noise that their footsteps made allowed them to sense a narrowing of the walls around them the ground became steeper and then curled around them shunting them to the left creating a wall to their right cresting the mound of scree they found themselves on a rock shelf that ran to their left and no option but to follow it they moved cautiously each of them inwardly terrified that the ground would give way beneath them but to their relief it broadened and continued on then they discovered the carvings all of a sudden the wall was covered with them most of them looked like writing but with odd letters that were made of straight lines only no curves some of them were long horizontal lines with perpendicular and slanting lines stemming from and intersecting the baseline daniel ran his hands along them they were set very deeply into the rock sometimes there was just a single running line a couple of inches high and a foot long scrawled here and there like graffiti at other points there were large blocks of tightly packed letters with no spaces several feet in length and height well blocked out and bordered one set of carvings quite startled daniel he had to stop and pull back his torch to see the full extent of them lines of words snaked through each other like ribbons randomly twisting and splitting and converging caught in the middle of this was a man with a bearded face kneeling with his arms raised the words twisting around him and his limbs his face almost cartoonlike in its simplicity nonetheless wore the look of someone in deep anxiety the others seeing daniel had stopped returned to stand beside him they spent a few silent moments contemplating the picture freya shuddered swigar ecgbryt said in a low voice you are more familiar with the old script than i can you read it hmm not easily swigar answered i wish ceolfer were here he was more the scholar than i the letters i know but not their arrangement it is not our tongue he stepped forward and reached a hand out to some crudely etched words only a sentence long apart from these he said which forbid the passing of any person it is a curse written backwards perhaps all these words are written backwards he said casting his eyes across the wall daniel felt a chill ripple across his shoulders the words and banks of letters were no longer an interesting puzzle but a wall of angry and oppressive words aware of them warning them away cursing them i fear no curse from man or devil declared swigar my heart has been sealed against both by one stronger than any enchanted a short distance farther they came across a cave mouthan archway in the rock it was obviously manmade and bordered with row upon row of angrylooking writing that none of them even wanted to read there were columns or standing stones that had been placed in front of the tunnel entrance like two rows of guards three on each side each stone covered top to bottom in angrylooking letters thankfully the writing did not continue inside the tunnelthe walls were unmarked in any way as the travelers stood wondering what might be in that tunnel and where it led they heard a slow rhythmic scraping sound start up that grated on their spines they stood silently listening to it and holding their lanterns up in front of them after a minute it stopped and with deep breaths they entered the tunnel its walls were not rounded but octagonal whoever had constructed the passage must have been meticulous in its carving for though it twisted and turned maddeningly the walls and diagonals kept their shape never moving farther away or closer together the meandering passage bends became corners then hairpins tightly packed together turning first this way and then that and then the other the travelers picked their way along and were starting to feel quite dizzy and disoriented with all the zigzagging right and then right again full left right left right right leftwhen suddenly the floor fell from underneath them chapter thirteen reunion now she was at her desk again it was more cluttered than before there were large open binders before her packed tight with grids of letters and numbers she was transliterating from greek into arabic numerals she remembered and had been writing a guide for herself in english there was a sheet of paper in front of her that was filled with her handwriting she started reading it jesnubim once separate from her passions from joy became pregnant with the contemplation of the lights that accompanied him ie the angels with him andthey teachcraving them she produced fruits after their image a spiritual offspring generated after the likeness of the saviors bodyguards now of these three essences thatthey saywere extant one derived from her passion and this was the matter another derived from her turning back and this was the animate another was what she brought forth and this was the spiritual and so on there were more sheets beneath it all still in her handwriting and all seemingly gibberish theres no reason she would have written all that she heard a small cry that sent a shock through herit was an infants cryher childs she stood up and rushed to the next room where the cot was stooping over the cot she gazed at the tiny red face that howled up at her abruptly she straightened alarmed this wasnt her child but if not hers whose and where was hers no that was ridiculous she didnt have a child she was too young but it was hers and it was still screaming freya reached into the cot and pulled it out shouldering the infant she started bouncing it up and down to calm it but she held it awkwardly unnaturally was it a boy or a girl its name was daniel she was sure of that much oh no daniel she exclaimed her body tensing she nearly lost her grip on the child as her mind flashed to a terrible image someone she once knew running towards her falling and then disappearing into thin air danieli have to help daniel the infant at her shoulder began wailing again she put it back in the cot and then went back to her desk how could she have forgotten something as important as this there was a large black marker in a pencil cup and she uncapped it and wrote on the first sheet of paper that she could findthe page with her meaningless drivel on itin large block letters must save daniel then she stood back and looked at the words who was daniel the baby was crying why was it so hard to remember things all of a sudden her head was so foggy these days the sky grew darker she was tiredstill tired how long had she been asleep a headache was growing at the base of her skull she was hungry when was the last time she had eaten something the fog was growing but she had to push through everything felt dissociated all that she was truly aware of were the words on the page and the growing dread that she couldnt remember more freya darling she heard a voice call from the doorway she sprang around to see felix in the doorway one hand went to her papers and gathered them together darling sophia was crying he held the infant who was quiet though still redfaced and teary what have you been doing she didnt know how to reply i was just writing felix looked into her eyes are you feeling okay did you take your pills freya opened a drawer and pulled out a small plastic bottle these arent my pills i dont take these what are you writing dearest freya brushed her papers closer together dont touch me please sweetheart please take your pills you always feel much better after them ill start dinner why dont you review what youve written felix left the room with the babysophia not danieland she sat a moment in thought she stared down at the pages in front of her none of it made any sensethese werent words in front of her what was happening to her and why was she so sleepy daniel pointed out the familiar shape on the coloured banner kyle thats great britain he said then i have taken you to the right place this is our destination they made their way through the crowds and into a tent that was covered apparently not wanting to display its goods they pushed through a series of veils and curtains that hung under an awning into a room that was dark lit by oil lamps there were plush carpets underfoot and a dozen cabinets displaying mostly ornamental objects in the centre of this tableaux sat the proprietor adrift in the middle of a pool of cushions rotund and upholstered rather like a cushion himself welcome he greeted them brightly thrusting squat little arms at them he had a fat jolly face with extravagantly curled whiskers that supported a large bulbous purple hat on his head that looked something like a turban i am reizger lokkich what can i offer you fine gentlemen this afternoon i have all manner of objects from distant lands and ages gone by from coins and keepsakes to sculptures and machines whose use and operation are unknown even to me how do i fix a price on such items you may ask i have no way of knowing a potential bargain lurks on every table he laughed heartily at this amused it seemed by his own ignorance and generosity the collier gave the tables only the most cursory of glances we are here for another purpose than trinket gathering he said this oneindicating danielis from another land the land of england daniel supplied the land of england and he needs to return you were once known as a traveler upon a time know you of any way to return him to where he needs to be while kyle was speaking the merchants bushy eyebrows were traveling up his forehead and his mouth was contracting more and more until it was just a small circle below a long moustache when the collier paused his features snapped back into place he stood up and approached daniel his salesmans mannerisms evaporated and he ran his eyes up and down in a professional manner touching him on the arm and turning his palms outwards in order to study them it has been a long time since those paths were used by our people they may be difficult to travel now the merchant tilted daniels head and peered into his ears daniel felt like he was being appraised and that a price would be offered for him shortly yes he looks in fair condition to travel allow me to consult my chart book he rose and adjusted one of the lamps so that it gave off a brighter gleam pulling a large square book from a chest behind the bank of cushions he settled himself and started thumbing the pages which seemed to be filled with dozens of interlocking circles of varying size annotated with small scribbles within these circles were landmarks like mountains cairns trees caves standing stones churches and so on bordering these were pictures of the sun and moon in different phases the merchant settled on one page and ran his fingers along it reading the scrawls under his breath a young elf dressed in suede leathers pushed his way through the gauze veils of the tent excuse me kyle but youre needed back at your stall i will be done here shortly the collier replied but it is agrid fiallhe demands your presence he refuses to have dealings with your wife kyle growled annoyed very well he sighed i leave him in your hands reizger lokkich the merchants eye flicked up see that you do right by him he is not to pay you since he is currently my property all payment will come from me after he has returned home see that he does nothing to jeopardise his return daniel can you remember the way back to the tent he replied that he could make sure you take nothing away with you and that nothing is placed on your person and with that final warning he left with the messenger the merchant lokkich returned to his book and traced a path along the page with a fingertip then he looked up at daniel beaming youre in luck he exclaimed tapping the page we are just at the start of a cycle and in the ideal place to cross overup at the meeting rock we could try tomorrow night in fact it will be a weak pull but one in the right direction if that doesnt work the one five days later almost certainly will tell me how urgently do you want to get back fairly urgentlyi think my friend is in danger ah then its important that you leave as soon as possible there are things that i can do to help you but lokkich looked sad what is it asked daniel sensing a hustle im afraid that the cost would be far beyond the means of a poor woodburner you obviously have something in mind lets hear what it is without the whole drama the merchant smiled ah you see through me i see i have misjudged your cleverness forgive me i meant no insult it is just that sometimes a softer touch is needed with clients no matter we will talk as equals and lay everything on the table before us yes there are things i can do to help but they are expensive in short it means loading you up with some of my wares which i have appropriated from your own world these will act as forces to draw you closer your destinationall things wish to return to their place of origin however you cannot buy them as you have no money nor can i just give them to you as that would make you beholden to me and increase your ties here no you will need to earn them how by doing a job for meworking for me in short like you work for the collier i do not wish to trap or ensnare youremember its in my interest to see you safely home but the type of work will be determined by the value of the objects you need alright lets see these objects then daniel said not too happy to be dealing like this but if it meant he could get home faster it would be worth it of course please take a seat he said rising and arranging a few cushions opposite his own pile daniel settled on these as the merchant waddled over to a display cabinet think of yourself as a magnetand the more things you possess from your own world the greater your pull back to that world will be he fiddled around behind the cabinet and took out a drawer carrying it carefullyalmost reverentlyand laying it on the floor between them the objects that are most recent will have the strongest pull and will be more worth carrying the oldest ones will be almost useless to you daniel laughed when he saw what the drawer from the cabinet containedit was just full of junk there was a bundle of pencils of varying lengths and sharpnesssome even bore teeth marks all tied up in a silk ribbon there was a gardening fork lying inside a glass case a jar containing coins bottle caps ring pulls paper clips and brass tacks there was a pair of binoculars something that looked like an oven knob a bottle of ink and more besides it is up to you to choose the most recent or valuable to you tell me do you recognise any of these items the merchant asked i recognise all of them how did you find them i have my sources the merchant said guardedly tell me this manuscript what is its nature the merchant reverently handed him a bundle of decaying papers this is a comic book i have studied it closely but do not understand the writing is it a history of one of your heroes its a storynone of this really happened he handed it back its not so old it was printed about twenty years ago what about this thats more recentits a video cassette tape what is it used for amusement you stick it in a machine and it plays a story for you we have lots of them where i come from this one is doctor who the merchant looked at him blankly its a science fiction tv show that would probably help me out if i had it as would this i suppose he picked up liner notes from a cd and flicked through it and that definitely he pointed to a cell phone charger so these three items the vidosette tape the small booklet the wire with the weight on it and the manuscript as well daniel shrugged sure the comic book as well why not what about these can you tell what they are he handed daniel a rectangular red box made out of thin cardboard it had special grain full metal jacket printed on its side these are bullets he said turning the box around in his hands so that they were the right way up he opened the boxit was full they can be quite dangerous would you take those id rather not so the merchant said businesslike again four items from your world and valuable ones at that and if i have these i can go back tomorrow night very likely can you guarantee it not absolutely but with my experience as a traveler between worlds i can offer you near certainty as certain as anyone can be in these matters okay what do i have to do that moneylender the merchant said nodding at the tent flap agrid fiall is a vile and detestable creature who has the throat of this nation in his grasp he is a disgusting leech who holds entire cities to debt and squeezes them as dry as if they were in a vice families starve because of him and yet he blithely carries on squeezing and squeezing every debtor as dry as a bone due to his power he has risen to a high position in court and as a shameless flatterer to the princely brothers he is here in attendance with prince lhiamlhiat at this fayre ive heard of him already what do you want me to do daniel asked already having an inkling kill him daniel considered would that be hard i have already devised a plan that will put you at minimum riskone blow and an easy escape i must protect my investment after all daniel thought a little longer and then said very well ill do it but ill need those bullets after all and also he said pointing to a black metallic object in the centre of the tray ill need that to put them in are you sure you are up to this lokkich asked can i really count on you to complete this task its not the first time ive assassinated an evildoer she lay in bed tired weak and confused her body felt wrong it was almost too much of an effort to move so many things felt wrong it was hard to think there was something important she had to do she had to rescue someone who herself professor stowefelixwas sleeping next to her she could see his back and armpale flabby and it disgusted her repulsed but still with a tremendous effort of will she pushed herself up and swung her feet out of beddizzy and she wasnt even standing up yet she pulled the covers off and hoisted herself to her feet gripping the side of the bed to steady herself she made her way to the door catching sight of her reflection in a fulllength mirror she halted she looked old much older than she used to look her face was gaunt and eyes sunken her lips were thinnereven her hair looked tired it no longer displayed the black sheen that she was secretly proud of she shut her eyes this wasnt her she was someone else a soft squeal from the corner of the room made her jump the baby she needed to escape should she take that with her it didnt seem right to leave the child and anyway the crying might wake the professor gathering strength from she didnt know where she crossed the room and took the baby from a small white cot holding it against herself she rocked it gently and staggered out of the room she was in the hallway the air was cold and through the window she could see it was snowing should she make her escape now in this weather she was so hungry instead of going out of the flat front door she went into the kitchen the place was spotlessly clean still shouldering the child she opened the refrigerator and recoiled it was stocked with food but everything was rotten or overgrown with mold a head of lettuce had partially turned to sludge milk had separated in its plastic container that showed only a whitishblue fuzz through its transparent lid she swung the door closed there must be something in the cupboards she opened the one nearest to herempty the next was full of drinking glasses finally in the third cupboard she found some tinned food she grabbed some baked beans down and put them on the counter she put the baby on the centre of the kitchen table amused bewildered it gazed beatifically up at the ceiling she pulled open a drawer and grabbed a can opener working frantically she managed to get the lid off of the tin it was empty or at least not completely empty for there were dried streaks of bean juice clinging to the sides of the tin as if it had once contained beans but a long time ago she reached for a can of pineapple slices and opened that it was empty as well except for the sickly sweet smell of old fruit this was too weird she picked up the baby turned to leave and immediately halted there was a small girl in the doorway mum is breakfast ready ssophia she stammered mum im hungry the girlshe must be about seven years oldsaid primly no time come on were leaving where grabbing sophias hand she dragged the girl down the hallway and out of the door of the flat mummy the little girl said as they started down the stairs i dont want to go outside its cold and snowy itll be fine freya said not at all convinced of this herself she felt the girls hand pull away from hers as they reached the bottom of the steps i have to put my wellies on freya tried the door handle but it was locked she pulled it harder and frantically looked around for the key where is it where is it she muttered under her breath its on the windowsill sophia said pointing snatching up the key she thrust it into the lock it turned and in another moment she had the door open there was at least a foot of snow on the ground and she was barefoot but she couldnt stay any longer she pulled the key out of the keyhole the baby started crying come on freya called over her shoulder i need my coat no time she snapped freya darling came a voice from above her what are you doing come on she whispered holding out her hand to sophia i dont want to go the baby howled freya where are you going come up and have some breakfast there was a rush of wind that slammed the door shut frantically she flung it open again then with her foot outstretched to prevent the door from closing she reached in and grabbed sophias arm she heaved herself through the doorway and into the snowfilled front yard only there wasnt any snow and suddenly there wasnt a sophia anymore she stumbled and fell she found herself lying on grass in the whole garden there wasnt a flake of snow to be seen freya looked down at herself and let out a long strange cry of surprise and reliefshe was dressed in the same pink blouse and jeans that she had been wearing when she first visited the old observatory her head was clear now it hadnt been years after all it had been what days she started laughingit was all a dream or an illusion there were no childrenshe was now just clutching a dirty tea towel against her shoulder there was no important work she was doing translating that strange gobbledegook all of it since she met that weird little groupthe militant gerrard cross the odd leigh sinton the rotund brent wood she paused she had an aunt who used to live in a town called brent wood and the reverend peter borough peterborough and felix felixstowethat was a harbor town on the west coast shed caught a ferry there once those were names of towns not people but why were they illusions too and her tutor what did it mean daniel it had something to do with daniels disappearance freya heard her name being called from inside stowes legs could be seen at the top of the stairs scrambling to her feet she flew to the door and pulled it closed she still had the key which she used to lock it stowes shape appeared dark in the frosted glass and he gave it a bang with his fist then swift as a thought he turned and dashed back up the stairs freya needed no further prompting she spun around and as fast as her weak and malnourished body could move she pushed open the front gate and ran out into the street feeling uncomfortable in the fine elfin clothes that the merchant lokkich gave him daniel nonetheless tried to look natural his sword was at his side and a leather pouch which seemed heavier than the weight it contained bounced against his thigh he had become lost in his thoughts and had fallen behind awin kaayn the musician he had met on the road that was a stroke of luck the merchants plan had been a good one but daniel was able to refine it to enter the feast hall as the minstrels assistant was his idea and would remove much risk and attention from the operation by chanceor providence or fate for everything so far had gone unbelievably smoothlydaniel had actually been introduced to agrid fiall returning to kyle and pettyls stall he had encountered a small crowd of people clustered around it he slipped in around them and edged to the back of the booth kyle was standing in the middle of the room his powerful body at ease and all the more threatening for his casual strengthhe was taller than anyone else there before him was an elf who was dressed in an outfit that was splendid even by elfish standards thin black robes enfolded him trimmed with grey and white lacethe one serving as an accent for the other pearls of varying sizes and brilliance were set into the black cloth creating swirling patterns as if depicting the sky on a hailstorm night his face wore a thick bushy beard that was jetblack and streaked with bright white hairs which seemed to be a piece of the costume as well on either side of him stood what were obviously elfin soldiers they wore silver helmets and chest plates that were etched with woodland scenes everything else was covered with thick embossed leather short swords hung at their sides and long thin spears rose over their heads behind these three were nobles and what appeared to be merchants of a higher class than those who owned stalls the eyes of all of these men turned towards daniel as he entered immediately pegging him as someone who didnt belong who is this youngman the black figure asked he is an unfortunate boy who fell into our world and came into my care i have already made arrangements for him to return to his own world it has been some time since i have seen a human you used to see more of them aboutwhen we used to steal them are you sure it is not a changeling its so hard to tell with those animals my name is agrid fiall young human what is yours daniel tully your lordship fiall laughed daniel tully your lordship he repeated in a mocking tone id forgotten how they sound when they speak marvelous simply marvelous one might almost believe that they were able to think as we do there was that bard who managed it once but i never saw him and believe reports of him to be exaggerated will you sell him to me no kyle said once with finality anyhow where were we with the negotiations fiall continued the price is the price kyle said firmly there is no changing it come now it is your patriotic duty to supply us with charcoal for the fires needed to draw silver and gold from rock its what keeps many families fed and clothed if ever i saw a grain of this gold or silver then my consideration may be different as i dont share in the fortunes of those who use what i make i must set the price that seems fair to me do you want to own a part of a smelters works there is one im looking for a partner in the moneylender asked with a raised eyebrow daniel had seen this expression many times before and had no doubt that even though the offer was in earnest hed find some way to cheat and ruin whoever took him up on it kyle simply continued to gaze stoically at the minister no matter then agrid fiall replied he took a deep breath as if regretting what he was about to say and wanting to put it off as long as possible i was trying to spare you some amount of shame you see the royal budget only extends to two barrels of your stock that is no shame of mine it means that we will have to requisition another nine kyles face was impassive that is far less than fair he said eventually there is no need to tell me that fiall said in a plaintive tone it is how things are and i feel as badly put upon as you do no doubt that is all i can offer unless unless you want to sell me the human go on please kyle did not respond so the moneylender gave instruction over his shoulder pay him are you taking the charcoal now daniel asked fiall fiall had been about to turn away but paused for a final quizzical look at daniel then with a humorous chuckle agrid fiall left completely ignoring the question however an elf apparently a clerk of some sort stepped forward with a bag of money and while counting out silver coins said to kyle delivery will be taken tomorrow morning we want these five and those five over there no others i shall mark them for you that was the whole of the interaction with the man that daniel was supposed to kill and he reflected on it as he stayed close to awin kaayn drawing his new skyblue cloak tighter around his shouldersanother piece of equipment from reizger lokkich and struggling to keep kaayns enormous guitar on his back he had offered to carry it to make it look like he had a purpose there but now he wished he hadnt it was more strain in a stressful situation still he supposed it helped to hide his nervousness he was now suspecting that elves were far more perceptive and observant than most humans werethey seemed able to actually see emotions not just what was on your face but perhaps what was in your heart as well and fastabove all else in daniels experience elves were fast things hadnt gone so well with kyle and pettyl he told them that hed made another deal with lokkich which he wasnt able to tell them about but it meant that they wouldnt have to pay anything and that hed most likely be leaving tonight pettyl had started to ask questions which daniel wasnt about to answer kyle who must have had some idea said to him daniel dont do this new deal stay with us for the next few days and take the surer more natural route home no i have to get back soon ive heard my friends voice calling metwice now i just feeli need to get back as soon as possible i know it she needs me it may not be in the plan that you reach her so soon plan what plan the plan of the universe the natural order that instructs all things that guides the hearts of all living things i shouldnt even be here though daniel said resentfully if the universe had a plan to protect every living thing then id have stayed where i belonged in order to protect freya we arent to know the plan pettyl broke in it is not for you to judge where you most belong what does it matter what i do anyway if its such a great plan dont think of it as a planthink of it as all of the created worlds working in an ideal state nothing is set but things have a best course within this we may stay on our course or travel a different one if we go this other way then we have made things disordered and it may be difficult to correct after that more it may knock others out of alignment but as far as i can tell daniel argued that sort of thing is happening all the timeat least it is where i come from and hearing here about the death of the true king and the exiling of the elves who followed him as well as agrid fiall taking advantage of you and everyone else like he doesit seems to me like the universe needs a little helping hand to correct things and if i can then why shouldnt i is it the ideal state that good people suffer daniel felt his blood warm and skin tingle things were falling into place now it was getting clearer i was brought to this point by the universeby god this has happened to me before here i am further away from my ideal state than ive ever been ive been put in an almost impossible situation once again and i know that i have the ability to win through and set things right if there is a universal plan then theres no way im not a part of it im probably the only one in this world who can fix things and the universe knows itthats why it brought me here first ill fix this problem and then ill go back and fix my own sometimes a correction can swing out of control and cause as many problems as the problem it was meant to fix ill bear that in mind seeing as im the only one fixing things im the only one who has to worry about that kyle left at that point walking out of the tent with a sad face pettyl seemed as if she wanted to say more but didnt instead she asked if daniel was leaving now and he said he probably would she gave him some food and he thanked her for everythingfor looking after him helping with his elfish feeding him and more besides he didnt want the last thing between them to be an argument then he left and said goodbye to kyle who was standing at the entrance to the tent he didnt say anything at first he just shook daniels hand even after all this time daniel still found him hard to read the collier didnt seem angry though he smiled as he gave daniel a parting gifta large golden leaf this is a leaf he explained from the oldest tree that i know of in the forest it has stood in the centre of the forest since before anyone started to count the years it is very old and yet every spring it produces new leaves this is something of this place that you can take with you it shouldnt weigh you down much at all and it will point you in the right direction if ever you return daniel had thanked him and put the leaf in an old schoolbook that he still carried around in his backpack the feast hall was an enormous building with wide semicircular arches bowing overhead from the rafters hung more of the brightly coloured banners and pendants with entrancing designs there were two rows of benches running nearly the full length of the hall which stopped before a long table that was raised on a platform overlooking the enormous room this was the high table where the elf prince his consort and the most important members of his court were to sit it is where agrid fiall would sit daniel surreptitiously made his way to the back of the hall behind the high table and pushed past one of the tapestries there were two large wooden doors that were standing wide open directly in front of them was the kitchen tent where cooks and servers were busily preparing the feast the smell was unlike anything hed ever smelt beforeit was the rich sweet smell of caramelizing glazes on top of roasting meat of spiced breads and pastries of freshly tapped casks of ale and wine and a dozen more familiar and unfamiliar they all mingled into a single overpowering aroma that made daniels mouth water and sent a sharp pain to his stomach which had only had fruit and nuts for the last to him weeks and now demanded something weightier with a regretful swallow daniel pressed on he had to step to one side as a bevy of elfin servers pushed past him carrying wide platters of fresh fruit smothered in a dark syrupy sauce sighing inwardly daniel turned to the right and entered a narrow corridor made up of the wooden wall of the feast hall and the canvas tent of the kitchens this led to the flimsy wooden shack that served as a toilet for the revelers it was nothing more than two long troughlike pits with a short narrow but sturdy benchlike railing before them at full capacity it could probably accommodate five on each sideten altogether daniel walked the length of this building where a disgusting stink that completely eradicated the pleasant odors of just a few moments ago hung like a mist and pushed against the far wall which as lokkich had assured him came apart at one end just enough for him to squeeze through he did this and found himself between the wooden wall of the latrine and the cloth of the tent around it it was dark damp and smelled completely foul crouching he tried as hard as he could to separate his mind from his circumstances and waited it was torture the longer he stayed the hotter and stuffier the tiny sliver of space became he heard the feast start as if from a great distance the faint notes of a trumpet announcing the arrival of the prince and other nobles reached him trickling like birdsong there was a pause a cheer and then music lovely and haunting but which came to him in scraps and pieces his mind tried to fill in images to match what he was hearing but daniel knew it was inadequate to whatever spectacles were being performed by the elfin feasters daniel pulled the gun from the leather pouch and held it before him checking its mechanism every once in a while it was at least an hour before anyone came into the privy to relieve themselves daniel had arranged himself to lie near a convenient crack which allowed him to see the whole stretch of the room by moving his head with a very minute motion his hands had become sweaty holding the gun so he placed it before him constantly rejecting the almost constant impulse to check and reload it he had no idea how old it was though it seemed in good shape either it would work or it wouldnt it had grown dark outside and a chill was creeping in daniel pulled his cloak even tighter around himself it was quite dark and daniel wasnt sure if he would recognise agrid fiall when he appeared he didnt know what would happen if he didnt at least try to fulfill his mission a shadow appeared in the doorway and uttered a disgusted oath it raised its voice and demanded that a light be brought a servant appeared with a lit lantern illuminating the face of the selfimportant moneylender and treasurer daniel felt his pulse quicken as he lifted the gunwas it heavier than it used to be it was certainly warmerand rose silently he shifted along the wall with stiff and aching limbs so that he was near the crack in the walls that he had entered by he wrapped the fingers of his left hand around the wooden edge and gently pulled it wider he stuck his right arm through and brought it up until he had dead aim on his target over a distance of about a meter practically point blank daniel waited until fiall had finished and turned his back presenting a wider target daniel took a deep breath paused for a heartbeats time to make sure of his aim and squeezed the trigger the gun exploded and kicked in his hand fiall twitched slightly and stood stunned daniel pulled the trigger three more times and the form slumped to the ground he didnt know what it took to kill an elf but he was pretty sure that the steel in the bullets would be toxic if the wounds didnt kill him outright daniel drew his sword and stuck it in the fabric of the tent he jerked it down to rip a hole from head to knee and started to climb through it there was a shout from behind him and he saw another figure in the doorway slightly hunched over the body of agrid fiall daniel raised his gun once more sent the remaining bullets towards the silhouette and escaped into the night freya used the smaller side roads to move her way farther up into north oxford it was a winding snaking path but one that she thought would be hard to follow she was banking on the hope that felix hadnt been able to get out of the house fast enough to see which direction shed gone and so tired and exhausted she staggered past houses and parked carsas well as people who duly ignored hertowards the place she had last seen daniel at st michael and all angels church but she couldnt go there yet she limped into summertownlittle more than a busy hotspot of shops and restaurants along banbury road and a complex maze of terraced housing she found herself wearing her jacket when she left stowes apartment and in her pockets she found her cell phone and small purse that she kept her money and bank cards inthey must have been on her all along she couldnt turn on her phone its battery was probably dead she thought to go to her apartment but was afraid that stowe would find her thereor worse on the way there she knew that she should go to the police but she didnt know what would become of daniel then she had to at least make an attempt to rescue him then she would go to the authorities if it really had been days that shed been trapped then thered be another panic she may have already made the media againmissing for the second time would certainly have a headline appeal her clothes were dirty and smelly and her hair was an absolute disaster she hoped that she didnt look so alarming that she would get thrown out of anyplace she dug around in her purse for a tenpound note and held it clearly visible before her as she walked into a small cafe she put the money on the counter in front of her and ordered a baguette some fruit a packet of crisps a coffee and a bottle of juice she took this food to a small table from which she could see the street without being seen she devoured her food as calmly and as slowly as possible under the circumstances and waited she got up to use the toilet a couple times cleaning herself up as much as she was able to in the small sink and mirror always returning to her table and keeping an eye on the street and the sky she spent enough money to stop the staff from moving her on gradually nourishing herself she may not have eaten anything in days it was vitally important that she didnt collapse she needed to keep it together just a little longer at six oclock a cautious waitress came over and told her the cafe was closing freya left and wandered the back ways and parking lots of summertown until the sun was just about to set then with her heart rising in her chest she went to the church she stood outside the lychgate this is where daniel had disappearedshe could still see him taking that first step into oblivion she stared at the wooden frame and doorway and wondered what she had to do next she wanted to bring daniel back not follow after himbut could she do that and how there was a new feeling growing in her chest it wasnt anticipation or nervousnessit was more like a charge that she was getting from the air something was happening there was some sort of a presence was the only way to describe it was it danger she looked up and down the street she was completely alone but turning back to the lychgate she noticed something oddit was darker inside of it than outside she tilted her head so that the sky was visible through it and saw that not only was it darker but whereas her sky was cloudy and overcast she could see stars through the lychgate daniel she called into the archway there was no answer the darkness seemed to thicken she tried again daniel it now looked like full night through the lychgate she could see the churchyard through it but it was like looking through a veil she saw a lightat first she thought it was a trick of her eyes but the flickering glow bobbed and grew in front of her daniel racing behind reizger lokkich daniel struggled to keep up just behind the merchants swinging lantern how could such a short rotund figure move so quickly it was a concept that scared himhowever fast it was a full rank of elfish guards would undoubtedly be able to move quicker especially if they were on horseback behind him he could hear shouts and calls of alarm would they be able to track him in the dark he should probably assume so lokkich climbed a hill that stood outside the edge of the fayre he rose effortlessly up its side like a windblown beach ball while daniel staggered and gasped beside him ho there whisht lokkich called in a harsh whisper closing the shutter on his lamp a light appeared from behind a clump of treesa torch that was held by a thin gauntfaced being that looked less than human or elfish it didnt seem to have any striking features apart from its plainness it was bald with a rounded formless brow and long sagging jowls it reminded daniel more of the face of a dog there you are you wretched thing give me that lokkich said snatching the torch from its grasp daniel he said give him the cloak daniel undid the clasp of the cloak that lokkich had given him earlier and handed it over when he looked up into its face again he was so startled he let out a cry quickly raising his own hand to muffle it shh lokkich commanded handing daniel his own cloak and backpack back whats the matter do you want to make it so easy for them to find us im sorry i just daniel kept looking at the person in front of him its skin was no longer sagging it was tightening twitch by twitch into features it was making itself look like daniel a tuft of brown hair was even appearing on its head and it seemed to be shrinking thats enough you lokkich said angrily striking the thing on its head you dont want to give the game away completely take this again he thrust the torch back to the thing go that way he pointed along the tree line run your life depends on it now it took off at a run the blue cape and orange torch flames flapping behind it what is it daniel asked its a changeling vile member of a reprobate race it has its purposes though what happens if they catch it just at that moment there was a shout from below a light they heard someone call if they kill it theyll do us a favor quickly this way lokkich hurried off again with daniel trying to keep pace behind him deciding along the way that it would be a good idea to reload his handgun after a while lokkich opened the shutter on his lantern again and slowed his pace are we going to get there in time is it too late daniel asked struggling for breath were here already the other answered now take these a small bag was thrust into daniels hands it contained the items from his own world that he had killed fiall forthe videotape phone charger comic book and some odds and ends like the newer coins and mechanical pencils that daniel had picked out daniel made sure to check that they were all there watch your step lokkich cautioned daniel looked up and saw that they were standing on the top of a cliff there was a large standing stone about ten feet high and then empty airdarkness the squat merchant put his hand out and moved it around as if feeling the air he muttered some words and the space in front of them started to brighten it was as if shadows of light were growing just above the cliff face daniel he heard freyas voice call again uncertain this time this is it just step through lokkich said i cant thank you enough for what you did wait you want me to just walk off the cliff yes you must if you are to return this is the way back home that you werent sure was going to work the first time he asked looking over the edge of the cliff and estimating a fortyfoot drop conditions are ideal right now what is more you are being called summoned if you like you cant ask for better than that please do it quickly i cannot do it for you daniel crept close to the cliffs edge he was just about to take a deep breath to prepare himself for stepping out into certain death when a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed him when the ghostly form of daniel appeared within the lychgate freya didnt hesitate she leapt forward and grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled back with all of her strength it was as if he solidified inside of her fingers suddenly she was falling backwards with him on top of her they hit the ground together she lay winded looking up at the sky turning her head she saw daniel rolling gently onto his side he saw her and smiled you saved me he said freya looked down what is it with you and clothes you pick up something wherever you go where were you elfland what are you serious its a long story i came back as fast as i could i thought you were in danger i thought i needed to save you no i managed pretty well on my own freya said really im sorry how long was i gone it was weeks to me more than a month not too sure on that point it may have been just a couple days daniel closed his eyes days only days he rolled over and sat up well im not doing that again no me neither were you in trouble really freya was just about to answer when a dark shape flew down from the sky and struck daniel square in the chest he went down the black shadowa human figureon top of him the attacking shapes face was bonewhite and bald its mouth full of sharp teeth luckily daniel had his arm up and under his attackers jaw or he wouldve had his throat already torn out slaver from those terrifying jaws was already dripping onto his collar the things left hand was pinning daniels right and its right was clutching at the side of daniels head freya looked around for something heavy to hit the attacker witha brick or a stickbut there was nothing in view frya daniel uttered halfchoked swrd lft side freya rushed over and saw daniels sword glimmering at his side she reached for its hilt to draw it out but the creature saw her she felt its hand clutch her wrist as its facedisfigured and yet still perfectly recognisableturned to her and snarled freya didnt hesitate a second she heaved with all her strength and pulled her arm away still clutching the sword she took a moment to find her balance once more during which she saw the animal shift its weight towards her then she heard five very sharp tinny bangs something seemed to explode out of the things back and she took another startled step backwards it let out a death cry of gahahahd before keeling forward and falling on its face it made no more movement under its own power daniel shifted himself from underneath the corpse and together they rolled it over so said daniel its him i was wondering if id see him again you know him it freya said i think so daniel said looking closer he had hair and not so many teeth when i last saw him but thats the guy i was talking to in the church just before i disappeared he gave me some sort of enchanted leaf then sent me out after you it was obviously a trap you carry a gun now freya asked disdainfully im not sure i like that werent you glad that i had it now freya handed daniels unused sword back to him do you know him daniel asked yes that was the person that captured me he was my tutor professor felix stowe he tricked me into thinking i was married to him that i had children with him i think he meant to starve me huh daniel gave the body a kick youll have to tell me more about that they stood over the body for a moment and then without a word between them turned and walked away freya daniel said about what we were talking about before all this we need answers for this yes answered freya although it wasnt an easy word to say i think youre right we need to go back chapter fourteen the door and the book before daniel and freya landed with a bonerattling thump right in the centre of a large chamber filled with a light so bright they had to shield their eyes when they were able to see once more the first things they noticed was that swigar and ecgbryt were not with them daniel freya are you well came the voice of swigar from the ragged opening above them yeah were fine shouted freya squinting around her not used to such a glare the chamber walls were high and straight with lots of faces so that there were no dark corners in the room the light fell from what looked to be a complicated type of chandelier in which flaming objects threw light on silver plates which then reflected the light down into the centre of the room onto a large stone dais a large door made out of iron that had rusted into a dark brickred took up one entire wall it was covered with gears and dials of all sizes some as big as the knights shields there were huge iron bars set into its iron frame that looked as if they might retract if the mechanism was worked properly freya looked back up at the hole they had fallen through it was right near the top of the ceiling and it was not the only one the whole top of the room was a honeycomb of tunnels that led down into the oddly shaped room can you reach back up to us called swigar freya said she didnt think so but that the knights should try to find another way down she described the room to them there are other tunnels leading in herelots of them and a door she said still blinking in the light very well do not move from where you are and we shall work to join you shortly worry not elingas came ecgbryts voice take heart think on what king lfred would do in a situation like yours freya rolled her eyes at that and then felt daniels hand tug at her elbow he was staring in apprehension at the walls and corners of the room shading her eyes she looked around and drew her breath in sharply darkly clad personshaped bundles huddled together in the corners of the octagonal room some of them had facesdull nearly lifeless faces in which pale eyes blinked and shifted there were too many to count at a glance and not one of them was looking their way they stood disconsolately gazing at the floor freya shuddered she felt another tug at her elbow as daniel directed her attention to the dais at the centre of the room looking closer she saw in the centre of the dais a slight figure sitting crosslegged in front of a large wooden rack he looked like a young man not quite old enough to shave his skin was smooth and so pallid it was almost white but in the direct light of the chandelier he seemed to shine brightly he was very thin and wore clothes made from what appeared to be fine soft leather his hair was long a deep reddishbrown and swept back he did not look up as they approached his eyes were fixed on a large book that rested on the wooden rack his hands were busy with a regular repetitive activity in one hand he held a large rectangular stone his other hand held nothing the scraping sound came from his fingernails dragging firmly and steadily against the rough stone freya looked closereach fingernail was large long and bone white in fact they didnt look like fingernails at all but more like horns growing from inside his fingertips the strange youth was paying them no attention only gazing in a detached almost bored manner at the book in front of him excuse us daniel said in a small voice clearing his throat without any other sign of noticing his visitors the boy put the stone to one side and picked up a thin length of embroidered cloth that lay across his lap he placed it neatly down the centre of the book gently closed it and then raised his head his expression not the least bit surprised at their appearance hello he said in a soft slow voice that flowed honeythick who might you be daniel introduced himself and freya the strangers eyes regarded each of them in turn running up and down their bodies daniel looked up at the strangely mirrored chandelier that was throwing light into the room is that daylight he asked of course the stranger replied simply turning his eyes to scrutinise his fingers once more does that come from the surface yes daniel and freya exchanged a look of excited apprehension if we could climb through it we could go home freya whispered urgently but not before we kill gad right daniel said in the same urgent whisper freya twisted her lips its a long climb the figure on the dais said absently and it spits you up in the middle of nowhere but it does lead out as you have it where exactly freya asked oh how should i know he said dismissing the question he placed an elbow on his knee and brought his chin to rest gently on his hand what realm are you from er said daniel not knowing what to say england freya said were traveling with knights named swigar and ecgbryt from niergeard who are you what brings you here the boy asked lightly brushing one of his boney nails down his cheek why have you disturbed me we didnt mean to disturb you daniel replied surprised by the coldness of the question were looking for something he said then added but we wont tell you any more until you tell us your name the boy smiled it was not a nice smile my name is nemain son of credne i am one of the aes sidhe who daniel asked the boy smiled an indulgent smile there is a reason youve not heard of me but come tit for tat quid pro quo your names hold came a bellowing voice that rolled around the room freya realised with relief that swigar had arrived there was a dusty shlufff sound and the knights bulky form slid through one of the larger holes on the other side of the room he fell next to a few of the silent mournful figures in rags who lurched out of his way he rose and took large swift strides around the dais towards the lifiendes his eyes on nemain and his spear raised ecgbryt slid into the room glanced around quickly and took his place behind him be careful elingas swigar said in a low voice it is dangerous to deal with one of the cursed races he is one of the tuath de dannanthe people of danuwho are especially treacherous they are descended of the same race as that of the fr folk but with long life comes madness their minds are not as they should becold and hard where no light shines if nemain even heard swigars barbed comments he did not show it he merely preened himself further affecting an indifferent posture they live so much longer than we ecgbryt continued that our lives seem as the span of a hawks or other housepet and the best of them think little more of us than that nemain yawned and threw a casual look around the walls where the strange people were standing in their dark tattered clothes their minds are cold and hard places like rooms of steel said ecgbryt louder directing his voice at the tuath de their passions are perverted and they do not love what is good only what is new strange and twisted some have said that they descended from the angels that were shut out of heaven when god first closed the gates they live on the earth but a short walk from hell with no knowledge of their homeland and it has driven them mad ecgbryt spat quite said nemain flipping his gaze up at them nemain grinned at him wryly with something approaching genuine humour but enough about me said the creature flowing into a crouching position so quickly that daniel completely missed the transition you say you are from england and your minders are from niergeard and whither go you all we told you that is our own concern so is it then why bother me and waste precious reading time pouting he casually pulled open the books cover and idly started flicking through the pages i was in the middle of a thought that i had been thinking for thirtytwo yearsand to suffer such needless pointless disruptionwhy it makes ones guts writhe weve disturbed you freya continued deliberately because you are in our way there is only one path downwards and its led us here to you she let the words hang in the air nemain made no movement or reply who are those people daniel asked pointing to the nearest wall do you know nemain replied airily i honestly have trouble remembering i know that almost all of them were important to me at one time or another still they have started to clutter up the place but you know how one hates to throw anything out you know that as soon as you do youll find yourself needing it you think that you wouldnt possibly need a duchess with several princesses at hand so you dispatch her only to find within a week that the eyes of anything other than a duchess simply arent penetrating enough for the purpose you need them swigar leant down and said in a low voice these are the faeries prisonerswomen he has tricked into lusting after him caught by his charms they follow him willingly to the end of the earth and then pine away when he removes his indifferent affections from them thats terrible breathed freya what about this door daniel asked taking a step towards it dont touch the door nemain yelled suddenly crouching as if to spring swigars and ecgbryts hands went to their weapons lifting them forward slightly for a long moment they were all frozen on edge ecgbryt was the first to moveat one moment he was still and then he was suddenly in motion as he dashed towards the faerie but as he reached out to grab him nemain pushed himself upwards springing over the knight nemains feet found ecgbryts shoulders and he perched there hunching just above his helmet the knight cried once in surprise at the things speed and once again in pain as the razorlike fingernails dug into his upper arm through the gaps in his chainlink armour his axe clattered to the floor before he even realised that he had let go of it ecgbryt swung his shield arm in an upward arc to knock the faerie off his shoulders but the move was anticipated and he swung at empty air as nemain slid down his back its hands looping in the large leather belt and its feet gripping the sides of the knights helmet as he tumbled downwards his feet lifted ecgbryts helmet off his head and flung it at the far wall where it smacked into the stone wall like a bullet two robed figures lurched out of its way as it fell to the ground nemain now had two feet on the ground and two hands still in the large leather belt he pulled at it with a mighty tug backwards but ecgbryt was too large and sure on his feet to fall at that so he remained standing a massive hand was now reaching around to grab at the faerie but the knight had to shift his weight to turn and nemain took the opportunity to kick one of his legs from under him ecgbryt listed on his one leg then fell slowly like a tree toppling he landed on his back arms splayed outwards and found nemain standing on top of him his feet pushing down just above the biceps with a calmly amused look on his face his shield still on his arm ecgbryt found movement nearly impossible but his right arm was free and his natural strength served him well he launched his arm forward in a swipe nemain lifted his left leg but ecgbryt was going for the right and he at last managed to lay a hand on his foe his hand circled around the faeries ankle and he jerked the leg away pulling nemain to the ground like a rag doll the fall stunned the faerie and gave ecgbryt enough time to pull himself up onto his knees crouching he jerked the slight figure up in an arc and actually swung him once around his head and flung him brutally across the room nemain flew half a dozen feet twisting in the air so that his shoulders took the blow and not his head as he pounded into the hard stone wall the faerie collapsed in a heap at the feet of a catatonic grey lady and gathered his breath a while spitting out some blood that had gathered in his mouth when he had come to his senses and raised his head he found himself looking at the metallic head of swigars spear smiling slyly he flipped himself over gingerly and sat with his back against the wall well the halffaerie said as he dabbed at his bloody lip with the back of his hand that was fun stay creature swigar growled one twitch and i shall ease the world of your burden upon it nemain slumped to the ground freya saw that his chest was moving quickly despite his calm manner the awkward way he was sitting favored the left side of his bodyhe was probably in far more pain than he let on and she felt strangely sorry for him even though ecgbryts blood still dripped from his fingers ecgbryt had not come off much better he stood with some difficulty and retrieved his helmet from the other side of the vault daniel seeing that nemain was not in much of a position to movebut keeping an eye on him anywaywalked slowly over to the large iron door that was covered in gears and wheels of different sizes although it looked rusty from a distance up close he could see the glimmer of grease and oil wherever two bits of metal touched he gave the largest wheel in front of him a turn although it was heavy it moved easily it was attached to a gear that moved with it and turned three other gears that turned another wheel which rotated a quarter turn and then stopped a small steel bolt shifted locking this wheel into place making it immobile daniel found that the bolt had fallen from another wheel which was now able to move he gave this wheel a turn but nothing happened freya came to stand beside him it looks like a puzzle she said a clockwork puzzleor a really big combination lock daniel tried moving some of the other wheels but most of them were locked the solution seemed to lay in finding some way to shift the metal tumblers from one wheel to the next in order to withdraw the large metal bolts that fixed the door into the frame freya turned and addressed nemain who was still lying against the wall this doorhow does it open the faerie smiled slyly back at her why do you suppose i would know he must know daniel said do it backwards freya suggested find out which gears are connected to the large bolts they examined the bolts but they were set far into the door underneath large panels and it was impossible to see where any of them started they did find that under each one of them was a long rank of thin grooves that indicated a toothed gear might pull it back and were further encouraged that they all looked well greased if we cant follow it from the end how can we know where to start freya asked it probably doesnt matter where it startslike one of those sliding tile puzzles we just have to make sure that everythings in the right place at the end ecgbryt come over here and help us move this one at the top oh for the wisdom of lfred the knight muttered when they had been working the problem for well over an hour they had just found that the wheels could be moved inwards and outwards to connect with different gear chains which put a whole other dimension on the problem its hopeless moaned freya its okay said daniel were just learning the rules once we learn how everything works then well be able to do it we just need to be patient freya looked over at nemain who was still being guarded by swigar nemain gazed steadily at daniel and freya when he saw freya looking at him he gave a casual smile she turned back to the door were missing something she said what about these little bolts these tumblers they fall from one wheel to the other right what if were supposed to get them all to the bottom they cant fall upwards can they maybe but look daniel stuck his finger into one of the grooves and pushed upwards see they have these little handles that let you move them back if you turn them it locks them into place just a little then you can move the wheels back to how they were if you do it right you can move them between the wheels and probably right to the other side of the door oh great perfect when did you find that out just now freya sighed and sank into a crouch no she said quietly come on ill bet were on the right track maybe we have to get all the bolts up to the top or all the way to one side or both sides or all the edges or only just the middle freya snapped we just have to keep trying i refuse to let this puzzle beat me well get the solution even if i have to guess a million times yeah okay whatever im going to look around clear my head hunt for clues or something she left daniel standing at the door and turned around rubbing her eyes what about you freya turned suddenly to one of the silent motionless women do you know anything about that door the figure did not look at her but drew away slightly no i thought not freya walked around the room searching up and down for any markings or diagramsanything that might give a hint on how to work the door but she found nothing this search took her near nemain who watched her so creepily she made a show of ignoring him then she started to examine the stone dais that the faerie had been sitting on when they first entered the room she walked around the edges then climbed up onto the dais itself it was a plain smooth surface with no designs or markings she felt frustration rising in her chest again she heard daniel give instructions to ecgbryt to turn certain wheels she thought about the carvings that they had passed to get here perhaps one of those had some sort of directions or code for the door whoever designed a door lock so complex may well have wanted to keep the solution nearby or maybe the room itself was some sort of clue she gazed around again but she couldnt see how that could be she looked up at the rays of sunlight that were being bounced into the room from some distant hole at the surface perhaps the door was there only to distract them and they had to climb now did the light seem to be getting dimmer why wasnt the air fresh what if it wasnt a riddle at all weary and frustrated she rubbed her eyes again and turned around her eyes fell on the wooden rack that held the large book the faerie had been reading the cover was plain leather with brass corner strengtheners attached to it she stepped closer and leaned over the book if youre going to touch that nemain said please clean your greasy hands freya rubbed her fingers on the bottom of her skirt to remove the oil smudges from the door gears then she very carefully opened the enormous book to the first page it was the size of a small poster and completely blank except for a short line of cramped writing in the centre if it was english she couldnt make out the letters it looked like a lot of loops and long lines freya started leafing through some of the pages the first thing she noticed were the coloursbright lively colours that tore across the yellowing pages like thunderbolts there was also a mass of detail on each pagedetails of madeup figures people buildings and landscapes each page was filled with pictures and scenes usually showing people in some action words were written in the margins and in the pictures as well many of the pages seemed to be telling a story she paused at two pages that each had six bordered images on them depicting a greenrobed figure sitting in a forest glen talking to different groups of people as they apparently passed by there was a picture of a king and a queen a group of old men in brown robes a beggar the king by himself two young maids the queen and another young man and others including a demon with sheeps horns she turned more pages one of them showed a stocky character in red wrestling with a man twice his size one page had nine identical faces on it all of them surrounded with the odd writing one page had no writing on it at allonly a picture of two people performing an intricate dance and the steps they took made it seem as if they were dancing across the page she turned the page again and heard a small wow from behind her daniel was standing there looking at the book from over her shoulder his eyes fixed on the two pages she had opened that showed a large emerald scaled serpent it was lying on the ground resting its tail curled around its clawed feet freya felt her gaze travel along that tail to where it joined the ridged back atop large haunches where enormous emerald scales shimmered with tiny detail her eye continued along the back over the crease in the book and down the long tapered neck of the beast to its long horselike face and vicious mouth the beast was examining something that turned out to be a small person holding a torch in one hand and a sword in the other the detail was astonishing each scale was rendered in precise detail the rocks that the creature gripped were starting to crumble in its mighty talons the wings looked veiny and tough the night sky was above and the shadows cast by the moon and torch described massively powerful muscles beneath the thick scales daniel took a step back and turned his face up to nemain what is it he asked it is a chronicle of our peopleour history our heroes our knowledge our genius its beautiful nemain gave a stiffnecked bow freya turned back to the book and to daniel who was staring at the page showing the beast his jaw slack and his face pale are you okay she asked how does it end daniel asked nemain didnt respond freya turned some more pages eventually coming to the end and the final spread on the lefthand pagethe next to last pagethere were four pictures of a large group of people walking down a long slope like a mountainside as they descended flames appeared each picture underneath showed the flames growing taller there was no writing the last page was a single image of a massive sheet of fire freya looked up at nemain whose smile now looked sad to her how long have you been down here daniel asked freya leafing back through more of the pages felt her heart ache it seemed so forlorn she wished she knew the language the text was written in so that she could read it she wanted to sit down with it and devour itto get lost in its glorious pages for days swim around in it to find a work of such unimaginable beauty in a place like this in the possession of a person like that how should i be able to tell four years forty four hundred time isnt important when youre a prisoner freya held her breath she tingled with the sudden feeling that she was on the brink of understanding something important and that to move or even breathe might take it from her she turned her gaze from the book to nemain and then to the wretched figures standing against the wall and you havent had anything to read except this book daniel asked nemain why would i want anything else i she started but choked i think i have it she looked at the door and smiled i think i figured it out think about it freya said to daniel and the knights the doornemainwhy would you need them need them asked daniel what do you mean i mean freya forced herself to slow down i mean why do you have them both if you have the amazingly complex door thats almost impossible to open why do you also need nemain if you have a clever faerie with razorsharp nails that can move as fast as a cheetah why do you need an enormous iron door so i dont think it is a door at all i think that its a fake everything here is for show nemain isnt a prisonerprisoners dont keep prisoners and anyway he can leave through the ceiling the tunnels we came through or even more conveniently nemains expression did not change he just stared calmly at swigars spear point in front of him raking long bony nails against the ground the large knight tightened his grip on the weapon freya moved to the door ecgbryt hold the door right here she said tapping one of the larger wheels and give it a good pull dont turn it just give it a firm pull swigar grabbed the wheel and pulled against it with all of his weight it was a long moment before anything happened and then slowly and soundlessly the whole door started to move yes freya punched the air ha daniels jaw dropped and his eyes bulged as he saw the complex mechanism move away from the large bolts which were revealed to be just metal stumps set into the stone it was never even locked it didnt need to be as long as everyone assumed it was all these poor peoplewe thought they were prisoners but they were just part of the illusion the next thing that anyone knew nemain was flying through the air towards daniel launching himself like a cat daniel registered the movement out of the corner of his eye and by the time he started to turn his head nemain was already flying towards him his clawlike hands slicing the air in front of him everything seemed to slow for daniel he tried to duck out of the way but could not move fast enough he felt the burning pain of four razorsharp fingertips rake across his upper arm he screamed and fell he landed on the wooden bookrack knocking it over and sending the enormous painted book crashing to the floor next to nemain the faerie shrieked in horror and rushed over to the book you you creased it nemain picked it up smoothed one of the bent pages and shut it just as swigars massive hand clutched him around the neck and shoulders with a fierce and brutal violence he slammed nemains chest into the ground several times the book bouncing in his hands he was stopped by freyas shouting no swigar stop please stop swigar relaxed his hold on the faerie who gave a whimpering moan and crawled back to the book he drew it close to himself and curled up into a ball whimpering slightly daniel writhed in agony on the floor he would have been crying out with pain but he couldnt catch his breath his arm hurt terribly and he was gripping it as hard as he could not wanting to let go he felt ecgbryts hands pull his own away and tug at the cloth of his shirt examining the wound freya stood above them as ecgbryt untied the strings on daniels shirt and opened it slightly he very carefully pulled daniels arm out of its sleeve there was starting to be a lot of blood ecgbryt took the water pouch from his belt and washed the arm daniel found his breath finally and let out a howl of pain ecgbryt tried to sooth him with low words while giving his arm a few very careful prods how is he swigar asked not so bad for all of that do you hear boy you fought with one of the tuatha de and will live to tell the tale not many can say as much he asked freya to fetch a small tin from his pack that contained a poulticea dry mossy substance with healing properties he laid that to one side and then pulled a small knife from his belt he cut a long strip off the bottom of one of the oilcloth blankets then he placed the mossy material over the gashes on daniels arm and bandaged it up you know lfred had his share of scars and more besides did i ever tell you ecgbryts voice dulled to a pleasant murmur as freya turned her attention to nemain dont get too close to him swigar said his spear was in his hand angled downwards once again at the creature freya stood just next to the knight and looked down at the faerie who was sobbing quietly she frowned at his pathetic shape chewing her lower lip i dont think that youre a bad person freya said to nemain you love the book because its beautiful and its good to love beautiful things she crouched down and spoke in a lower voice but daniel is worth more to us than the most expensive book in the world and you damaged him i think you know where were going and what were trying to do were trying to make sure that many more people are going to be safe from harmwere going to try to stop someone from destroying a lot more than just one beautiful bookwere trying to save people i dont know why you would want to stop us from doing that nemains sobs stilled to a broken jagged breathing allowing them to hear daniels gasps as ecgbryt helped him sit up freya looked into the face of the faerie for a little while longer and then stood she walked over to the wall where the silent women were huddled you can leave now the doors open follow us if you like there was no response so she repeated herself with large gestures and still there was no reaction to this news can they understand me freya asked turning to swigar yes but they will not listen come let us depart their tale is not ended and we can help them best by doing what we were sent to do freya joined the others at the door ecgbryt packed up his things stowed his weapons and then lifted daniel to his feet swigar backed away from the now shuddering nemain as they stood in the doorway about to pass into the large dry tunnel behind it they heard a hacking cough and the sound of a weak voice trying to be strong everything will be destroyed in time nothing lasts forever the only freedom is deathand the only escape is to hell freyas head was still spinning with the excitement of discovering the doors secret and nemains final attack so she didnt notice the peculiar walls of the new tunnel until they had been walking for several minutes bricks she exclaimed its a redbrick tunnel finally civilisation yeah groaned daniel and it smells terrible he was right in fact the farther on they went the worse the smell became it was a decaying sewagelike smell that stuck at the back of the throat plugging the nose and burning the eyes and then something odd happenedthe tunnel stopped there was no wall in front of them just a gap in the floor and beyond it a black emptiness that looked so thick you could almost reach out and touch it they walked to the edge and held their lanterns out into the inky air and tried to make out any detail possible but it was no good the light was completely eaten up by the void listen said daniel do you hear that they all stilled their breathing and strained their ears there was a distant shhshh sound like water falling a very short distance it seemed to come from somewhere in the emptiness below look exclaimed freya as she glanced downwards steps iron steps its a ladder below them were long strips of metal with griddle designs that had been fixed into the side to the sheer cliff face the step had been joined by two sturdy handrails that ran alongside them before anyone could do or say anything freya had grabbed the lantern that ecgbryt was carrying and had started down them does it go far ecgbryt asked its hard to tell i cant see the bottom came the reply from the darkness ill keep going until i run out of rungs oopokay thats it im at the bottom its a drain or a sewer or something she shouted its made of good old red bricks and mortar she held the torch above her head and found that she was standing on a ridge below which ran a dark murky water through a round channel torchlight glinted off of a part of the opposite wall showing glazed tiles were almost home she said to herself we must be the manmade bank turned slightly following the inside curve of the sewer she followed it around a few steps to see if she could find anything else dont stray too far lass she heard swigar call from above her daniels feet slapped down behind her and he picked up a torch and went towards her freya she turned to face him we made it daniel she said in a low voice look at these bricks we made it back to the real world daniel looked at freya looking at the walls around her her face eager maybe one of these tunnels leads outtheyd have to right no one builds this without a way outthats impossible freya said daniel sounding more appalled than she thought he should we cant leave now they need us were the mortals remember they cant destroy it without us theythink of everyone in niergeard surrounded by the yfelgopes and think what will happen if we fail i know that freya declared defensively i didnt say that i wanted to abandon themi only meant that maybe we dont have to backtrack all the way back to niergeard to get home fine but you have to you know finish something before its over i know that daniel okay okay lifiendes swigar said behind them come now dont wander off they regrouped well said daniel where to now the platform that created the ridge extended in two directions there were no markings anywhere neither way seemed any more promising than the other on the one hand daniel began the river or sewer or whatever looks to be going that way it leads somewhere obviously another river or an ocean or wherever those things go a water treatment plant perhaps freya suggested hopefully isnt that where all sewers go the soul box wont be in a water treatment plant daniel said its more likely to be somewhere away from anyone who could just stumble upon it i think its this wayagainst the flow but weve been following the water all this timeits what ealdstan told us to do why abandon that now the knights exchanged a look freya saw that a decision was made between them without even speaking we must divide our party swigar announced one of us will go with one of you what blurted freya but thats the worst thing that we could do we are closetoo close to go slowly if we went the wrong way our blunder could alert those guarding the heart and we would have lost the element of surprise that we desperately need for this to work but we only got this far because we all stayed together would we have gotten past the gnomes and the faerie if it were just two of us what if theres an even bigger test coming up wed either of us be able to handle it daniel said so long as we have the element of surprise freya scowled if something happened then the other two would be too far away to help we could lose everything swigar looked at her with an immovable expression what if there are more splits is each of us going to end up going alone swigar shrugged it may come to that its stupid it is what we are doing they decided that ecgbryt would go with freya and swigar with daniel they divided the provisions in their now very light packs and prepared to separate freya had a sad reluctant look on her face contradicted by daniels confident expression well meet again daniel said sticking out his hand freya hugged him be careful she said they parted and without backwards glances went their separate ways daniel and ecgbryt walked down the tunnel along with the flow of the sewer water the walkway they were on took several sharp turns and sometimes the stream they followed moved fast other times it moved slowly a few times they passed a couple of deep square pools of water but the walkway never branched they didnt go up and didnt go down just kept snaking through the darkness they had been walking for quite a long time when the section of the walkway they were on collapsed beneath their feet it felt as if a rug had been pulled from beneath themthere was only the slightest sound of crumbling stone and then they were falling daniel spent a frantic few moments clawing for handholds and kicking his feet against the shifting stone helplessly before they came to a stop are you hurt eling ecgbryt asked i dont think so daniel replied he had lost grip of his lantern but it was lying quite near him he checked himself for damages but beyond the buzz of adrenaline there was nothing yeah im fine he rolled over to pick himself up ecgbryt had already made it to his feet and was looking over the collapsed section of the bank coming to stand next to him daniel gazed up at a large scoopedout area where the path they were walking had been and beneath it a pile of rubble it looked pretty impossible to get back up it would seem stated ecgbryt that our best course would be to follow the burn with an eye to the path if it wanders from us then we will find a way to pursue it but for now we must ensure our way is fast i fancy that path fell by design not by accident and that our steps are not going unnoticed they gathered themselves quickly and moved on without a word more they were walking along in the sludge now so their progress was unsteady at first in the slippery canal but then more surethe sewage water pulled at their feet urging them faster and faster onwards freya and swigar crept up the tunnel against the flow of the water they walked in silence alert to their surroundingstrying to be ready for anything unexpected there was now more evidence of modern handiwork around them the ledge they were on turned into a metal walkway that bridged the streams beneath them and led them under stone archways and through metal pipes but their path never diverged from the narrowly railed walkway eventually after about an hour they allowed themselves to stop and rest whats it like to be a knight freya asked more to break the silence than anything else its not an easy life swigar answered there are hardships and uncertainties at the root of most events in the warriors life is death it is our stock in trade for payment a merchant will provide goods a nobleman will provide services for the tribute you give him a warrior will deliver death were you always a knight very nearly always i was young when i entered into the service of my dryhten my lord i was just thirteen winters but i had seen much already my father was a scribe in eoferwic one of the capitals of britain in my time a wonderful city he was a church mana holy man at that time a great heathen army from the danish lands arrived and settled in the area promising peace and trade with those who lived there the greedy men clamored to be the first to trade with them they stayed there for a week and when all the goods were sold the danesmen produced swords and started attacking the lands to the south they raided eoferwic killing many including our king forcing the survivors to barter for surrender the vikings lived in my city in the homes of the men they had killed they piled the dead bodies in the wooden church and set fire to it he bowed his head my father was one of those in the burning pile of the dead swigar said no more and after a moment freya said im sorry i had a choice then swigar continued i could stay and help rebuild and fortifyperhaps take over my fathers work as i had started to apprentice to himbut my heart was filled with anger so in despair i fled south i came across news that the king of wessex thelred and his brother lfred were gathering forces to reclaim the land that was taken and so i sought them out and joined their warband i do not regret the road that i took it has brought me honour of many kinds and i believe i have brought honour to my land my king and my god with my service but i have learned that a man cannot be just a soldier if he is to remain a man and not a monster destroying evil is never enoughyou must also be willing to build good swigar fixed his eyes on the tunnel up ahead glancing up freya saw a shimmering gleam in his eyes that is my one fear swigar stated that throughout my life i have not built sufficient good swigar said no more only rose and started gathering his things morosely freya joined him and they continued their journey the path gave a sharp turn along a wide channel that fed into an even larger river and they were forced to walk away from the main waterway there didnt appear to be any other choice the large tile channel looked fairly unscalable and there was no visible walkway on the other side freyas unease at this new tack quickly evaporated when she noticed a sparkle in the distance swigar she whispered lower your light for a minute he did so and she shaded her eyes from the light it still gave i think that theres a light up ahead it might be electric electric its a sort of light made out of its kind of scientific its a light made by machines i see sort of enchanted yes they walked on slowly drawing closer to the dim light freyas gaze was fixed on it as if it might disappear if she even shifted her eyes it was a lightbulba single naked uncovered bulb her stomach was tense with what she supposed was anticipation though it felt more like a giddy dread finally they were standing underneath it and freya let out a long ragged sighand then found herself gasping in the cold dank air i can feel it too said swigar what the power in this place as if all thingsthe walls the air the wateras if they all wanted to hold you down to pull you back for whatever reason these things are trying to keep us away from what lies beyond either trying to guard it or perhaps guard us we will walk carefully from here onwards it may have been swigars words but freya did feel that her feet moved more reluctantly than before that lightbulb was the first of many they could see more in the distance they reached the next and found the others closer together spaced maybe three or four meters apart in a single line above their walkway that neither swerved nor branched off into other directions their presence was staggering to freya not only was this a place where people had come at least one person had come regularly enough to replace the bulbs when they burnt out she walked beneath them counting as she went finding comfort in their spaced regularity she sent her gaze farther along counting the bulbs in the distance when she saw something that stopped her in her tracks gasping she took a step back falling against swigar what is it he asked i thought i saw someonea person dressed in white they just darted across the the walkway up there but they were so quick i donti mean im not sure what i saw they startled me stay behind me swigar said they continued more slowly with swigar cautiously leading a wideeyed freya eventually coming to an intersection there were two iron walkways that went to the right and to the left both were nearly identical and both led to enormous iron doors i think theyre pressure doors freya said if the water gets too high then theyll stop it from getting in you open them by turning the wheel in the middle she stood looking at them critically well she decided the person i saw was moving from right to left so i guess we should maybe take that door she pointed to the door on their left swigar stroked his beard and then nodded he put his large hands on the wheel in the middle of it and gave it a mighty turn it gave and opened without a sound revealing a man standing just inside holding a large book open in front of him he was dressed in a heavy creamcoloured robe that was slightly open to show a white robe made of some lighter more comfortable cloth he was old with shoulderlength white hair and sharp features he raised his eyebrows in surprise hello he began but was cut off by a cry from swigar devil the knight shouted leveling his spear and pulling his arm back ready to strike no the old man flinched and dropped his book he leapt to the side just in time to stop being skewered by swigars spear but not far enough to avoid it altogether it tore into his side causing him to cry out in agony he dropped to his knees as swigar brought his spear back again quick lifiende swigar urged is it gad it is are you sure i mean im certain hurry now before he can recoverbefore he can speakkill him what but that wontdaniel has to he may have done so already in any case itll keep him down hurry now freya looked down at the old man blood seeping from his side no ii dont think swigar pulled his spear back and lunged for another attack but it was the worst thing he could have done he thrust the spear forward just as gad leapt aside missing him narrowly with unbelievable speed gad gripped swigars spear bent the top end of it back snapping it off completely andgripping the head by its splintered shaftthrust it back at the knight with incredible force it penetrated his mail coat and lodged deep into his chest astounded winded and now mortally wounded swigar made a grab at the frail old man who ducked and dodged out of his way gad then delivered a blow to swigars chest which drove his spearhead farther into him and caused him to fall backwards against the metal door opposite freya cried out and dashed to swigars side swigar moved his lips trying to speak but only blood came from his mouth exploding at first and then in cascades as he fought for breath what have you done freya said turning angrily what have you done hurry gad said his hand moving back to his bloodied side i must talk to you you are not out of danger yet chapter fifteen gad gad took freya by the arm and pulled her gently across the doorway she now found herself standing at the entrance to a large luxuriously furnished roomcompletely out of place in a sewer and oddly unreal like a movie set or a french palace the room was several storeys high and square with a multitiered floor the walls were lined with bookcases and electric lights in extravagant sconces deep redpatterned carpets were laid around the room atop white marble floors expensivelooking furniture filled the interiorgrand armchairs plush couches wide tables and a long deskall beautifully carved and polished to a shine there was a grand chandelier overhead an enormous fireplace in one wall and even an ancient tv set the kind that looked like a small cabinet with a screen on it let go of me freya said pulling her arm away from gad i really mean you no harm he said bending down before her i must talk to you for a few moments do you want to sit down are you hungry thirsty i do so want to help then help swigar hes still alive he believe me said gad standing up and moving to an armchair that no good would come of that you saw his reaction upon seeing me is violence the first response of a reasonable man but youre evil freya said uncertainty creeping into her voice yes gad said sitting i assume thats what they would have told you thats just one of the lies of niergeard please sit down and allow me to explain cautiously freya approached and stood near the chair opposite she cast a look back at swigar please she said before its too late help him yes i will but first i must see to the wound that he gave me gad told her indicating the gash at his side come inside there are things i must talk to you about reluctantly freya followed him inside i dont blame you for your trepidation gad said with a wince he leaned forward and drew out a wooden box that was underneath the chair its not your fault i know youve been told all types of lies about melies that left no room for question lies that you thought could not be challenged what lies you control the yfelgopes youve had niergeard surrounded for decades i was there the last time you attacked i was almost killed gad brought the box up onto his lamp and opened it it contained bandages and bottles he shook his head lies spun with the threads of truth are always the hardest to disbelieve yes i control the yfelgopes and with them ive surrounded and attacked niergeardseveral times now in fact but why have i done so for what purpose can you tell me do you know because youre ev no gad snapped thumping the box with his palm the exact specific reason no one is simply good or evil entirely you cant tell me can you you have no idea gad spat these words angrily his face turning red he jerked forward in his chair causing freya to flinch stupid girl he spat at her freya clutched the back of the chair wanting to run but now afraid to gradually however gad leaned back into his chair and placed a hand over his eyes forgive my temper he said i have been unjustly imprisoned by ealdstan for hundreds of years and i have forgotten my manners it is unfair to you i know and i apologise he turned his attention back to the box and withdrew some sheets of sterile cotton and a bottle he unbuttoned his shirt and shrugged it off his shoulders then set about cleaning the wound yes ive raised an army and intend to crush niergeard but there is more than one reason that a man may revolt against the established order they told you i was an oppressor but under what circumstances would they tell you anything else authoritarian regimes need scapegoats to blame for their own mistakes youve been there youve seen what kind of place it is the people are wasted lifeless spiritless they want to die but they keep hanging on and whose fault is it not theirs for the choices theyve made not ealdstans for deceiving them no its minethe evil wizards yes they told you i was an oppressor but what if im a freedom fighter a revolutionary gad satisfied that his cut was clean rubbed some balm onto another sheet of cotton and removed a roll of bandages from the box niergeard is a hostile occupying force in this land a malignant dictatorship they want to control us make us live in the past with them give up our identities our hopes and dreamsmake us something less than human deny us of our basic humanity our chance to be glorious i know what youre try freya began but was cut off again would you help me with this he asked could you hold this bandage just behind the shoulder here its rather hard to reach freya cautiously rose and helped gad bandage himself let me ask you a question was it your idea to come here to go on some sort of mysterious quest underneath the surface of the earth freya didnt answer but gad didnt need her to of course it wasnt gad continued winding the bandage around his chest with difficulty imagine asking that of a child they tricked you they blindfolded you with their lies told you all sorts of fantastic tales until your head started spinning and when you were all mixed up they took off the blindfold and pushed you where they wanted you to go i do give them credit for their cleverness but the fact remains that they perpetuate a sick twisted perverted doctrine designed to extinguish all of the brilliant and wonderful flames of humanity the truth will always come outi believe that and that is why i stand against niergeard for the sake of all the people in this world who are powerless to do so the two regarded each other silently freya sat staring at gad who had raised his hands and now held them steepled beneath his chin it wont work freya said now uncertainly my friends are going after your heart right now as we speak if youre trying to twist my mind around or anything it wont work gad pinned his bandage down and settled back into his chair with a sigh yes i understand that he shook his head fortunately i have prepared for all of this and they are doing precisely what they must do in order to help me indeed let us see how theyre getting on a remote control appeared in gads hand and he pointed it at the antique television across the room he pressed a button and there was a click a hum and a bluishwhite picture appeared on the screen the canal that daniel and ecgbryt traveled along sloped down down and down just as the banks beside them rose higher above their heads the muddy foulsmelling water rushed ahead of them sloshing around their calves as it passed so far the water hadnt risen just kept getting faster it was slow going since the brickwork underfoot was slippery with sludge daniel wondered if they were on the right track but this felt right he felt a tug inside of him as if an invisible fishing line were pulling his rib cage forward then they saw the lights at first they became aware of a blue glow growing around them as they walked they saw the edge of a wall ahead of them come into sharp relief by the dim blue light as they got closer daniel was aware of a kind of sizzling sound and when they rounded the corner of the illumined wall they could see where the light was coming from in two long rows on each side of the wall were oddlooking orbs stuck on the end of black poles about a foot in height they gave off a gentle radiance daniel stared into one of the orbs and could just make out the shape of a slowly moving flame but nothing else enchantments ecgbryt stated ill say daniel replied they walked cautiously between the strange lights which made an odd buzzing sound but no heat the glow seemed to get in behind the eyeballs and sit in the back of the head daniel shuddered but kept going trying to find comfort by telling himself they were probably on the right track if they were starting to see magic lights guiding them they turned another corner and were met with an incredibly strong wind blowing across them it forced daniel to blink several times to close his eyes and when he opened them again he saw they were at the entrance to an enormous and magnificent cavern shaped like a pyramid it looked almost half a mile to the other side the stream they were following emptied into a pool of many levels about a dozen concentric squares they could see down almost to the bottom because the blue orbs of light were placed on each step fizzing gently underwater and still giving off the radiant blue glow on the ground around the square pool tall buttresses and columns supported a roof that mirrored its depth and dimensions everything was covered in glazed tiles mostly white but patterned with other colours at the far end of the pool a large column rose like a lectern in a church unlike all the other surfaces they could see this was pure blue stone that was tinged with ripples of white light from a hole in the ceiling fell upon its centre and upon a large manyfaceted box made of crystal that threw the light in all directions this must be it daniel said in an excited whisper to ecgbryt that must be the soul box then came a scraping sound from both sides of the room daniel turned in horror as he heard the distinct and familiar scrabbling sound and the first of the yfelgopes came into view hurry daniel ecgbryt cried we must run they started around the pool at a sprint daniels hand found his sword as ecgbryt unslung his shield and hefted his axe ah good said gad theyve arrived lets see if we can he pressed a couple more buttons on the remote control and the image shifted zoomed in and panned to the right freya realised that she was seeing a fight taking placeinside of what looked like a giant pyramid she picked out ecgbryt first the enormous knight swinging his axe at a cluster of yfelgopes he was mostly just knocking them into the pool in order to move forward as fast as possible he was standing in front of and trying to protect daniel who was following behind him sword drawn occasionally daniel would stab or slash at an yfelgop who had rebounded off ecgbryt but not fallen into the pool well said gad thats going nicely nicely freya asked worried now what is it is that room some sort of trap no not at all if they do fight their way through my warriors and make it to the box they will hold power over my soul so arent you worried about them getting through freya asked worried no not in the least gad said smiling warmly at her in fact nothing would make me happier do you think that ive truly earnestly been trying to stop you you were never in any real danger coming here did you think you were gad was wiping the blood off of his hands with a rag no my dear the truth is that i want everyone to succeed thats the whole point of being on this earth isnt it to succeed i want daniel to be a hero i need him to be one the world needs heroes who are willing to fight and even kill for what they believe his actions will help me to free millions of people all over the world people just like you who want to be free but dont know how towho dont even know that they arent free so it has all been a trap freya answered hotly my dear thats what ive been trying to tell you said gad but its not my trap you have been under their control far longer than mine in fact my control releases you from theirs youve let niergeard rule your life since before you even heard its name but it doesnt have to be that way now how can i trust you how do i know youre telling the truth gad shifted in his chair and pointed across the room do you see that door over there its just like the one you came into the room by that door will lead you out of these cavescontinue straight on until you see the light of day and feel the fresh air on your face its not locked there are no guards on the other side all you have to do is turn the handle and leave at any time that door will lead you home the blue column was now looming over daniel he could see a stone staircase that led up it the yfelgopes werent coming as fast now the two had managed to create a little circle of protection around them which the yfelgopes were reluctant to enter some had dived into the pool and were swimming across to try to meet them on the far side but their weapons and scraps of armour made it hard for them they raced onwards ecgbryt dealt easily with the yfelgopes before them and then they had a clear stretch to the column sprinting as hard as they could across the tile floor they sprang over the corner of the pool and made for the towering stone column at a dead run daniel could feel something pushing him onwardsthis must be how heroes felt when they were performing amazing deeds there was no doubt inside of him his thoughts were clear he knew exactly what he had to do and how to do it and as he reached the first of the stone steps he knew that he would do what he came to do go daniel ecgbryt shouted get to the box he kicked an yfelgop that was climbing out of the pool back into it daniels feet pounded up the steps taking two at a time he arrived breathless at the top the crystal box was nearly as big as he was he could see something black fluttering around in it there was a small doorway secured only by a latch he flicked it open and peered inside in the box was a creature that had a bulbous fleshy body long spidery legs and wide flat insect wings it had a stubby head and a long pointed needlelike mouth it was jumping around like a fish out of water banging into the sides of the box its legs werent strong enough to hold it and it was too heavy to fly its fleshy abdomen pulsed steadily like a heartexactly like a heart this was gads heartan ugly black fluttering thing the sickness in daniels stomach deepened when he opened his eyes and looked down from the high tower to see ecgbryt fighting some distance below him this isnt what heroes do daniel thought pressing his lips firmly together they dont flinch at the last he seized control of his emotions tensed his muscles and turned back to the box heroes are strong he forced his hand to grip the doors latch heroes fight against all odds he sheathed his sword and drew the stone knife that ealdstan had given him heroes destroy anything that is evil without thinking about it any longer he flipped open the door spotted the fluttering heart thing and plunged the knife into it freya looked across at the door do you mean it this leads out of the caves absolutely what if we kill you then you can still leave obviously freya turned and looked at swigar lying motionless just outside the door they came in by and what about swigar its too late for him gad said hes dead im sorry you may have thought of him as a friend but in time you will come to realise that he was your jailer you will have to leave him here you said youd help him i was not fast enough im sorry we talked too long it was selfdefense if it helps to look at it like that freya choked back tears she could cry for him later she thought about what gad had said about sunlight and fresh air she went to the door and tried the handle it moved easily in her hand but what about the people in niergeard she asked turning do you really care about them freya you are free do you understand this is what you wanted for this daniel gets to be a hero and you get to go home you both win you both get what you gad jerked in his chair his body tensed rigid his muscles fighting against each other as if having a seizure his head banging from side to side it took freya a moment to realise what was happening and then it struck herdaniel must have done it she stood unsure what to do wringing her hands she looked towards the large door that gad had told her was the exit did she dare gad made heaving vomiting motions but expelled nothing he looked in unimaginable agony for long moments he rolled and writhed on the floor and then finally became still curled up in a ball panting exhausted gad pushed himself up and stood swaying just in front of freya his eyes were halfclosed and he seemed not able to see her he turned and walked to a small table set next to the wall which had a pitcher on it he poured clear liquid from that into a small tumbler and took a drinka few sips at first and then the whole glass he clutched at his throat as if it hurt him and then started to laugh i forgot how painful living could be what just happened freya asked gad turned to her with a smile and sweat on his brow daniel has succeededhe has destroyed the vessel that housed my immortalityand it has returned to me i dont understand i am mortal nowim back in the game a long time ago i placed my mortality into the body of an undying beast so that as long as it lived i would continue to in this way i became much like your friends the knights walking this world yet always removed from it now with the sands of my existence once again flowing i can do anything freya stood blinking at him so we lost gad shrugged maybe from your point of view but thats a rather simplistic view to take this is just the movement from one state into another it is neither better nor worsejust different freya stood confused so what happens now that is for you to decide you may attempt to complete the mission that ealdstan charged you withto kill me and then return homeor you may simply return home now ii dont know what to do freya said and her eyes went to the body of swigar still lying dead do you want to kill me gad asked her no she cried her eyes filling with tears at once i dont want anyone to die i just want to go home whatwhat am i going to tell the others i can help you with that follow me freya walked as fast as she dared down the almost pitchblack corridor the lamp from niergeard that she still carried with her seemed to be glowing dimmer now and she couldnt always make out the ground in front of her she thought that she saw two spots of light ahead of her like two dim stars she dipped her lamp to see better and watched as the bobbing lights came nearer she started to see outlines forming in the gloom like the silvery outlines of a ghost freya she heard daniel call ecgbryt daniel she hurried towards them are you okay daniel asked after freya released him from a hug i found gads soul and killed it its done we can go back to ealdstan and hell let us go we dont need to do that i think theres an exit nearby really how can you tell daniel asked i passed it on the way to find you here wheres swigar ecgbryt was already standing over her and peering into the darkness behind her hes back there come on ill show you freya led them both back the way she had come to an intersection of pipes and ducts and there in the centre of the crossroads lay swigars body his broken spearshaft beside him the spears head still buried in his chest is he not sleeping ecgbryt asked to himself can he not be woken yet he stepped forward and bent over the body and touched the cold face then turned to freya with an expression that nearly shattered her she was already crying and through her misty eyes she saw a look on ecgbryts face like a wounded dog that had been kicked in the belly and it didnt know why how did this happen he asked this should not have been possible freya wanted to break down and tell him everything she took a deep breath and felt her stomach tighten till it was as hard as steel she heard the words come out we ran into gad and they fought swigarhe fought long and hard i thought they would go on forever then gad grabbed the spear and shoved it into his chest andit was over i was terrified gad came up to mei wanted to run but i couldnt and he stood over me and thenthen he grabbed at his chest and keeled over he started spitting up blood and theni think he was dead that must have been when youdid whatever you did daniel daniel and ecgbryt just looked at her with impassive faces for a while she couldnt tell if they were buying it or not she held her breath and prayed for one of them to say something anything where is gad now ecgbryt asked looking around hes back there freya said indicating one of the paths she continued hurriedly swigar wasnt quite dead yet and he walked this way with me but then he stopped and died diddid he say anything at the end ecgbryt asked anything about me freya felt a sweat immediately break out this wasnt in the script i dontno he didnt he was really weak and we were hurrying to get to you im sorry ecgbryt im so sorry ecgbryt turned back to swigars body wela broor wela an bealocwealm u habbe caru ond anlipnes is min he sighed did i fail you when you needed me most my hand too slow to rise with yours did you want for me in your last moment did your heart cry my name or was thought of me absent i am sorry that i gave so much cause for you to speak against me in all the years we walked side by side ecgbryt pulled the body of swigar by its arms out of the rank and reeking sewer water and onto a dry stretch of paving and set about arranging the dead knights clothing and armour so your dear spear is broken and where is your shield will you not fight again in this world swa swacontinue the fight in the next world and tarry there until i come join you and i vow before you now never again to speak word of our past adventures the uttering of them will taste always as stale water and dry ash if you are not to share such food of remembrance with me no more will ecgbryt drink to the health of dead kings or raise a horn to the memory of forgotten battles my head will not again be warmed with thoughts of past glories and triumphs but will be lit only with ideas of future conquest and the defeat of enemiesof returned bloodshed and vengeful violence we have traveled many roads you and i long and dangerous roads but the way always seemed shorter when i walked with you and burdens lighter ecgbryt placed a massive hand around the dead bodys belt and hefted the enormous mass onto his back and across his shoulders so come with me a short distance yet and i will honour this which you have been left behind you are not so heavy for the greater part of you yet has gone on he turned to daniel and freya i would like to inspect gads body myself no ecgbryt freya urged you have to help us get out of here first there might still be yfelgopes around here very well ecgbryt said which way did you think was the passage out swigars body though it would have been almost cripplingly heavy to anyone else did not slow ecgbryt down much at all he walked silently behind daniel and freya as they moved down the new passage which wound on with many curves and corners but was brick and piping all the way along this was the way that gad had directed freya to go and she prayed that it wouldnt be another trap the possibility that it was actually the way home however pulled her onwards walking quickly ahead of the other two pausing to wait for them at the turns so that they wouldnt lose sight of her at one corner she paused long enough to talk to them do you see something up ahead freya asked i cant tell yeah maybe something shining as they went farther daniel could start to see the ghostly image of a wall in the distance were almost there said freya they kept their feet and moved onwards white light was streaming past the walldaylight freya realised with awe for the first time in a month or more they were seeing daylight projected onto the brick wall of the corridor they rounded the corner and had to stop their eyes dazzled by the light that fell through a large grille they both gasped and shielded their eyes the sun said freya wiping tears off her cheeks it hurts said daniel surprised ecgbryt flinched and squeezed his eyes shut i have not seen the sun in over one thousand years i do not remember that it stung so they moved forward out of the direct path of the light and stared up through the grille can you see anything daniel jumped up and down a couple of times to try to get a better view no just the sky feel that fresh air they stayed underneath the grille for several short seconds fixated before their fears pricked them onwards come on freya said it cant be far now but the next turning revealed a plain brick wall and nothing else they stared at it blankly and it stared back at them just as blankly its like a bad joke daniel said freya was in turmoil gad had lied to her she had wanted to believe in escape so badly she had wanted to put this terrible world and all that had happened to them far far behind her but nownow there was no telling what else theyd have to go through in order to get back home again maybe we can break through the grate freya said maybe we can call out to some a high piercing scream cut through the air yfelgopes ecgbryt said we need to turn around and prepare ourselves no good can come from fighting in a corner wait said daniel wheres the mortar what theres no mortar between the bricks its just a pile of stacked bricks i think we can break it down skittering footsteps and scraping clatter was heard from down the zigzagging corridor ecgbryt set swigars body down propping it against the wall he unslung his shield from his back and hefted his axe he hunkered down ready to meet any attackers be mindful ecgbryt said i shall protect you as best i can but i may not be able to halt them all daniel drew his sword and shoved its point in between the crack of two bricks it slipped in easily enough all the way down the long tip he wriggled it gently from side to side causing the wall to bulge towards him its coming he pulled his sword back out and with it a stream of bricks and damp soil he felt a hand on his arm and he was yanked backwards sharply losing his balance and falling lengthways on the ground as the large old bricks fell to a crashing heap at his feet freya was lying beside him thanks he said picking himself up dust was billowing around them the upper half of the wall had given way turning into a large pile of bricks and dirt behind the wall was more dirt dark brown muddy earth no freya said quietly despair finally sinking into her heart its not fair never mind freya daniel said consolingly well find hold on said freya climbing forward on the dirt heap i can see light what up through here its she thrust her arm into the dirt and pulled a small clump of mud and grass came with it revealing a dim blue corner of sky hurry help me they dumped their packs and leapt forward clawing clods of dirt away freyas fingers dug into a mesh of fine white fibers which turned out to be the roots of grass that hung like a curtain in front of her she started ripping through it tearing it apart as much as she could ecgbryt daniel said turning to the knight who still stood weapons at the ready come on help us not today young daniel young freya this is where our paths part daniel also stopped what why your work under the skin of the earth may be finished but mine is not i must toil in the darkness awhile longer yet no ecgbryt freya moaned the image of gad stabbing swigar played over in her head if you stay here she choked im not leaving daniel exclaimed ecgbryt i want to stay with you daniel you cant shut up freya this was always the plan i was going to help you get home and then stay myself i want to be a knight i want to destroy evil daniel thats not i hate the world hate it im not going back i refuse ecgbryt knelt in front of daniel you must go he said you do not belong here those words cut daniel to the heart dont say that i would not want you here i dont care daniel said eyes hot with tears i want me here just then the first of the yfelgopes rounded the corner at high speed howling at them ecgbryt rose and with a swift motion brought his axe up and into its jaw go ecgbryt commanded them daniel drew his sword and went to stand near ecgbryt you better hurry freya freya looked beseechingly at ecgbryt who nodded at her and then turned his back gritting her teeth freya dug up towards the light she pushed with her legs and pulled herself forward just as a shower of loose dirt and pebbles fell upon her head she was completely buried except for her forearms and ankles she couldnt move her legs enough to kick herself forward nor could she move her shoulders to pull herself out worse she couldnt breathecool damp earth completely covered her face she flailed her arms as much as she could trying to find something to grab but found nothing twisting turning and scrunching herself together and thrusting herself forward like an inchworm she finally managed to get her head and shoulders out into the open air and blinding light her arms were next and then the rest she stood blinking although bright to freya the sky showed it was only evening she was in a field with a small clump of trees nearby and a large stone building just beyond that she looked down at her feet on the ground and the loose earth that she had climbed through she could hear nothing but the sound of the birds in the distanceno sound from daniel or ecgbryt and then with a lurch the ground beneath her collapsed along the line of the corridor they had been walking down it made an almost indescribable sounda sort of muffled basso profundo crump she watched the cavedin earth for any further movement and spied something pale and wriggling frantically it was daniels arm fast as a shot freya was over there and pulling at him with all her might she wasnt strong enough to shift him much at first so she started desperately to dig and claw away the dirt around him she managed to uncover his faceshe had almost been standing on itwhich allowed him to breathe with huge grateful gasps and from there they worked together to extract him completely ecgbryt was his first word still spitting dirt from his lips ecgbryt is he still down there freya asked alarmed she wasnt sure she had the strength to dig again where do you think no daniel sputtered he pushed me he pushed me away when the walls started caving in he could have pulled me towards him instead maybe not maybe as freya searched for words daniel shook his head i saw his face his eyes he didnt want me with him he didnt want me excuse me came a voice from behind them but who might you be they spun around and found a boy a tall lanky teenager with dustybrown hair staring at them in amazement where did you come from freya daniel whispered what do we do now epilogues now so freyawhere do we go daniel asked studying the board that had the train timetable posted on it it looks like we take this one here said freya thats the village that the church is in at least well have to ask around after that they stood still staring at the map both thinking the same thing i hope it works freya said voicing the thought the knights had to negotiate a labyrinth just to get to niergeard in the first place remember well well just have to see it may be a moot point anyway we may not be able to get under the arch well manage it somehow daniel said the other option i see is to head back up to scotland and try to find where we came out wed have to navigate the wild caves again which may be hard but still possible daniel looked at the clock underneath the departures board weve got about forty minutes shall i grab some food for us freya nodded and gave him some money ill be on the platform she said get me a coffee as well freya stepped through the automatic doors and found an empty bench she sat and bent over putting her head in her hands she squeezed her eyes shut and rubbed her temples still not quite believing that she was about to do what they were doinggoing back to niergeard all the years of her life from now to the last time she was there were about trying to put it behind herliterally and figuratively and if it didnt work shed go back home after seeing the date shed found that shed been under stowes influence for over a week no doubt shed been reported missing if that is she was even enrolled at oxford university she realised now that she wasnt sure where stowes enchantments started and where they ended it was possible that every tutorial that shed had with him and every other student shed shared them with had been illusions she shook her head trying to dislodge the dreadful thought from her mind itd be worth getting in contact with her parents somehow though she just couldnt think of a way to do it without jeopardising their missionwhat shed come to think of as her mission everything was traceable these days and they were probably already on a dozen cctv recordings although daniel had hed said taken her along routes where there was less risk of that how and why hed come to consider and accommodate for that she meant to ask him excuse me miss a female voice asked freya looked up squinting at an officiouslooking form silhouetted against the sunlight she raised a hand to shield her eyes yes are you freya reynolds her eyes fell upon a badge that read thames valley police um no sorry im not sorry the policewoman nodded could you step this way please she held up an arm indicating the station forecourt um whats this about please step this way if you dont mind im waiting for someone and our train will be here soon i understand step this way no options left to her freya stood with legs that shook like jelly it would be a mistake to say too much without knowing what the police knew she had to keep her storywhatever that would be simple and opaque it would be work but she had spent most of her life keeping secrets the trick was to always keep a few things in reserve so it seemed like all her lies had been broken through when it was really just a single layer of them if need be she would throw them stowe and the abduction she would have to rewrite that however but she was certain that she could play the traumatised victim in shock after her abduction who was irrationally trying to escape to anywhere it didnt have to make senseshe just had to stick to it she thought all of this in just the few steps it took to get back into oxfords main terminal building once inside though she stopped and drew a breath trying to hide the plunging feeling that she felt in her stomach daniel was standing in the middle of the forecourt flanked by two security guards another jacketed policeman and another younger man in a cheap grey suit and short military haircuta police detective straight from tv he was standing next to a man in a white shirt and tie with a nervous look on his face daniel wore a placid resigned expression but his clothes and hair were ruffled showing signs of a struggle his hands were behind his back presumably handcuffed freya felt the policewoman at her side grip her arm just under the armpit and at her elbow whats this about she asked right this way whos that i dont know him the man in the cheap suit turned to the nervous man in the necktie is there a place we could talk in private the man his eyes wide and blinking at daniel and freya nodded and turned they followed him to a door marked staff only this led them to a narrow corridor with many doors branching off the nervous man opened one of them using a key the detective put a hand on his shoulder it may be a little crowded in there he said with a slight scottish lilt you all better wait outside ill call when i need you again you two he said indicating daniel and freya inside if you please exchanging a glance they entered the room which was mostly bare except for a stack of chairs and two tables one upended onto the other a coffee vending machine that also advertised soup leaned dusty and in disrepair against the committee grey wall all of this was lit by two luminous strip lights the detective pulled a couple chairs off the stack and placed them before daniel and freya please take a seat he said taking a chair for himself its hard to sit with my hands cuffed daniel said dont be a baby the detective said daniel sat isnt this odd the detective asked all these sorts of buildings have odd little rooms like this wouldve been an office in more prosperous times or more likely a break room for the ticket tellers but money gets tight ticket telling becomes automated and the room is forgotten about i blame the tories socialism is a small price to pay to keep everyone fed what use is the free market economy if children go hungry economists dont know a thing about economy economy is feeding three children on the dole he sniffed and looked around him funny thing is they cant even use this space for storage regulations only allot a certain percentage of space for storage and janitorial if they wanted more space to store things theyd have to build an extension or get an act of parliament isnt that mad daniel and freya just sat looking at him blankly daniel sitting forward slightly in his chair sorry the presumed detective said i do tend to rattle on when i get nervous gotta bit of irish in me do you two still not recognise me they stared harder at him are you a detective or something freya asked his face not even vaguely familiar ah no there you have me im not a detective but then i never said i was but i am a policeman just a little outside of my jurisdiction ha that sounded very hollywood but seriously he said reaching into his jacket pocket he produced a flat black wallet and showed them the silver badge that displayed a thistle which was clipped to the outside heres my badge and my id which is going to give the game away unless you have any more guesses he seemed to want an answer so freya shook her head the detective flipped open the wallet and held his identification card up close to them they peered forward and read his name think back about eight years ago alex simpson daniel said yes yes of course you aye i only bloody found you didnt i wandering in our backfields covered in dirt the famous lost english schoolchildren we all had to sit through a fortyfive minute talk by a policeman about stranger awareness because of you two i wasnt much older than you so im not hurt that you didnt recognise me but what are you doing here freya asked been looking for the two of you havent i and itshere daniel stand up i can take those off of you now he fished a key ring out of his pocket and unlocked daniels handcuffs next time an officer of the law asks for a word dont take a swing at him alright as i was saying its been bloody hard tracking you both down daniel you were off the grid naturally but freya you were in the system but unlocatable a week weve been hunting for you ive managed to keep it quiet but your parents are beside themselves what happened to you daniel and freya looked at each other im sorry said freya why are you here again alex slapped his head im sorry i forgot niergeard im here about niergeard business how do you know about niergeard daniel asked agog its a long story ill fill you in more later but for now suffice to say im one of those above ground that exist to look after and care for the knights im picking up where my father left offlike he did with his its one of those generational things goes right the way back to the fortyfive daniel and freyas mouths hung open yes secret society and all that well its a little more complex than that but more about that later first i need to tell you that things are developing listen he said and told them about dunbeath morven the trolls and the dragon that sounds bad daniel said its worse than you think alex said dragons he puffed out his cheeks and blew his breath out shaking his head anyway whats happened with you actually freya said bracing herself theres something i need to tell both of you no hold that thought alex said we should push on you can tell me in the car the car aye weve got a long drive ahead of us come with me youre not under arrest just helping me with my enquiries if anyone asks they left to find the two police officers still in the hallway the security guards and the nervous man in the shirt had wandered off somewhere thanks chappies alex said to the officers theyve agreed to come with me and my associate i owe you one the policemen just nodded and walked away alex shook his head the english he muttered under his breath he led them out of the train station they spotted the police car as they started down the steps there was a man inside of it in the passengers seat who made to get out when he saw them the door opened and he stepped out and as he did so the car rocked with himhe was evidently very large he straightened up to his full height about seven feet tall and looked at them from over the cars roof daniel and freya stopped and looked at the man hardly believing their eyes alex flashed a smile let me introduce my associate he said or have you met him already it cant be its not hello young daniel and young freya ecgbryt it was indeed the knight but now dressed in a blue uniform and with a much tidier beard and closely trimmed hair that stuck out from a policemans hat swa swa its ecgbryt just so he said grinning what say you are you ready to rejoin the battle two weeks earlier gad gazed down at robin ploughwright from the throne he sat upon he didnt like elves as a rule and had plans to be rid of them for good although they could be relied upon they were unpredictable he had overcome his antipathy because they were perfect for just these sorts of jobsdistraction and detention gad made a gesture permitting him to leave robin had walked a few steps when he turned with respect he said twitching i know i shouldnt question never have before but i must ask why not simply kill them or detain them in a more conventional manner gad rose a hand to his chin kill daniel and freya the thought truly hadnt occurred to him any more than removing chess pieces from his own side of the board halfway through a game he liked themthey were so manipulable malleable really robin he said grinning is that any way to treat a friend a short note about language when the british monks first started to record the history and literature of their land they wrote them in the old english language but used the latin alphabet instead of the pagan one this was mainly for practical purposes since latin was spoken in nearly every european country at that time usually by other priests and monks the roman system of writing was convenient economical and comprehensible to foreigners the problem however was that a few sounds used in english as it was at that time didnt exist in latin and therefore had no letters to express them to fix this they decided to use the letters for those sounds that they already had which came by way of the scandinavians a few of these letters and sounds were called thorn and pronounced like the th in thin called eth and pronounced like the th in then also used to represent a vowel sound that was like the a in ate then england was conquered by france in and the english language went undergroundall documents were written in latin or french when it started being used officially again several hundred years later they didnt use any of the old letters or even most of the old words this was the start of middle english however everyone living in niergeard and nearly all the knights who were already sleeping when this was happening didnt know of this change and a lot of them still use the old letters which is why youll find them in these books
