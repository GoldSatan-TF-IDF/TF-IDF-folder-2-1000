sandwiches have been beyond measure i also owe thanks and apologies to sophie james and vivian who saw so little of her during the final weeks of work chapter it can hardly be a coincidence that no language on earth has ever produced the expression as pretty as an airport airports are ugly some are very ugly some attain a degree of ugliness that can only be the result of a special effort this ugliness arises because airports ane full of people who are tired cross and have just discovered that their luggage has landed in murmansk murmansk airport is the only known exception to this otherwise infallible rule and architects have on the whole tried to reflect this in their designs they have sought to highlight the tiredness and crossness motif with brutal shapes and nerve jangling colours to make effortless the business of separating the traveller for ever from his or her luggage or loved ones to confuse the traveller with arrows that appear to point at the windows distant tie racks or the current position of ursa minor in the night sky and wherever possible to expose the plumbing on the grounds that it is functional and conceal the location of the departure gates presumably on the grounds that they are not caught in the middle of a sea of hazy light and a sea of hazy noise kate schechter stood and doubted all the way out of london to heathrow she had suffered from doubt she was not a superstitious person or even a religious person she was simply someone who was not at all sure she should be flying to norway but she was finding it increasingly easy to believe that god if there was a god and if it was remotely possible that any godlike being who could order the disposition of particles at the creation of the universe would also be interested in directing traffic on the m did not want her to fly to norway either all the trouble with the tickets finding a nextdoor neighbour to look after the cat then finding the cat so it could be looked after by the nextdoor neighbour the sudden leak in the roof the missing wallet the weather the unexpected death of the nextdoor neighbour the pregnancy of the cat it all had the semblance of an orchestrated campaign of obstruction which had begun to assume godlike proportions even the taxidriver when she had eventually found a taxi had said norway what you want to go there for and when she hadnt instantly said the aurora borealis or fjords but had looked doubtful for a moment and bitten her lip he had said i know i bet its some bloke dragging you out there tell you what tell him to stuff it go to tenerife there was an idea tenerife or even she dared to think for a fleeting second home she had stared dumbly out of the taxi window at the angry tangles of traffic and thought that however cold and miserable the weather was here that was nothing to what it would be like in norway or indeed at home home would bc about as icebound as norway right now icebound and punctuated with geysers of steam bursting out of the grnund catching in the frigid air and dissipating bctween the glacial cliff faces of sixth avenue a quick glance at the itinerary kate had pursued in the course of her thirty years would reveal her without any doubt to be a new yorker for though she had lived in the city very little most of her life had been spent at a constant distance from it los angeles san francisco europe and a period of distracted wandering around south america five years ago following the loss of her newly mamed husband luke in a new york taxihailing accident she enjoyed the notion that new york was home and that she missed it but in fact the only thing she really missed was pizza and not just any old pizza but the sort of pizza they brought to your door if you phoned them up and asked them to that was the only real pizza pizza that you had to go out and sit at a table staring at red paper napkins for wasnt real pizza however much extra pepperoni and anchovy they put on it london was the place she liked living in most apart of course from the pizza problem which drove her crazy why would no one deliver pizza why did no one understand that it was fundamental to the whole nature of pizza that it amved at your front door in a hot cardboard box that you slithered it out of greaseproof paper and ate it in folded slices in front of the tv what was the fundamental flaw in the stupid stuckup sluggardly english that they couldnt grasp this simple principle for some odd reason it was the one frustration she could never learn simply to live with and accept and about once a month or so she would get very depressed phone a pizza restaurant order the biggest most lavish pizza she could describe pizza with an extra pizza on it essentially and then sweetly ask them to deliver it to what deliver let me give you the address i dont understand arent you going to come and pick it up no arent you going to deliver my address er we dont do that miss dont do what er deliver you dont deliver am i hearing you correctly the exchange would quickly degenerate into an ugly slanging match which would leave her feeling drained and shaky but much much better the following morning in all other respects she was one of the most sweetnatured people you could hope to meet but today was testing her to the limit there had been terrible traffic jams on the motorway and when the distant flash of blue lights made it clear that the cause was an accident somewhere ahead of them kate had become more tense and had stared fixedly out of the other window as eventually they had crawled past it the taxidriver had been badtempered when at last he had dropped her off because she didnt have the right money and there was a lot of disgruntled hunting through tight trouser pockets before he was eventually able to find change for her the atmosphere was heavy and thundery and now standing in the middle of the main checkin concourse at terminal two heathrow airport she could not find the checkin desk for her flight to oslo she stood very still for a moment breathing calmly and deeply and trying not to think of jeanphilippe jeanphilippe was as the taxidriver had correctly guessed the reason why she was going to norway but was also the reason why she was convinced that norway was not at all a good place for her to go thinking of him therefore made her head oscillate and it seemed best not to think about him at all but simply to go to norway as if that was where she happened to be going anyway she would then be terribly surprised to bump into him at whatever hotel it was he had written on the card that was tucked into the side pocket of her handbag in fact she would be surprised to find him there anyway what she would be much more likely to find was a message from him saying that he had been unexpectedly called away to guatemala seoul or tenerife and that he would call her from there jeanphilippe was the most continually absent person she had ever met in this he was the culmination of a series since she had lost luke to the great yellow chevrolet she had been oddly dependent on the rather vacant emotions that a succession of selfabsorbed men had inspired in her she tried to shut all this out of her mind and even shut her eyes for a second she wished that when she opened them again there would be a sign in front of her saying this way for norway which she could simply follow without needing to think about it or anything else ever again this she reflected in a continuation of her earlier train of thought was presumably how religions got started and must be the reason why so many sects hang around airports looking for converts they know that people there are at their most vulnerable and perplexed and ready to accept any kind of guidance kate opened her eyes again and was of course disappointed but then a second or two later there was a momentary parting in a long surging wave of cross germans in inexplicable yellow polo shirts and through it she had a brief glimpse of the checkin desk for oslo lugging her garment bag on to her shoulder she made her way towards it there was just one other person before her in the line at the desk and he it turned out was having trouble or perhaps making it he was a large man impressively large and wellbuilt even expertly built but he was also definitely oddlooking in a way that kate couldnt quite deal with she couldnt even say what it was that was odd about him only that she was immediately inclined not to include him on her list of things to think about at the moment she remembered reading an article which had explained that the central processing unit of the human brain only had seven memory registers which meant that if you had seven things in your mind at the same time and then thought of something else orte of the other seven would instantly drop out in quick succession she thought about whether or not she was likely to catch the plane about whether it was just her imagination that the day was a particularly bloody one about airline staff who smile charmingly and are breathtakingly rude about duty free shops which are able to charge much lower prices than ordinary shops but mysteriously dont about whether or not she felt a magazine article about airports coming on which might help pay for the trip about whether her garment bag would hurt less on her other shoulder and finally in spite of all her intentions to the contrary about jeanphilippe who was another set of at lest seven subtopics all to himself the man standing arguing in front of her popped right out of her mind it was only the announcement on the airport tannoy of the last call for her flight to oslo which forced her attention back to the situation in front of her the large man was making trouble about the fact that he hadnt been given a first class seat reservation it had just transpired that the reason for this was that he didnt in fact have a first class ticket kates spirits sank to the very bottom of her being and began to prowl around there making a low growling noise it now transpired that the man in front of her didnt actually have a ticket at all and the argument then began to range freely and angrily over such topics as the physical appearance of the airlineheckin girl her qualities as a person theories about her ancestors speculations as to what surprises the future might have in store for her and the airline for which she worked and finally lit by chance on the happy subject of the mans credit card he didnt have one further discussions ensued and had to do with cheques and why the airline did not accept them kate took a long slow murderous look at her watch excuse me she said interrupting the transactions is this going to take long i have to catch the oslo flight im just dealing with this gentleman said the girl ill be with you in just one second kate nodded and politely allowed just one second to go by its just that the flights about to leave she said then i have one bag i have my ticket i have a reservation itll take about thirty seconds i hate to interrupt but id hate even more to miss my flight for the sake of thirty seconds thats thirty actual seconds not thirty just one seconds which could keep us here all night the checkin girl turned the full glare on her lipgloss on to kate but before she could speak the large blond man looked round and the effect of his face was a little disconcerting i too he said in a slow angry nordic voice wish to fly to oslo kate stared at him he looked thoroughly out of place in an airport or rather the airport looked thoroughly out of place around him well she said the way were stacked up at the moment it looks like neither of us is going to make it can we just sort this one out whats the holdup the checkin girl smiled her charming dead smile and said the airline does not accept cheques as a matter of company policy well i do said kate slapping down her own credit card charge the gentlemans ticket to this and ill take a cheque from him ok she added to the big man who was looking at her with slow surprise his eyes were large and blue and conveyed the impression that they had looked at a lot of glaciers in their time they were extraordinarily arrogant and also muddled ok she repeated briskly my name is kate schechter two cs two hs two es and also a t an r and an s provided theyre all there the bank wont be fussy about the order they come in they never seem to know themselves the man very slowly inclined his head a little towards her in a rough bow of acknowledgement he thanked her for her kindness courtesy and some norwegian word that was lost on her said that it was a long while since he had encountered anything of the kind that she was a woman of spirit and some other norwegian word and that he was indebted to her he also added as an afterthought that he had no chequebook right said kate determined not to be deflected from her course she fished in her handbag for a piece of paper took a pen from the checkin counter scribbled on the paper and thrust it at him thats my address she said send me the money hock your fur coat if you have to just send it me ok im taking a flyer on trusting you the big man took the scrap of paper read the few words on it with immense slowness then folded it with elaborate care and put it into the pocket of his coat again he bowed to her very slightly kate suddenly realised that the checkin girl was silently waiting for her pen back to fill in the credit card form she pushed it back at her in annoyance handed over her own ticket and imposed on herself an icy calm the airport tannoy announced the departure of their flight may i see your passports please said the girl unhunriedly kate handed hers over but the big man didnt have one you what exclaimed kate the airline girl simply stopped moving at all and stared quietly at a random point on her desk waiting for someone else to make a move it wasnt her problem the man repeated angrily that he didnt have a passport he shouted it and banged his fist on the counter so hard that it was slightly dented by the force of the blow kate picked up her ticket her passport and her credit card and hoisted her garment bag back up on to her shoulder this is when i get off she said and simply walked away she felt that she had made every effort a human being could possibly be expected to make to catch her plane but that it was not to be she would send a message to jeanphilippe saying that she could not be there and it would probably sit in a slot next to his message to her saying why he could not be there either for once they would be equally absent for the time being she would go and cool off she set off in search of first a newspaper and then some coffee and by dint of following the appropriate signs was unable to locate either she was then unable to find a working phone from which to send a message and decided to give up on the airport altogether just get out she told herself find a taxi and go back home she threaded her way back across the checkin concourse and had almost made it to the exit when she happened to glance back at the checkin desk that had defeated her and was just in time to see it shoot up through the roof engulfed in a ball of orange flame as she lay beneath a pile of rubble in pain darkness and choking dust trying to find sensation in her limbs she was at least relieved to be able to think that she hadnt merely been imagining that this was a bad day so thinking she passed out chapter the usual people tried to claim responsibility first the ira then the plo and the gas board even british nuclear fuels rushed out a statement to the effect that the situation was completely under control that it was a one in a million chance that there was hardly any radioactive leakage at all and that the site of the explosion would make a nice location for a day out with the kids and a picnic before finally having to admit that it wasnt actually anything to do with them at all no cause could be found for the explosion it seemed to have happened spontaneously and of its own free will explanations were advanced but most of these were simply phrases which restated the problem in different words along the same principles which had given the world metal fatigue in fact a very similar phrase was invented to account for the sudden transition of wood metal plastic and concrete into an explosive condition which was nonlinear catastrophic swctural exasperation or to put it another way as a junior cabinet minister did on television the following night in a phrase which was to haunt the rest of his career the checkin desk had just got fundamentally fed up with being where it was as in all such disastrous events estimates of the casualties varied wildly they started at fortyseven dead eightynine seriously injured went up to sixtythree dead a hundred and thirty injured and rose as high as one hundred and seventeen dead before the figures started to be revised downwards once more the final figures revealed that once all the people who could be accounted for had been accounted for in fact no one had been killed at all a small number of people were in hospital suffering from cuts and bruises and varying degrees of traumatised shock but that unless anyone had any information about anybody actually being missing was that this was yet another inexplicable aspect to the whole affair the force of the explosion had been enough to reduce a large part of the front of terminal two to rubble and yet everyone inside the building had somehow either fallen very luckily or been shielded from one piece of falling masonry by another or had the shock of the explosion absorbed by their luggage all in all very little luggage had survived at all there were questions asked in parliament about this but not very interesting ones it was a couple of days before kate schechter became aware of any of these things or indeed of anything at all in the outside world she passed the time quietly in a world of her own in which she was surrounded as far as the eye could see with old cabin trunks full of past memories in which she rummaged with great curiosity and sometimes bewilderment or at least about a tenth of the cabin trunks were full of vivid and often painful or uncomfortable memories of her past life the other ninetenths were full of penguins which surprised her insofar as she recognised at all that she was dreaming she realised that she must be exploring her own subconscious mind she had heard it said that humans are supposed only to use about a tenth of their brains and that no one was very clear what the other ninetenths were for but she had certainly never heard it suggested that they were used for storing penguins gradually the trunks the memories and the penguins began to grow indistinct to become all white and swimmy then to become like walls that were all white and swimmy and finally to become walls that were merely white or rather a yellowish greenish kind of offwhite and to enclose her in a small room the room was in semidarkness a bedside light was on but turned down low and the light from a street lamp found its way between the grey curtains and threw sodium patterns on the opposite wall she became dimly aware of the shadowed shape of her own body lying under the white turneddown sheet and the pale neat blankets she stared at it for a nervous while checking that it looked right before she tried tentatively to move any part of it she tried her right hand and that seemed to be fine a little stiff and aching but the fingers all responded and all seemed to be of the right length and thickness and to bend in the right places and in the right directions she panicked briefly when she couldnt immediately locate her left hand but then she found it lying across her stomach and nagging at her in some odd way it took her a second or two of concentration to put together a number of rather disturbing feelings and realise that there was a needle bandaged into her arm this shook her quite badly from the needle there snaked a long thin transparent pipe that glistened yellowly in the light from the street lamp and hung in a gentle curl from a thick plastic bag suspended from a tall metal stand an array of horrors briefly assailed her in respect of this apparatus but she peered dimly at the bag and saw the words dextrosaline she made herself calm down again and lay quietly for a few moments before continuing her exploration her ribcage seemed undamaged bruised and tender but there was no shaiper pain anywhere to suggest that anything was broken her hips and thighs ached and were stiff but revealed no serious hurt she flexed the muscles down her right leg and then her left she rather fancied that her left ankle was sprained in other words she told herself she was perfectly all right so what was she doing here in what she could tell from the septic colour of the paint was clearly a hospital she sat up impatiently and immediately rejoined the penguins for an entertaining few minutes the next time she came round she treated herself with a little more care and lay quietly feeling gently nauseous she poked gingerly at her memory of what had happened it was dark and blotchy and came at her in sick greasy waves like the north sea lumpy things jumbled themselves out of it and slowly arranged themselves into a heaving airport the airport was sour and ached in her head and in the middle of it pulsing like a migraine was the memory of a moments whirling splurge of light it became suddenly very clear to her that the checkin concourse of terminal two at heathrow airport had been hit by a meteorite silhouetted in the flare was the furcoated figure of a big man who must have caught the full force of it and been reduced instantly to a cloud of atoms that were free to go as they pleased the thought caused a deep and horrid shudder to go through her he had been infuriating and arrogant but she had liked him in an odd way there had been something oddly noble in his perverse bloodymindedness or maybe she realised she liked to think that such perverse bloodymindedness was noble because it reminded her of herself trying to order pizza to be delivered in an alien hostile and nonpizzadelivering world nobleness was one word for making a fuss about the trivial inevitabilities of life but there were others she felt a sudden surge of fear and loneliness but it quickly ebbed away and left her feeling much more composed relaxed and wanting to go to the lavatory according to her watch it was shortly after three oclock and according to everything else it was nighttime she should probably call a nurse and let the world know she had come round there was a window in the side wall of the room through which she could see a dim corridor in which stood a stretcher trolley and a tall black oxygen bottle but which was otherwise empty things were very quiet out there peering around her in the small room she saw a whitepainted plywood cupboard a couple of tubular steel and vinyl chairs lurking quietly in the shadows and a whitepainted plywood bedside cabinet which supported a small bowl with a single banana in it on the other side of the bed stood her drip stand set into the wall on that side of the bed was a metal plate with a couple of black knobs and a set of old bakelite headphones hanging from it and wound around the tubular side pillar of the bedhead was a cable with a bell push attached to it which she fingered and then decided not to push she was fine she could find her own way about slowly a little woozily she pushed herself up on to her elbows and slid her legs out from under the sheets and on to the floor which was cold to her feet she could tell almost immediately that she shouldnt be doing this because every part of her feet was sending back streams of messages telling her exactly what every tiniest bit of the floor that they touched felt like as if it was a strange and worrying thing the like of which they had never encountered before nevertheless she sat on the edge of the bed and made her feet accept the floor as something they were just going to have to get used to ttte hospital had put her into a large baggy striped thing it wasnt merely baggy she decided on examining it more closely it actually was a bag a bag of loose blue and white striped cotton it opened up the back and let in chilly night draughts perfunctory sleeves flopped halfway down her arms she moved her arms around in the light examining the skin rubbing it and pinching it especially around the bandage which held her drip needle in place normally her arms were lithe and the skin was firm and supple tonight however they looked like bits of chickens briefly she smoothed each forearm with her other hand and then looked up again purposefully she reached out and gripped the drip stand and because it wobbled slightly less than she did she was able to use it to pull herself slowly to her feet she stood there her tall slim figure trembling and after a few seconds she held the drip stand away at a bent arms length like a shepherd holding a crook she had not made it to norway but she was at least standing up the drip stand rolled on four small and independently perverse wheels which behaved like four screaming children in a supermarket but nevertheless kate was able to propel it to the door ahead of her walking increased her sense of wooziness but also increased her resolve not to give in to it she reached the door opened it and pushing the drip stand out ahead of her looked out into the corridor to her left the corridor ended in a couple of swingdoors with circular porthole windows which seemed to lead into a larger area an open ward perhaps to her right a number of smaller doors opened off the corridor as it continued on for a short distance before turning a sharp corner one of those doors would probably be the lavatory the others well she would find out as she looked for the lavatory the first two were cupboards the third was slightly bigger and had a chair in it and therefor probably counted as a room since most people dont like to sit in cupboards even nurses who have to do a lot of things that most people wouldnt like to it also had a stack of styro beakers a lot of semicongealed coffee creamer and an elderly coffee maker all sitting on top of a small table together and seeping grimly over a copy of the evening standard kate picked up the dark damp paper and tried to reconstruct some of her missing days from it however what with her own wobbly condition making it difficult to read and the droopily stucktogether condition of the newspaper she was able to glean little more than the fact that no one could really say for certain what had happened it seemed that no one had been seriously hurt but that an employee of one of the airlines was still unaccounted for the incident had now been officially classified as an act of god nice one god thought kate she put down the remains of the paper and closed the door behind her the next door she tried was another small side ward like her own there was a bedside table and a single banana in the fruit bowl the bed was clearly occupied she pulled the door to quickly but she did not pull it quickly enough unfortunately something odd had caught her attention but although she had noticed it she coutd not immediately say what it was she stood there with the door half closed staring at the door knowing that she should not look again and knowing that she would carefully she eased the door back open again the room was darkly shadowed and chilly the chilliness did not give her a good feeling about the occupant of the bed she listened the silence didnt sound too good either it wasnt the silence of healthy deep sleep it was the silence of nothing but a little distant traffic noise she hesitated for a long while silhouetted in the doorway looking and listening she wondered about the sheer bulk of the occupant of the bed and how cold he was with just a thin blanket pulled over him next to the bed was a small tubularlegged vinyl bucket chair which was rather overwhelmed by the huge nnd heavy fur coat draped over it and kate thought that the coat should more properly be draped over the bed and its cold occupant at last walking as softly and cautiously as she could she moved into the room and over to the bed she stood looking down at the face of the big nordic man though cold and though his eyes were shut his face was frowning slightly as if he was still rather worried about something this struck kate as being almost infinitely sad in life the man had had the air of someone who was beset by huge if somewhat puzzling difficulties and the appearance that he had almost immediately found things beyond this life that were a bother to him as well was miserable to contemplate she was astonished that he appeared to be so unscathed his skin was totally unmarked it was rugged and healthy or rather had been healthy until very recently closer inspection showed a network of fine lines which suggested that he was older than the midthirties she had originally assumed he could even have been a very fit and healthy man in his late forties standing against the wall by the door was something unexpected it was a large cocacola vending machine it didnt look as if it had been installed there it wasnt plugged in and it had a small neat sticker on it explaining that it was temporarily out of order it looked as if it had simply been left there inadvenently by someone who was probably even now walking around wondering which room he had left it in its large red and white wavy panel stared glassily into the room and did not explain itself the only thing the machine communicated to the outside world was that there was a slot into which coins of a variety of denominations might be inserted and an aperture to which a variety of different cans would be delivered if the machine was working which it was not there was also an old sledgehammer leaning against it which was in its own way odd faintness began to creep over kate the room began to develop a slight spin and there was some restless rustling in the cabin trunks of her mind then she realised that the rustling wasnt simply her imagination there was a distinct noise in the room a heavy beating scratching noise a muffled fluttering the noise rose and fell like the wind but in her dazed and woozy state kate could not at first tell where the noise was coming from at last her gaze fell on the curtains she stared at them with the worried frown of a drunk trying to work out why the door is dancing the sound was coming from the curtains she walked uncertainly towards them and pulled them apart a huge eagle with circles tattooed on its wings was clattering and beating against the window staring in with great yellow eyes and pecking wildly at the glass kate staggered back turned and tried to heave herself out of the room at the end of the corridor the porthole doors swung open and two figures came through them hands rushed towards her as she became hopelessly entangled in the drip stand and began slowly to spin towards the floor she was unconscious as they carefully laid her back in her bed she was unconscious half an hour later when a disturbingly short figure in a worryingly long white doctors coat arrived wheeled the big man away on a stretcher trolley and then returned after a few minutes for the cocacola machine she woke a few hours later with a wintry sun seeping through the window the day looked very quiet and ordinary but kate was still shaking chapter the same sun later broke in through the upper windows of a house in north london and struck the peacefully sleeping figure of a man the room in which he slept was large and bedraggled and did not much benefit from the sudden intrusion of light the sun crept slowly across the bedclothes as if nervous of what it might find amongst them slunk down the side of the bed moved in a rather startled way across some objects it encountered on the floor toyed nervously with a couple of motes of dust lit briefly on a stuffed fruitbat hanging in the corner and fled this was about as big an appearance as the sun ever put in here and it lasted for about an hour or so during which time the sleeping figure scarcely stirred at eleven oclock the phone rang and still the figure did not respond any more than it had responded when the phone had rung at twentyfive to seven in the morning again at twenty to seven again at ten to seven and again for ten minutes continuously starting at five to seven after which it has settled into a long and significant silence disturbed only by the braying of police sirens in a nearby street at around nine oclock the delivery of a large eighteenthcentury dual manual harpsichord at around ninefifteen and the collection of same by bailiffs at a little after ten this was a not uncommon sort of occurrence the people concerned were accustomed to finding the key under the doormat and the man in the bed was accustomed to sleeping through it you would probably not say that he was sleeping the sleep of the just unless you meant the just asleep but it was certainly the sleep of someone who was not fooling about when he climbed into bed of a night and turned off the light the room was not a room to elevate the soul louis xiv to pick a name at random would not have liked it would have found it not sunny enough and insufficiently full of mirrors he would have desired someone to pick up the socks put the records away and maybe burn the place down michelangelo would have been distressed by its proponions which were neither lofty nor shaped by any noticeable inner harmony or symmetry other than that all parts of the room were pretty much equally full of old coffee mugs shoes and brimming ashtrays most of which were now sharing their tasks with each other the walls were painted in almost precisely that shade of green which raffaello sanzio would have bitten off his own right hand at the wrist rather than use and hercules on seeing the room would probably have returned half an hour later armed with a navigable river it was in short a dump and was likely to remain so for as long as it remained in the custody of mr svlad or dirk gently n cjelli at last gently stirred the sheets and blankets were pulled up tightly around his head but from somewhere half way down the length of the bed a hand slowly emerged from under the bedclothes and its fingers felt their way in little tapping movements along the floor working from experience they neatly circumvented a bowl of sornething very nasty that had been sitting there since michaelmas and eventually happened upon a halfempty pack of untipped gauloises and a box of matches the fingers shook a crumpled white tube free of the pack seized it and the box of matches and then started to poke a way through the sheets tangled together at the top of the bed like a magician prodding at a handkerchief from which he intends to release a flock of doves the cigarette was at last inserted into the hole the cigarette was lit for a while the bed itself appeared to be smoking the cigarette in great heaving drags it coughed long loud and shudderingly and then began at last to breathe in a more measured rhythm in this way dirk gently achieved consciousness he lay there for a while feeling a terrible sense of worry and guilt about something weighing on his shoulders he wished he could forget about it and promptly did he levered himself out of bed and a few minutes later padded downstairs the mail on the doormat consisted of the usual things a rude letter threatening to take away his american express card an invitation to apply for an american express card and a few bills of the more hysterical and unrealistic type he couldnt understand why they kept sending them the cost of the postage seemed merely to be good money thrown after bad he shook his head in wonderment at the malevolent incompetence of the world threw the mail away entered the kitchen and approached the fridge with caution it stood in the corner the kitchen was large and shrouded in a deep gloom that was not relieved only turned yellow by the action of switching on the light dirk squatted down in front of the fridge and carefully examined the edge of the door he found what he was looking for in fact he found more than he was looking for near the bottom of the door across the narrow gap which separated the door from the main body of the fridge which held the strip of grey insulating rubber lay a single human hair it was stuck there with dried saliva that he had expected he had stuck it there himself three days earlier and had checked it on several occasions since then what he had not expected to fine was a second hair he frowned at it in alarm a second hair it was stuck across the gap in the same way as the first one only this hair was near the top of the fridge door and he had not put it there he peered at it closely and even went so far as to go and open the old shutters on the kitchen windows to let some extra light in upon the scene the daylight shouldered its way in like a squad of poiicemen and did a lot of whatsallthising around the room which like the bedroom would have presented anyone of an aesthetic disposition with difficulties like most of the rooms in dirks house it was large looming and utterly dishevelled it simply sneered at anyones attempts to tidy it sneered at them and brushed them aside like one of the small pile of dead and disheartened flies that lay beneath the window on top of a pile of old pizza boxes the light revealed the second hair for what it was a grey hair at root dyed a vivid metallic orange dirk pursed his lips and thought very deeply he didnt need to think hard in order to realise who the hair belonged to there was only one person who regularly entered the kitchen looking as if her head had been used for extracting metal oxides from industrial waste but he did have seriously to consider the implications of the discovery that she had been plastering her hair across the door of his fridge it meant that the silently waged conflict between himself and his cleaning lady had escalated to a new and more frightening level it was now dirk reckoned fully three months since this fridge door had been opened and each of them was grimly determined not to be the one to open it first the fridge no longer merely stood there in the comer of the kitchen it actually lurked dirk could quite clearly remember the day on which the thing had started lurking it was about a week ago when dirk had tried a simple subterfuge to trick elena the old bats name was elena pronounced to rhyme with cleaner which was an irony that dirk now no longer relished into opening the fridge door the subterfuge had been deftly deflected and had nearly rebounded horribly on dirk he had resorted to the strategy of going to the local minimarket to buy a few simple groceries nothing contentious a little milk some eggs some bacon a carton or two of chocolate custard and a simple halfpound of butter he had left them innocently on top of the fridge as if to say oh when you have a moment perhaps you could pop these inside when he had returned that evening his heart bounded to see that they were no longer on top of the fridge they were gone they had not been merely moved aside or put on a shelf they were nowhere to be seen she must finally have capitulated and put them away in the fridge and she would surely have cleaned it out once it was actually open for the first and only time his heart swelled with warmth and gratitude towards her and he was about to fling open the door of the thing in relief and triumph when an eighth sense at the last count dirk reckoned he had eleven warned him to be very very careful and to consider first where elena might have put the cleared out contents of the fridge a nameless doubt gnawed at his mind as he moved noiselessly towards the garbage bin beneath the sink holding his breath he opened the lid and looked there nestling in the folds of the fresh black bin liner were his eggs his bacon his chocolate custard and his simple halfpound of butter two milk bottles stood rinsed and neatly lined up by the sink into which their contents had presumably been poured she had thrown it away rather than open the fridge door she had thrown his food away he looked round slowly at the grimy squat white monolith and that was the exact moment at which he realised without a shadow of a doubt that his fridge had now begun seriously to lurk he made himself a stiff black coffee and sat slightly trembling he had not even looked directly at the sink but he knew that he must unconsciously have noticed the two clean milk bottles there and some busy part of his mind had been alarmed by them the next day he had explained all this away to himself he was becoming needlessly paranoiac it had surely been an innocent or careless mistake on elenas part she had probably been brooding distractedly on her sons attack of bronchitis peevishness or homosexuality or whatever it was that regularly prevented her from either turning up or from having noticeable effect when she did she was italian and probably had absentmindedly mistaken his food for garbage but the business with the hair changed all that it established beyond all possible doubt that she knew exactly what she was doing she was under no circumstamces going to open the fridge door until he had opened it first and he was under no circumstances going to open the fridge until she had obviously she had not noticed his hair otherwise it would have been her most effective course simply to pull it off thus tricking him into thinking she had opened the fridge he shuuld presumably now remove her hair in the hope of pulling that same trick on her but even as he sat there he knew that somehow that wouldnt work and that they were locked into a tightening spiral of nonfridgeopening that would lead them both to madness or perdition he wondered if he could hire someone to come and open the fridge no he was not in a position to hire anybody to do anything he was not even in a position to pay elena for the last three weeks the only reason he didnt ask her to leave was that sacking somebody inevitably involved paying them off and this he was in no position to do his secretary had finally left him on her own initiative and gone off to do something reprehensible in the travel business dirk had attempted to cast scon on her preferring monotony of pay over regularity of pay she had calmly corrected him over job satisfaction she had nearly said over what but at that moment she realised that if she said that she would have to listen to his reply which would be bound to infuriate her into arguing back it occurred to her for the first time that the only way of escaping was just not to get drawn into these arguments if she simply did not respond this time then she was free to leave she tried it she felt a sudden freedom she left a week later in much the same mood she married an airline cabin steward called smith dirk had kicked her desk over and then had to pick it up himself later when she didnt come back the detective business was currently as brisk as the tomb nobody it seemed wished to have anything detected he had recently to make ends meet taken up doing palmistry in drag on thursday evenings but he wasnt comfortable with it he could have withstood it the hateful abject humiliation of it all was something to which he had in different ways now become accustomed and he was quite anonymous in his little tent in the back garden of the pub he could have withstood it all if he hadnt been so horribly excruciatingly good at it it made him break out in a sweat of self loathing he tried by every means to cheat to fake to be deliberately and cynically bad but whatever fakery he tried to introduce always failed and he invariably ended up being right his worst moment had come about as a result of the poor woman from oxfordshiie who had come in to see him one evening being in something of a waggish mood he had suggested that she should keep an eye on her husband who judging by her mamage line looked to be a bit of a flighty type it transpired that her husband was in fact a fighter pilot and that his plane had been lost in an exerrise over the north sea only a fortnight earlier dirk had been flustered by this and had soothed meaninglessly at her he was certain he said that her husband would be restored to her in the fullness of time that all would be well and that all manner of things would be well and so on the woman said that she thought this was not very likely seeing as the world record for staying alive in the north sea was rather less than an hour and since no trace of her husband had been found in two weeks it seemed fanciful to imagine that he was anything other than stone dead and she was trying to get used to the idea thank you very much she said it rather tartly dirk had lost all control at this point and started to babble he said that it was very clear from reading her hands that the great sum of money she had coming to her would be no consolation to her for the loss of her dear dear husband but that at least it might comfort her to know that he had gone on to that great something or other in the sky that he was floating on the fleeciest of white clouds looking very handsome in his new set of wings and that he was terribly sorry to be talking such appalling drivel but she had caught him rather by surprise would she care for some tea or some vodka or some soup the woman demurred she said she had only wandered into the tent by accident she had been looking for the lavatories and what was that about the money complete gibberish dirk had explained he was in great difficulties what with having the falsetto to keep up i was making it up as i went along he said please allow me to tender my most profound apologies for intruding so clumsily on your private grief and to escort you to er or rather direct you to the well what i can only in the circumstances call the lavatory which is out of the tent and on the left dirk had been cast down by this encounter but was then utterly horrified a few days later when he discovered that the very following morning the unfonunate woman had learnt that she had won on the premium bonds he spent several hours that night standing on the roof of his house shaking his fist at the dark sky and shouting stop it until a neighbour complained to the police that he couldnt sleep the police had come round in a screaming squad car and woken up the rest of the neighbourhood as well today this morning dirk sat in his kitchen and stared dejectedly at his fridge the bloodyminded ebullience which he usually relied on to carry him through the day had been knocked out of him in its very opening moments by the business with the fridge his will sat imprisoned in it locked up by a single hair what he needed he thought was a client please god he thought if there is a god any god bring me a client just a simple client the simpler the better credulous and rich someone like that chap yesterday he tapped his fingers on the table the problem was that the more credulous the client the more dirk fell foul at the end of his own better nature which was constantly rearing up and embarrassing him at the most inopportune moments dirk frequently threatened to hurl his better nature to the ground and kneel on its windpipe but it usually managed to get the better of him by dressing itself up as guilt and self loathing in which guise it could throw him right out of the ring credulous and rich just so that he could pay off some perhaps even just one of the more prominent and sensational bills he lit a cigarette the smoke curled upwards in the moming light and attached itself to the ceiling like that chap yesterday he paused the chap yesterday the world held its breath quietly and gently there settled on him the knowledge that something somewhere was ghastly something was terribly wrong there was a disaster hanging silently in the air around him waiting for him to notice it his knees tingled what he needed he had been thinking was a client he had been thinking that as a matter of habit it was what he always thought at this time of the morning what he had forgotten was that he had one he stared wildly at his watch nearly eleventhirty he shook his head to try and clear the silent ringing between his ears then made a hysterical lunge for his hat and his great leather coat that hung behind the door fifteen seconds later he left the house five hours late but moving fast chapter a minute or two later dirk paused to consider his best strategy rather than arrive five hours late and flustered it would be better all round if he were to arrive five hours and a few extra minutes late but triumphantly in command pray god i am not too soon would be a good opening line as he swept in but it needed a good followthrough as well and he wasnt sure what it should be perhaps it would save time if he went back to get his car but then again it was only a short distance and he had a tremendous propensity for getting lost when driving this was largely because of his method of zen navigation which was simply to find any car that looked as if it knew where it was going and follow it the results were more often surprising than successful but he felt it was worth it for the sake of the few occasions when it was both furthermore he was not at all certain that his car was working it was an elderly jaguar built at that very special time in the companys history when they were making cars which had to stop for repairs more often than they needed to stop for petrol and frequently needed to rest for months between outings he was however certain now that he came to think about it that the car didnt have any petrol and furthermore he did not have any cash or valid plastic to enable him to fill it up he abandoned that line of thought as wholly fruitless he stopped to buy a newspaper while he thought things over the clock in the newsagents said eleven thirtyfive damn damn damn he toyed with the idea of simply dropping the case just walking away and forgetting about it having some lunch the whole thing was fraught with difficulties in any event or rather it was fraught with one particular difficulty which was that of keeping a straight face the whole thing was complete and utter nonsense the client was clearly loopy and dirk would not have considered taking the case except for one very important thing three hundred pounds a day plus expenses the client had agreed to it just like that and when dirk had started his usual speech to the effect that his methods involving as they did the fundamental interconnectedness of all things often led to expenses that might appear to the untutored eye to be somewhat tangential to the matter in hand the client had simply waved the matter aside as trifling dirk liked that in a client the only thing the client had insisted upon in the midst of this almost superhuman fit of reasonableness was that dirk had to be there absolutely had had had to be there ready functioning and alert without fail without even the merest smidgen of an inkling of failure at sixthirty in the morning absolute well he was just going to have to see reason about that as well sixthirty was clearly a preposterous time and he the client obviously hadnt meant it seriously a civilised sixthirty for twelve noon was almost certainly what he had in mind and if he wanted to cut up rough about it dirk would have no option but to start handing out some serious statistics nobody got murdered before lunch but nobody people werent up to it you needed a good lunch to get both the bloodsugar and bloodlust levels up dirk had the figures to prove it did he anstey the clients name was anstey an odd intense man in his midthirties with staring eyes a narrow yellow tie and one of the big houses in lupton road dirk hadnt actually liked him very much and thought he looked as if he was trying to swallow a fish did he know that per cent of all known murderers who expressed a preference had had liver and bacon for lunch and that another per cent had been torn between either a prawn biryani or an omelette that dispensed with per cent of the threat at a stroke and by the time you had further discounted the salad eaters and the turkey and ham sandwich munchers and started to look at the number of people who would contemplate such a course of action without any lunch at all then you were well into the realms of negligibility and bordering on fantasy after twothirty but nearer to three oclock was when you had to start being on your guard seriously even on good days even when you werent receiving death threats from strange gigantic men with green eyes you had to watch people like a hawk after the lunching hour the really dangerous time was after four oclockish when the streets began to fill up with marauding packs of publishers and agents maddened with fettucine and kir and baying for cabs those were the times that tested mens souls sixthirty in the morning forget it dirk had with his resolve well stiffened dirk stepped back out of the newsagents into the nippy air of the street and strode off ah i expect youll be wanting to pay for that paper then wont you mr dirk sir said the newsagent trotting gently after him ah bates said dirk loftily you and your expectations always expecting this and expecting that may i recommend serenity to you a life that is burdened with expectations is a heavy life its fruit is sorrow and disappointment learn to be one with the joy of the moment i thirtk its twenty pence that one sir said bates tranquilly tell you what ill do bates seeing as its you do you have a pen on you at all a simple ballpoint will suffice bates produced one from an inner pocket and handed it to dirk who then tore off the corner of the paper on which the price was printed and scribbled iou above it he handed the scrap of paper to the newsagent shall i put this with the others then sir put it wherever it will give you the greatest joy dear bates i would want you to put it nowhere less for now dear man farewell i expect youll be wanting to give me back my pen as well mr dirk when the times are propitious for such a transaction my dear bates said dirk you may depend upon it for the moment higher purposes call it joy bates great joy bates please let go of it after one last listless tug the little man shrugged and padded back towards his shop i expect ill be seeing you later then mr dirk he called out over his shoulder without enthusiasm dirk gave a gracious bow of his head to the mans retreating back and then hurried on opening the newspaper at the horoscope page as he did so virtually evervthing you decide today will be wrong it said bluntly dirk slapped the paper shut with a grunt he did not for a second hold with the notion that great whirling lumps of rock light years away knew something about your day that you didnt it just so happened that the great zaganza was an old friend of his who knew when dirks birthday was and always wrote his column deliberately to wind him up the papers circulation had dropped by nearly a twelfth since he had taken over doing the horoscope and only dirk and the great zaganza knew why he hurried on flapping his way quickly through the rest of the paper as usual there was nothing interesting a lot of stuff about the search for janice smith the missing airline girl from heathrow and how she could possibly have disappeared just like that they printed the latest picture of her which was on a swing with pigtails aged six her father a mr jim pearce was quoted as saying it was quite a good likeness but she had grown up a lot now and was usually in better focus impatiently dirk tucked the paper under his arm and strode onwards his thoughts on a much more interesting topic three hundred pounds a day plus expenses he wondered how long he could reasonably expect to sustain in mr anstey his strange delusions that he was about to be murdered by a seven foot tall shaggyhaired creature with huge green eyes and horns who habitually waved things at him a contract written in some incomprehensible language and signed with a splash of blood and also a kind of scythe the other notable feature of this creature was that no one other than his client had been able to see it which mr anstey dismissed as a trick of the light three days four dirk didnt think hed be able to manage a whole week with a straight face but he was already looking at something like a grand for his trouble and he would stick a new fridge down on the list of tangential but nonnegotiable expenses that would be a good one getting the old fridge thrown out was definitely part of the interconnectedness of all things he began to whistle at the thought of simply getting someone to come round and cart the thing away turned into lupton road and was surprised at all the police cars there and the ambulance he didnt like them being there it didnt feel right it didnt sit comfortably in his mind alongside his visions of a new fridge chapter dirk knew lupton road it was a wide treelined affair with large latevictorian terraces which stood tall and sturdily and resented police cars resented them if they tumed up in numbers that is and if their lights were flashing the inhabitants of lupton road liked to see a nice wellturnedout single police car patrolling up and down the street in a cheerful and robust manner it kept property values cheerful and robust too but the moment the lights started flashing in that knucklewhitening blue they cast their pallor not only on the neatly pointed bricks that they flashed across but also on the very values those bricks represented anxious faces peered from behind the glass of neighbouring windows and were irradiated by the blue strobes there were three of them three police cars left askew across the road in a way that transcended mere parking it sent out a massive signal to the world saying that the law was here now taking charge of things and that anyone who just had normal good and cheerful business to conduct in lupton road could just fuck off dirk hurried up the road sweat pricking at him beneath his heavy leather coat a police constable loomed up ahead of him with his arms spread out playing at being a stop barrier but dirk swept him aside in a torrent of words to which the constable was unable to come up with a good response off the top of his head dirk sped on to the house at the door another policeman stopped him and dirk was about to wave an expired marks and spencer charge card at him with a deft little flick of the wrist that he had practised for hours in front of a mirror on those long evenings when nothing much else was on when the officer suddenly said hey is your name gently dirk blinked at him warily he made a slight grunting noise that could be either yes or no depending on the circumstances because the chief has been looking for you has he said dirk i recognised you from his description said the officer looking him up and down with a slight smirk in fact continued the officer hes been using your name in a manner that some might find highly offensive he even sent big bob the finder off in a car to find you i can tell that he didnt find you from the fact that youre looking reasonably well lot of people get found by big bob the finder they come in a bit wobbly just about able to help us with our enquiries but thats about all youd better go in rather you than me he added quietly dirk glanced at the house the strippedpine shutters were closed across all the windows though in all other respects the house seemed well cared for groomed into a state of clean wellpointed aftluence the closed shutters seemed to convey an air of sudden devastation oddly there seemed to be music coming from the basement or rather just a single disjointed phrase of thumping music being repeated over and over again it sounded as if the stylus had got stuck in the groove of a record and dirk wondered why no one had turned it off or at least nudged the stylus along so that the record could continue the song seemed very vaguely familiar and dirk guessed that he had probably heard it on the radio recently though he couldnt place it the fragment of lyric seemed to be something like dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pick it up pick it up pick i and so on youll be wanting to go down to the basement said the officer impassively as if that was the last thing that anyone in their right mind would be wanting to do dirk nodded to him curtly and hurried up the steps to the front door which was standing slightly ajar he shook his head and clenched his shoulders to try and stop his brain fluttering he went in the hallway spoke of prosperity imposed on a taste that had originally been formed by student living the floors were stripped boards heavily polyurethaned the walls white with greek rugs hung on them but expensive greek rugs dirk would be prepared to bet that a thorough search of the house would reveal amongst who knew what other dark secrets five hundred british telecom shares and a set of dylan albums that was complete up to blood on the tracks another policeman was standing in the hall he looked terribly young and he was leaning very slightly back against the wall staring at the floor and holding his helmet against his stomach his face was pale and shiny he looked at dirk blankly and nodded faintly in the direction of the stairs leading down up the stairs came the repeated sound dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pick it up pick it up pick i dirk was trembling with a rage that was barging around inside him loooking for something to hit or throttle he wished that he could hotly deny that any of this was his fault but until anybody tried to assert that it was he couldnt how long have you been here he said curtly the young policeman had to gather himself together to answer we arrived about halfhour ago he replied in a thick voice hell of a morning rushing around dont tell me about rushing around said dirk completely meaninglessly he launched himself down the stars dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pick it up pick it up pick i at the bottom there was a narrow corridor the main door off it was heavily cracked and hanging off its hinges it opened into a large double room dirk was about to enter when a figure emerged from it and stood barring his way i hate the fact that this case has got you mixed up in it said the figure i hate it very much tell me what youve got to do with it so i know exactly what it is im hating dirk stared at the neat thin face in astonishment gilks he said dont stand there looking like a startled whatsisname what are those things what arent seals much worse than seals big blubbery things dugongs dont stand there looking like a startled dugong why has that gilks pointed into the room behind him why has thatman in there got your name and teiephone number on an envelope full uf money how m started dirk how may i ask do you come to be here gilks what are you doing so far from the fens surprised you find it dank enough for you here three hundred pounds said gilks why perhaps you would allow me to speak to my client said dirk your client eh said gilks grimly yes all right why dont you speak to him id be interested to hear what you have to say he stood back stiffly and waved dirk into the room dirk gathered his thoughts and entered the room in a state of controlled composure which lasted for just over a second most of his client was sitting quietly in a comfortable chair in front of the hifi the chair was placed in the optimal listening position about twice as far back from the speakers as the distance between them which is generally considered to be ideal for stereo imaging he seemed generally to be casual and relaxed with his legs crossed and a halffinished cup of coffee on the small table beside him distressingly though his head was sitting neatly on the middle of the record which was revolving on the hifi turntable with the tone arm snuggling up against the neck and constantly being deflected back into the same groove as the head revolved it seemed once every seconds or so to shoot dirk a reproachful glance as if to say see what happens when you dont turn up on time like i asked you to then it would sweep on round to the wall round round and back to the front again with more reproach dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pick it up pick it up pick i the room swayed a little around dirk and he put his hand out against the wall to steady it was there any particular service you were engaged to provide for your client said gilks behind him very quietly oh er just a small matter said dirk weakly nothing connected with all this no he er didnt mention any of this kind of thing at all well look i can see youre busy i think id better just collect my fee and leave you say he left it out for me having said this dirk sat heavily on a small bentwood chair standing behind him and broke it gilks hauled him back to his feet again and propped him against the wall briefly he left the room then came back with a small jug of water and a glass on a tray he poured some water into the glass took it to dirk and threw it at him better no spluttered dirk cant you at least turn the record off thats forensics job cant touch anything till the clever dicks have been maybe thats them now go out on to the patio and get some air chain yourself to the railing and beat yourself up a little im pushed for time myself and try to look less green will you its not your colour dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pick it up pick it up pick i gilks turned round looking tired and cross and was about to go out and up the stairs to meet the newcomers whose voices could be heard up on the ground floor when he paused and watched the head revolving patiently on its heavy platter for a few seconds you know he said at last these smartalec showoff suicides really make me tired they only do it to annoy suicide said dirk gilks glanced round at him windows secured with iron bars half an inch thick he said door locked from the inside with the key still in the lock furniture piled against the inside of the door french windows to the patio locked with mortice door bolts no signs of a tunnel if it was murder then the murderer must have stopped to do a damn fine job of glazing on the way out except that all the puttys old nnd painted over no nobodys left this room and nobodys broken into it except for us and im pretty sure we didnt do it i havent time to fiddle around on this one obviously suicide and just done to be difficult ive half a mind to do the deceased for wasting police time tell you what he said glancing at his watch youve got ten minutes if you come up with a plausible explanation of how he did it that i can put in my report ill let you keep the evidence in the envelope minus per cent compensation to me for the emotional wear and tear involved in not punching you in the mouth dirk wondered for a moment whether or not to mention the visits his client claimed to have received from a strange and violent greeneyed furclad giant who regularly emerged out of nowhere bellowing about contracts and obligations and waving a three foot glitteringedged scythe but decided on balance no dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pick it up pick it up pick i he was seething at himself at last he had not been able to seethe at himself properly over the death of his client because it was too huge and horrific a burden to bear but now he had been humiliated by gilks and found himself in too wobbly and disturbed a state to fight back so he was able to seethe at himself about that he turned sharply away from his tormentor and let himself out into the patio garden to be alone with his seethings the patio was a small paved westfacing area at the rear which was largely deprived of light cut off as it was by the high back wall of the house and by the high wall of some industrial building that backed on to the rear in the middle of it stood for who knew what possible reason a stone sundial if any light at ail fell on the sundial you would know that it was pretty close to noon gmt other than that birds perched on it a few plants sulked in pots dirk jabbed a cigarette in his mouth and burnt a lot of the end of it fiercely dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pick it up pick it up pick i still nagged from inside the house neat garden walls separated the patio on either side trom the gardens of neighbouring houses the one to the left was the same size as this one the one to the right extended a little further benefiting from the fact that the industrial building finished flush with the intervening garden wall there was an air of wellkemptness nothing grand nothing flashy just a sense that all was well and that upkeep on the houses was no problem the house to the right in particular looked as if it had had its brickwork repointed quite recently and its windows reglossed dirk took a large gulp of air and stood for a second staring up into what could be seen of the sky which was grey and hazy a single dark speck was wheeling against the underside of the clouds dirk watched this for a while glad of any focus for his thoughts other than the horrors of the room he had just left he was vaguely aware of comings and goings within the room of a certain amount of tapemeasuring happening of a feeling that photographs were being taken and that severedheadremoval activities were taking place dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pick it up pick it up pick i dont pi somebody at last picked it up the nagging repetition was at last hushed and now the gentle sound of a distant television floated peacefully on the noontime air dirk however was having a great deal of difficulty in taking it all in he was much more aware of taking a succession of huge swimmy whacks to the head which were the assaults of guilt it was not the normal backgroundnoise type of guilt that comes from just being alive this far into the twentieth century and which dirk was usually fairly adept at dealing with it was an actual stunning sense of this specific terrible thing is specifically and terribly my fault all the normal mental moves wouldnt let him get out of the path of the huge pendulum wham it came again whizz wham again and again wham wham wham he tried to remember any of the details of what his late client had said to him but it was virtually impossible with all this whamming taking place the man had said that dirk took a deep breath he was being pursued by a large hairy greeneyed monster armed with a scythe wham dirk had secretly smiled to himself about this whim wham whim wham whim wham and had thought what a silly man whim whim whim whim wham a scythe and a contract he hadnt known or even had the faintest idea as to what the contract was for of course dirk had thought but he had a vague feeling that it might have something to do with a potato there was a bit of a complicated story attached to that dirk had nodded seriously at this point and made a reassuring tick on a pad which he kept on his desk for the express purpose of making reassuring ticks on he had prided himself at that moment on having managed to convey the impression that he had made a tick in a small box marked potatoes wham wham wham wham mr anstey had said he would explain further about the potatoes when dirk arrived to carry out his task and dirk had promised easily casually with an airy wave of his hand wham wham wham to be there at sixthirty in the morning because the contract fell due at seven oclock dirk remembered having made another tick in a notional potato contract falls due at am box he couldnt handle all this whamming any more he couldnt blame himself for what had happened well he could of course he could he did it was in fact his fault the point was that he couldnt continue to blame himself for what had happened and think clearly about it which he was going to have to do he would have to dig this horrible thing up by the roots and if he was going to be fit to do that he had somehow to divest himself of this whamming a huge wave of anger surged over him as he contemplated his predicament and the tangled distress of his life he hated this neat patio he hated all this sundial stuff and all these neatly painted windows all these hideously trim roofs he wanted to blame it all on the paintwork rather than on himself on the revoltingly tidy patio pavingstones on the sheer disgusting abomination of the neatly repointed brickwork excuse me what he whirled round caught unawares by this intrusion into his private raging of a quiet polite voice are you connected with the woman indicated all the unpleasantness and the lowergroundfloorness and the horrible sort of policeness of things next door to her with a little floating movement of her wrist her wrist wore a red bracelet which matched the frames of her glasses she was looking over the garden wall from the house on the right with an air of stightly anxious distaste dirk glared at her speechlessly she looked about forty somethingish and neat with an instant and unmistakable quality of advertising about her she gave a troubled sigh i know its probably all very terrible and everything she said but do you think it will take long we only called in the police because the noise of that ghastly record was driving us up the wall its all a bit she gave him a look of silent appeal and dirk decided that it could all be her fault she could as far as he was concerned take the blame for everything while he sorted it out she deserved it if only for wearing a bracelet like that without a word he turned his back on her and took his fury back inside the house where it began rapidly to freeze into something hard and efficient gilks he said your smartalec suicide theory i like it it works for me and i think i see how the clever bastard pulled it off bring me pen bring me paper he sat down with a flourish at the cherrywood farmhouse table which occupied the centre of the rear portion of the room and deftly sketched out a scheme of events which involved a number of household or kitchen implements a swinging weighted light fitting some very precise timing and hinged on the vital fact that the record turntable was japanese that should keep your forensic chaps happy said dirk briskly to gilks the forensic chaps glanced at it took in its salient points and liked them they were simple implausible and of exactly that nature which a coroner who liked the same sort of holidays in marbella which they did would be sure to relish unless said dirk casually you are interested in the notion that the deceased had entered into some kind of diabolical contract with a supernatural agency for which payment was now being exacted the forensic chaps glanced at each other and shook their heads there was a strong sense from them that the morning was wearing on and that this kind of talk was only introducing unnecessary complications into a case which otherwise could be well behind them before lunch dirk made a satisfied shrug peeled off his share of the evidence and with a final nod to the constabulary made his way back upstairs as he reached the hallway it suddenly became apparent to him that the gentle sounds of daytime television which he had heard from out in the garden had previously been masked from inside by the insistent sound of the record stuck in its groove he was surprised now to realise that they were in fact coming from somewhere upstairs in this house with a quick look round to see that he was not observed he stood on the bottom step of the staircase leading to the upstairs floors of the house and glanced up them in surprise chapter the stairs were carpeted with a tastefully austere matting type of substance dirk quietly made his way up them past some tastefully dried large things in a pot that stood on the first landing and looked into the rooms on the first floor they too were tasteful and dried the larger of the two bedrooms was the only one that showed any signs of current use it had clearly been designed to allow the morning light to play on delicately arranged flowers and duvets stuffed with something like hay but there was a feeling that socks and used shaving heads were instead beginning to gather the room into their grip there was a distinct absence of anything female in the room the same sort of absence that a missing picture leaves behind it on a wall there was an air of tension and of sadness and of things needing to be cleaned out from under the bed the bathroom which opened out from it had a gold disc hung on the wall in front of the lavatory for sales of five hundred thousand copies of a record called hot potato by a band called pugilism and the third autistic cuckoo dirk had a vague recollection of having read part of an interview with the leader of the band there were only two of them and one of them was the leader in a sunday paper he had been asked about their name and he had said that there was an interesting story about it though it turned out not to be it can mean whatever people wantit to mean he had added with a shrug from the sofa of his managers office somewhere off oxford street dirk remembered visualising the journalist nodding politely and writing this down a vile knot had formed in dirks stomach which he had eventually softened with gin hot potato thought dirk it suddenly occurred to him looking at the gold disc hanging in its red frame that the record on which the late mr ansteys head had been perched was obviously this one hot potato dont pick it up what could that mean whatever people wanted it to mean dirk thought with bed grace the other thing that he remembered now about the interview was that pain the leader of pugilism and the third autistic cuckoo was called pain claimed to have written the lyrics down more or less verbatim from a conversation which he or somebody had overheard in a cafe or a sauna or an aeroplane or something like that dirk wondered how the originators of the conversation would feel to hear their words being repeated in the circumstances in which he had just heard them he peered more closely at the label in the centre of the gold record at the top of the label it said simply arrgh while underneath the actual title were the writers credits paignton mulville anstey mulville was presumably the member of pugilism and the third autistic cuckoo who wasnt the leader and geoff ansteys inclusion on the writing credits of a majorselling single was probably what had paid for this house when anstey had talked about the contract having something to do with potato he had assumed that dirk knew what he meant and he dirk had as easily assumed that anstey was blithering lt was very easy to assume that someone who was talking about greeneyed monsters with scythes was also blithering when he talked about potatoes dirk sighed to himself with deep uneasiness he took a dislike to the neat way the trophy was hanging on the wall and adjusted it a little so that it hung at a more humane and untidy angle doing this caused an envelope to fall out from behind the frame and flutter towards the floor dirk tried unsuccessfully to catch it with an unfit grunt he bent over and picked the thing up it was a largish cream envelope of rich heavy paper roughly slit open at one end and resealed with sellotape in fact it looked as if it had been opened and resealed with fresh layers of tape many times an impression which was borne out by the number of names to which the envelope had in its time been addressed each successively crossed out and replaced by another the last name on it was that of geoff anstey at least dirk assumed it was the last name because it was the only one that had not been crossed out and crossed out heavily dirk peered at some of the other names trying to make them out some memory was stirred by a couple of the names which he could just about discern but he needed to examine the envelope much more closely he had been meaning to buy himself a magnifying glass ever since he had become a detective but had never got around to it he also did not possess a penknife so reluctantly he decided that the most prudent course was to tuck the envelope away for the moment in one of the deeper recesses of his coat and examine it later in privacy he glanced quickly behind the frame of the gold disc to see if any other goodies might emerge but was disappointed and so he quit the bathroom and resumed his exploration of the house the other bedroom was neat and soulless unused a pine bed a duvet and an old battered chest of drawers that had been revived by being plunged into a vat of acid were its main features dirk pulled the door of it closed behind him and started to ascend the small wobbly whitepainted stairway that led up to an attic from which the sounds of bugs bunny could be heard at the top of the stairs was a minute landing which opened on one side into a bathroom so small that it would best be used by standing outside and sticking into it whichever limb you wanted to wash the door to it was kept ajar by a length of green hosepipe which trailed from the cold tap of the washbasin out of the bathroom across the landing and into the only other room here at the top of the house it was an attic room with a severely pitched roof which offered only a few spots where a person of anything approaching average height could stand up dirk stood hunched in the doorway and surveyed its contents nervous of what he might find amongst them there was a general grunginess about the place the curtains were closed and little light made it past them into the room which was otherwise illuminated only by the flickering glow of an animated rabbit an unmade bed with dank screwedup sheets was pushed under a particularly low angle of the ceiling part of the walls and the more nearly vertical surfaces of the ceiling were covered with pictures crudely cut out of magazines there didnt seem to be any common theme or purpose behind the cuttings as well as a couple of pictures of flashy german cars and the odd bra advertisement there were also a badly torn picture of a fruit flan part of an advertisement for life insurance and other random fragments which suggested they had been selected and arranged with a dull bovine indifference to any meaning that any of them might have or effect they might achieve the hosepipe curled across the floor and led around the side of an elderly armchair pulled up in front of the television set the rabbit rampaged the glow of his rampagings played on the frayed edges of the armchair bugs was wrestling with the controls of an aeroplane which was plunging to the ground suddenly he saw a button marked autopilot and pressed it a cupboard opened and a robot pilot clambered out took one look at the situation and baled out the plane hurtled on towards the ground but luckily ran out of fuel just before reaching it and so the rabbit was saved dirk could also see the top of a head the hair of this head was dark matted and greasy dirk watched it for a long uneasy moment before advancing slowly into the room to see what if anything it was attached to his relief at discovering as he rounded the armchair that the head was after all attached to a living body was a little marred by the sight of the living body to which it was attached slumped in the armchair was a boy he was probably about thirteen or fourteen and although he didnt look ill in any specific physical way he was definitely not a well person his hair sagged on his head his head sagged on his shoulders and he lay in the armchair in a sort of limp crumpled way as if hed been hurled there from a passing train he was dressed merely in a cheap leather jacket and sleepingbag dirk stared at him who was he what was a boy doing here watching television in a house where someone had just been decapitated did he know what had happened did gilks know about him had gilks even bothered to come up here it was after all several flights of stairs for a busy policeman with a tricky suicide on his hands after dirk had been standing there for twenty seconds or so the boys eyes climbed up towards him failed utterly to acknowledge him in any way at all and then dropped again and locked back on to the rabbit dirk was unused to making quite such a minuscule impact on anybody he checked to be sure that he did have his huge leather coat and his absurd red hat on and that he was properly and dramatically silhouetted by the light of the doorway he felt momentarily deflated and said er by way of self introduction but it didnt get the boys attention he didnt like this the kid was deliberately and maliciously watching television at him he frowned there was a kind of steamy tension building in the room it seemed to dirk a kind of difficult hissing quality to the whole air of the place which he did not know how to respond to it rose in intensity and then suddenly ended with an abrupt click which made dirk start the boy unwound himself like a slow fat snake leaned sideways over the far side of the armchair and made some elaborate unseen preparations which clearly involved as dirk now realised an electric kettle when he resumed his earlier splayed posture it was with the addition of a plastic pot clutched in his right hand from which he forked rubbery strands of steaming gunk into his mouth the rabbit brought his affairs to a conclusion and gave way to a jeering comedian who wished the viewers to buy a certain brand of lager on the basis of nothing better than his own hardly disinterested sayso dirk felt that it was time to make a slightly greater impression on the proceedings than he had so far managed to do he stepped forward dinectly into the boys line of sight kid dirk said in a tone that he hoped would sound firm but gentle and not in any way at all patronising or affected or gauche i need to know who he was distracted at that moment by the sight which met him from the new position in which he was standing on the other side of the armchair there was a large half full cateringsize box of pot noodles a large half full cateringsize box of mars bars a half demolished pyramid of cans of soft drink and the end of the hosepipe the hosepipe ended in a plastic tap nozzle and was obviously used for refilling the kettle dirk had simply been going to ask the boy who he was but seen from this angle the family resemblance was unmistakable he was clearly the son of the lately decapitated geoffrey anstey perhaps this behaviour was just his way of dealing with shock or perhaps he really didnt know what had happened or perhaps he dirk hardly liked to think in fact he was finding it hard to think clearly while the television beside him was on behalf of a toothpaste manufacturing company trying to worry him deeply about some of the things which might be going on in his mouth ok he said i dont like to disturb you at what i know must be a difficult and distressing time for you but i need to know first of all if you actually realise that this is a difficult and distressing time for you nothing all right thought dirk time for a little judicious toughness he leant back against the wall stuck his hands in his pockets in an okifthatsthewayyouwanttoplayit manner stared moodily at the floor for a few seconds then swung his head up and let the boy have a hard look right between the eyes i have to tell you kid he said tersely your fathers dead this might have worked if it hadnt been for a very popular and longrunning commercial which started at that moment it seemed to dirk to be a particularly astounding example of the genre the opening sequence showed the angel lucifer being hurled from heaven into the pit of hell where he then lay on a buming lake until a passing demon amved and gave him a can of a fizzy soft drink called shades lucifer took it and tried it he greedily guzzled the whole contents of the can and then tumed to camera slipped on some porsche design sunglasses said now were really cookin and lay back basking in the glow of the burning coals being heaped around him at that point an impossibly deep and growly american voice which sounded as if it had itself crawled from the pit of hel or at least from a soho basement drinking club to which it was keen to return as soon as possible to marinade itself into shape for the next voiceover said shades the drink from hell and the can revolved a little to obscure the initial s and thus spell hades the theology of this seemed a little confused reflected dirk but what was one tiny extra droplet of misinformation in such a raging torrent lucifer then mugged at the camera again and said i could really fall for this stuff and just in case the viewer had been rendered completely insensate by all these goingson the opening shot of lucifer being hurled from heaven was briefly replayed in order to emphasise the word fall the boys attention was entirely captivated by this dirk squatted down in between the boy and the screen listen to me he began the boy craned his neck round to look past dirk at the screen he had to redistribute his limbs in the chair in order to be able to do this and continue to fork pot noodle into himself listen insisted dirk again dirk felt he was beginning to be in serious danger of losing the upper hand in the situation it wasnt merely that the boys attention was on the television it was that nothing else seemed to have any meaning or independent existence for him at all dirk was merely a featureless object in the way of the television the boy seemed to bear him no malice he merely wished to see past him look can we turn this off for a moment dirk said and he tried not to make it sound testy the boy did not respond maybe there was a slight stiffening of the shoulders maybe it was a shrug dirk turned around and was at a loss to find which button to push to turn the television off the whoie control pane seemed to be dedicated to the single purpose of keeping itself turned on there was no single button marked on or off eventually dirk simply disconnected the set from the power socket on the wall and turned back to the boy who broke his nose dirk felt his septum crunching from the terrific impact of the boys forehead as they both toppled heavily backwards against the set but the noise of the bone breaking and the noise of his own cry of pain as it broke was completely obliterated by the howling screams of rage that erupted from the boys throat dirk flailed helplessly to try and protect himself from the fury of the onslaught but the boy was on top with his elbow in dirks eye his knees pounding first on dirks ribcage then his jaw and then on dirks already traumatised nose as he scrambled over him to reconnect the power to the television he then settled back comfortably into the armchair and watched with a moody and unsettled eye as the picture reassembled itself you could at least have waited for the news he said in a dull voice dirk gaped at him he sat huddled on the floor coddling his bleeding nose in his hands and gaped at the monstrously disinterested creature whhfff fffmmm nnggh he protested and then gave up for the time being while he probed his nose for the damage there was definitely a wobbly bit that clicked nastily between his fingers and the whole thing seemed suddenly to be a horribly unfamiliar shape he fished a handkerchief out of his pocket and held it up to his face blood spread easily through it he staggered to his feet brushed aside nonexistent offers of help stomped out of the room and into the tiny bathroom there he yanked the hosepipe angrily off the tap found a towel soaked it in cold water and held it to his face for a minute or two until the flow of blood gradually slowed to a trickle and stopped he stared at himself in the mirror his nose was quite definitely leaning at a slightly rakish angle he tried bravely to shift it but not bravely enough it hurt abominably so he contented himself with dabbing at it a little more with the wet towel and swearing quietly then he stood there for a second or two longer leaning against the basin breathing heavily and practising saying all right fiercely into the mirror it came out as awwbwigh and lacked any real authority when he felt sufficiently braced or at least as braced as he was likely to feel in the immediate future he turned and stalked grimly back into the den of the beast the beast was sitting quietly absorbing news of some of the exciting and stimulating game shows that the evening held in store for the determined viewer and did not look up as dirk reentered dirk walked briskly over to the window and drew the curtains sharply back half hoping that the beast might shrivel up shrieking if exposed to daylight but other than wrinkling up its nose it did not react a dark shadow flapped briefly across the window but the angle was such that dirk could not see what caused it he turned and faced the boybeast the midday news bulletin was starting on television and the boy seemed somehow a little more open a little more receptive to the world outside the flickering coloured rectangle he glanced up at dirk with a sour tired look whaddayawananyway he said i ted you whad i wad said dirk fiercely but hopelessly i wadhag od a bobedi gnow thad faith dirks attention had switched suddenly to the television screen where a rather more uptodate photograph of the missing airline checkin girl was being shown whadayadoingere said the boy jjchhhhh said dirk and perched himself down on the arm of the chair peering intently at the face on the screen it had been taken about a year ago before the girl had learnt about corporate lipgloss she had frizzy hair and a frumpy putupon look whoareyou wassgoinon insisted the boy loog chuddub snapped dirk ib tryid to wodge dthith the newscaster said that the police professed themselves to be mystified by the fact that there was no trace of janice smith at the scene of the incident they explained that there was a limit to the number of times they could search the same buildings and appealed for anyone who might have a clue as to her whereabouts to come forward thadth by segradry thadth mith pearth exclaimed dirk in astonishment the boy was not interested in dirks exsecnetary and gave up trying to atttact dirks attention he wriggled out of the sleepingbag and sloped off to the bathroom dirk sat staring at the television bewildered that he hadnt realised before who the missing girl was still there was no reason why he should have done he realiced marriage had changed her name and this was the first time they had shown a photograph that actually identified her so far he had taken no real interest in the strange incident at the airport but now it demanded his attention the explosion was now officially designated an act of god but thought dirk what god and why what god would be hanging around terminal two of fieathrow aitport trying to catch the flight to oslo after the miserable lassitude of the last few weeks he suddenly had a great deal that required his immediate attention he frowned in deep thought for a few moments and hardly noticed when the beastboy snuck back in and snuggled back into his sleepingbag just in time for the advertisements to start the first one showed how a perfectly ordinary stock cube could form the natural focus of a normal happy family life dirk leapt to his feet but even as he was about to start questioning the boy again his heart sank as he looked at him the beast was far away sunk back in his dark flickering lair and dirk did not feel inclined to disturb him again at the moment he contented himself with barking at the unresponding child that he would be back and bustled heavily down the stairs his big leather coat flapping madly behind him in the hallway he encountered the loathed gilks once more what happened to you said the policeman sharply catching sight of dirks bruised and bulging nose ondly whad you dold me said dirk innocently i bead bythelf ub gilks demanded to know what he had been doing and dirk generously explained that there was a witness upstairs with some interesting information to impart he suggested that gilks go and have a word with him but that it would be best if he turned off the television first gilks nodded curtly he started to go up the stairs but dirk stopped him doedth eddydthig dthrike you adth dthraydge aboud dthidth houdth he said what did you say said gilks in irritation subbthig dthraydge said dirk something what dthraydge insisted dirk strange dthadth right dthraydge gilks shrugged like what he said id dtheemdth to be cobbleedly dthouledth completely what dthouledth he tried again thoulleth i dthigg dthadth dverry idderedthigg with that he doffed his hat politely and swept on out of the house and up the street where an eagle swooped out of the sky at him and came within a whisker of causing him to fall under a bus on its way south for the next twenty minutes hideous yells and screams emanated from the top floor of the house in lupton road and caused much tension among the neighbours the ambulance took away the upper and lower remains of mr anstey and also a policeman with a bleeding face for a short while after this there was quietness then another police car drew up outside the house a lot o bobs here type of remarks floated from the house as an extremely large and burly policeman heaved himself out of the car and bustled up the steps a few minutes and a great deal of screaming and yelling later he reemerged also clutching his face and drove off in deep dudgeon squealing his tyres in a violent and unnecessary manner twenty minutes later a van arrived from which emerged another policeman carrying a tiny pocket television set he entered the house and reemerged a short while later leading a docile thirteenyearold boy who was content with his new toy once all policemen had departed save for the single squad car which remained parked outside to keep watch on the house a large hairy greeneyed figure emerged from its hiding place behind one of the molecules in the large basement room it propped its scythe against one of the hifi speakers dipped a long gnarled finger in the almost congealed pool of blood that had collected on the deck of the turntable smeared the finger across the bottom of a sheet of thick yellowing paper and then disappeared off into a dark and hidden otherworld whistling a strange and vicious tune and returning only briefly to collect its scythe chapter a little earlier in the morning at a comfortable distance from all these events set at a comfortable distance from a wellproponioned window through which cool midmorning light was streaming lay an elderly oneeyed man in a white bed a newspaper sat like a halfcollapsed tent on the floor where it had been hurled two minutes before at shortly aher ten oclock by the clock on the bedside table the room was not large but was furnished in excessively bland good taste as if it were a room in an expensive private hospital or clinic which is exactly what it was the woodshead hospital set in its own small but wellkempt grounds on the outskirts of a small but wellkempt village in the cotswolds the man was awake but not glad to be his skin was very delicately old like finely stretched translucent parchment delicately freckled his exquisitely frail hands lay slightly curled on the pure white linen sheets and quivered very faintly his name was variously given as mr odwin or wodin or odin he was is a god and furthermore he was that least good of all gods to be alongside a cross god his one eye glinted he was cross because of what he had been reading in the newspapers which was that another god had been cutting loose and making a nuisance of himself it didnt say that in the papers of course it didnt say god cuts loose makes nuisance of himself in airport it merely described the resulting devastation and was at a loss to draw any meaningful conclusions from it the story had been deeply unsatisfactory in all sorts of ways on account of its perplexing inconclusiveness its goingnowhereness and the irritating from the newspapers point of view lack of any good solid carriage there was of course a mystery attached to the lack of carnage but a newspaper preferred a good whack of carnage to a mere mystery any day of the week odin however had no such difficulty in knowing what was going on the accounts had thor written all over them in letters much too big for anyone other than another god to see he had thrown this mornings paper aside in irritation and was now trying to concentrate on his relaxation exercises in order to avoid getting too disturbed about all this these involved breathing in in a certain way and breathing out in a certain other way and were good for his blood pressure and so on it was not as if he was about to die or anything ha but there was no doubt that at his time of life ha he preferred to take things easy and look after himself best of all he liked to sleep sleeping was a very important activity for him he liked to sleep for longish periods great swathes of time merely sleeping overnight was not taking the business seriously he enjoyed a good nights sleep and wouldnt miss one for the world but he didnt regard it as anything even half approaching enough he liked to be asleep by half past eleven in the morning if possible and if that could come directly after a nice leisurely liein then so much the better a little light breakfast and a quick trip to the bathroom while fresh linen was applied to his bed is really all the astivity he liked to undertake and he took care that it didnt jangle the sleepiness out of him and thus disturb his afternoon of napping sometimes he was able to spend an entire week asleep and this he regarded as a good snooze he had also slept through the whole of and hadnt missed it but he knew to his deep disgruntlement that he would shortly have to arise and undertake a sacred and irritating trust sacred because it was godlike or at least involved gods and irritating because of the particular god that it involved sneakily he twitched the curtains at a distance using nothing but his divine will he sighed heavily he needed to think and what was more it was time for his morning visit to the bathroom he rang for the orderly the orderly arrived promptly in his wellpressed loose green tunic goodmorninged cheerfully and bustled around locating bedroom slippers and dressinggown he helped odin out of bed which was a little like rolling a stuffed crow out of a box and escorted him slowly to the bathroom odin walked stiffly like a head hung between two heavy stilts draped in striped viyella and white towelling the orderly knew odin as mr odwin and didnt realise that he was a god which was something that odin tended to keep quiet about and wished that thor would too thor was the god of thunder and frankly acted like it it was inappropriate he seemed unwilling or unable or maybe just too stupid to understand or acceptodin stopped himself he sensed that he was beginning mentally to rant he would have to consider calmly what next to do about thor and he was on his way to the right place for a good think as soon as odin had completed his stately hobble to the bathroom door two nurses hurried in and stripped and remade the bed with immense precision patting down the fresh linen pulling it taut turning it and tucking it one of the nurses clearly the senior was plump and matronly the other younger darker and more generally birdlike the newspaper was whisked off the tloor and neatly refolded the floor was briskly hoovered the curtains hooked back the flowers and the untouched fruit replaced with fresh flowers and fresh fruit that would like every piece of fruit before them remain untouched when after a little while the old gods morning ablutions had been completed and the bathroom door reopened the room had been transformed the actual differences were tiny of course but the effect was of a subtle but magical transformation into something cool and fresh odin nodded in quiet satisfaction to see it he made a little show of inspecting the bed like a monarch inspecting a line of soldiers is it well tucked he asked in his old and whispery voice it is very well tucked mr odwin said the senior nurse with an obsequious beam is it neatly turned it clearly was this was merely a ritual turned very neatly indeed mr odwin said the nurse i supervised the turning down of the sheets myself im glad of that sister bailey very glad said odin you have a fine eye for a trimly turned fold it alarms me to know what i shall do without you well im not about to go anywhere mr odwin said sister bailey oozing happy reassurance but you wont last for ever sister bailey said odin it was a remark that puzzled sister bailey on the times she had heard it because of its apparent extreme callousness sure and none of us lasts for over mr odwin she said gently as she and the other nurse between them managed the difficult task of lifting odin back into hed while keeping his dignity intact youre irish arent you sister bailey he asked once he was properly settled i am indeed so mr odwin knew an irishman once finn something told me a lot of stuff i didnt need to know never told me about the linen still know now he nodded curtly at this memory and lowered his head stiffly back on to the firmly plumped up pillows and ran the back of his finely freckled hand over the foldedback linen sheet quite simply he was in love with linen clean lightly starched white irish linen pressed folded tucked the words themselves were almost a litany of desire for him in centuries nothing had obsessed him or moved him so much as linen now did he could not for the life of him understand how he could ever have cared for anything else linen and sleep sleep and linen sleep in linen sleep sister bailey regarded him with a sort of proprietary fondness she did not know that he was a god as such in fact she thought he was probably an old film producer or nazi war criminal certainly he had an accent she couldnt quite place and his careless civility his natural selfishness and his obsession with personal hygiene spoke of a past that was rich with horrors if she could have been transported to where she might see her secretive patient enthroned warrior father of the wamor gods of asgard she would not have been surprised that is not quite true in fact she would have been startled quite out of her wits but she would at least have recognised that it was consistent with the qualities she perceived in him once she had recovered from the shock of discovering that virtually everything the human race had ever chosen to believe in was true or that it continued to be true long after the human race particularly needed it to be true any more odin dismissed his medical attendants with a gesture having first asked for his personal assistant to be found and sent to him once more this caused sister bailey to tighten her lips just a very little she did not like mr odwins personal assistant general factotum manservant call him what you will his eyes were malevolent he made her jump and she strongly suspected him of making unspeakabie suggestions to her nurses during their tea breaks he had what sister bailey supposed was what people meant by an olive complexion in that it was extraordinarily close to being green sister bailey was convinced that it was not right at all she was of course the last person to judge somebody by the colour of their skin or if not absolutely the last she had at least done it as recently as yesterday afternoon when an african diplomat had been brought in to have some gallstones removed and she had conceived an instant resentment of him she didnt like him she couldnt say exactly what it was she didnt like about him because she was a nurse not a taxidriver and she wouldnt let her personal feelings show for an instant she was much too professional much too good at her job and treated everyone with a more or less equal efficient and cheerful courtesy even she thought and a profound iciness settled on her at this point even mr rag mr rag was the name of mr odwins personal assistant there was nothing she could do about it it was not her place to criticise mr odwins personal arrangements but if it had been her business which it wasnt then she would greatly have preferred it and not just for herself but for mr odwins own wellbeing as well which was the important thing if he could have employed someone who didnt give her the absolute heebiejeebies that was all she thought no more about it merely went to look for him she had been relieved to discover when she came on duty this morning that mr rag had left the premises the previous night but had then with a keen sense of disappointment spotted him returning about an hour or so ago she found him exactly where he was not supposed to be he was squatting on one of the seats in the visitors waitingroom wearing what looked horribly like a soiled and discarded doctors gown that was much too big for him not only that but he was playing a thinly unmusical tune on a sort of pipe that he had obviously carved out of a large disposable hypodermic syringe which he absolutely should not have had he glanced up at her with his quick dancing eyes grinned and continued to tootle and squeak only significantly louder sister bailey ran through in her mind all the things that it was completely pointless to say about either the roat or the syringe or about him being in the visitors room frightening or preparing to frighten the visitors she knew she wouldnt be able to stand the air of injured innocence with which he would reply or the preposterous absurdity of his answers her only course was simply to let it pass and just get him away from the room and out of the way as quickly as possible mr odwin would like to see you she said she tried to jam some of her normal lilting quality into her voice but it just wouldnt go she wished his eyes would stop dancing like that apart from finding it highly disturbing from both a medical and aesthetic point of view she also could not help but be piqued by the impression it conveyed that there were at least thirtyseven things in the room more interesting than her he gazed at her in this disconcerting manner for a few seconds then muttering that there was no peace for the wicked not even the extremely wicked he pushed past sister bailey and skedaddled up the corridor to receive instructions from his lord and master quickly before his lord and master fell asleep chapter by the end of the morning kate had discharged herself from hospital there were some initial difficulties involved in this because first the ward sister and then the doctor in charge of kates case were adamant that she was in no fit state to leave she had only just emerged from a minor coma and she needed care she needed pizza insisted kate rest she needed my own home and fresh air the air in here is horrible it smells like a vacuum cleaners armpit further medication and should definitely remain under observation for another day or so until they were satisfied that she had made a full recovery at least they were fairly adamant during the course of the morning kate demanded and got a telephone and started trying to order pizza to be delivered to her ward she phoned around all of the least cooperative pizza restaurants she knew in london harangued them then made some noisily unsuccessful attempts to muster a motorbike to roam around the west end and try and pick up for her an american hot with a list of additional peppers and mushrooms and cheeses which the controller of the courier service refused even to attempt to remember and after an hour or so of this sort of behaviour the objections to kate discharging herself from the hospital gradually fell away like petals from an autumn rose and so a little after lunchtime she was standing on a bleak west london street feeling weak and shaky but in charge of herself she had with her the empty tattered remains of the garment bag which she had refused to relinquish and also a small scrap of paper in her purse which had a single name scribbled on it she hailed a taxi and sat in the back with her eyes closed most of the way back to her home in primrose hill she climbed up the stairs and let herself into her toptloor flat there were ten messages on her answering machine which she simply erased without listening to she threw open the window in her bedroom and for a moment or two leaned out of it at the rather dangerous and awkward angle which allowed her to see a patch of the park it was a small comer patch with just a couple of plane trees standing in it the backs of some of the intervening houses framed it or rather just failed totally to obscure it and made it very personal and private to kate in a way which a vast sweeping vista would not have been on one occasion she had gone to this corner of the park and walked around the invisible perimeter that marked out the limits of what she could see and had come very close to feeling that this was her own domain she had even patted the plane trees in a proprietorial sort of way and had then sat beneath them watching the sun going down over london over its badly spoiled skyline and its nondelivering pizza restaurants and had come away with a profound sense of something or other though she wasnt quite certain what still she had told herself these days she should feel grateful for a profound sense of anything at all however unspecific she hauled herself in from the window left it wide open in spite of the chill of the outside air padded through into the small bathroom and ran the bath it was a bath of the sprawling edwardian type which took up a wonderfully disproportionate amount of the space available and encompassed most of the rest of the room with creampainted pipes the taps seethed as soon as the room was sufficiently full of steam to be warm kate undressed and then went and opened the large bathroom cupboard she felt faintly embarrassed by the sheer profusion of things she had for putting in baths but she was for some reason incapable of passing any chemist or herb shop without going in to be seduced by some glassstoppered bottle of something blue or green or orange and oily that was supposed to restore the natural balance of some vague substance she didnt even know she was supposed to have in her pores she paused trying to choose something pink something with extra vitamin b vitamin b b just the number of things with different types of vitamin b in them was an embarrassment of choice in itself there were powders as well as oils tubes of gel even packets of some kind of pungent smelling seed that was meant to be good for some obscure part of you in some arcane way how about some of the green crystals one day she had told herself in the past she would not even bother trying to choose but would simply put a bit of everything in when she really felt in need of it she rather thought that today was the day and with a sudden reviving rush of pleasure she set about puaing a drop or two of everything in the cupboard into the seething bath until it was confused with mingling muddying colours and verging on the glutinous to touch she turned off the taps went to her handbag for a moment then returned and lowered herself into the bath where she lay with her eyes closed breathing slowly for fully three minutes before at last turning her attention to the scrap of paper she had brought with her from the hospital it had one word on it and it was a word she had dragged out of an oddly reluctant young nurse who had taken her temperature that morning kate had questioned her about the big man the big man whom she had encountered at the airport whose body she had seen in a nearby side ward in the early hours of the night oh no the nurse had said he wasnt dead he was just in some sort of coma could she see him kate had asked what was his name she had tried to ask idly in passing as it were which was a difficult trick to pull off with a thermometer in her mouth and she wasnt at all certain she had succeeded the nurse had said that she couldnt really say she wasnt really meant to talk about other patients and anyway the man wasnt there any more he had been taken somewhere else they had sent an ambulance to collect him and take him somewhere else this had taken kate considerably by surprise where had they taken him what was this special place but the nurse had been unwilling to say anything much more and a second or two later had been summoned away by the sister the only word the nurse had said was the one that kate had then scribbled down on the piece of paper she was now looking at the word was woodshead now that she was more relaxed she had a feeling that the name was familiar to her in some way though she could not remember where she had heard it the instant she remembered she could not stay in the bath any longer but got out and made straight for the telephone pausing only briefly to shower all the gunk off her chapter the big man awoke and tried to look up but could hardly raise his head he tried to sit up but couldnt do that either he felt as if hed been stuck to the floor with superglue and after a few seconds he discovered the most astounding reason for this he jerked his head up violently yanking out great tufts of yellow hair which stayed painfully stuck to the floor and looked around him he was in what appeared to be a derelict warehouse probably an upper floor judging by the wintry sky he could see creeping past the grimy shattered windows the ceilings were high and hung with cobwebs built by spiders who did not seem to mind that most of what they caught was crumbling plaster and dust they were supported by pillars made from upright steel joists on which the dirty old cream paint was bubbled and flaking and these in turn stood on a floor of battered old oak on to which he had clearly been glued extending out for a foot or two in a rough oval all around his naked body the floor glistened darkly and dully thin nostrilcleaning fumes rose from it he could not believe it he roared with rage tried to wriggle and shake himself but succeeded only in tugging painfully at his skin where it was stuck fast to the oak planks this had to be the old mans doing he threw his head back hard against the floor in a blow that cracked the boards and made his ears sing he roared again and took some furious satisfaction in making as much hopeless stupid noise as he could he roared until the steel pillars rang and the cracked remains of the windows shattered into finer shards then as he threw his head angrily from one side to the other he caught sight of his sledgehammer leaning against the wall a few feet from him heaved it up into the air with a word and sent it hurtling round the great space beating and clanging on every pillar until the whole building reverberated like a mad gong another word and the hammer flew back at him missed his head by a handswidth and punched straight down through the floor shattering the wood and the plaster below in the darker space beneath him the hammer spun and swung round in a slow heavy parabola as bits of plaster fell about it and rattled on the concrete floor below then it gathered a violent momentum and hurtled back up through the ceiling smacking up a stack of startled splinters as it punched through another oak floorboard a handswidth from the soles of the big mans feet it soared up into the air hung there for a moment as if its weight had suddenly vanished then deftly flicking its short handle up above its head it drove hard back down through the tloor again then up again then down again punching holes in a splintered ring around its master until with a long heavy groan the whole oval section of punctured floor gave way and plunged twisting through the air it shattered itself against the floor below amidst a rain of plaster debris from which the figure of the big man then emerged staggering flapping at the dusty air and coughing his back his arms and his legs were still covered with great splintered hunks of oak flooring but at least he was able to move he leant the flat of his hands against the wall and violently coughed some of the dast from his lungs as he turned back his hammer danced out of the air towards him then suddenly evaded his grasp and skidded joyfully off across the floor striking sparks from the concrete with its great head flipped up and parked itself against a nearby pillar at a jaunty angle in front of him the shape of a large cocacola vending machine loomed through the settling cloud of dust he regarded it with the gravest suspicion and worry it stood there with a sort of glazed blank look to it and had a note from his father stuck on the front panel saying whatever he was doing stop it it was signed youknowwho but this had been crossed out and first the word odin and then in larger letters your father had been substituted odin never ceased to make absolutely clear his view of his sons intellectual accomplishments the big man tore the note off and stared at it in anger a postscript added darkly remember wales you dont want to go through all that again he screwed the note up and hurled it out of the nearest window where the wind whipped it up and away for a moment he thought he heard an odd squeaking noise but it was probably just the blustering of the wind as it whistled between the nearby derelict buildings he turned and walked to the window and stared out of it in a belligerent sulk glued to the floor at his age what the devil was that supposed to mean keep your head down was what he guessed if you dont keep it down ill have to keep it down for you that was what it meant stick to the ground he remembered now the old man saying exactly that to him at the time of all the unpleasantness with the phantom fighter jet why cant you just stick to the ground he had said he could imagine the old man in his softheaded benign malice thinking it very funny to make the lesson so literal rage began to rumble menacingly inside him but he pushed it down hard very worrying things had recently begun happening when he got angry and he had a bad feeling looking back at the cocacola vending machine that another of those very worrying things must have just happened he stared at it and fretted he felt ill he had felt ill a lot of late and he found it impossible to discharge what were left of his godly duties when he felt he was suffering from a sort of continual lowgrade flu he experienced headaches dizzy spells guilt and all the sorts of ailments that were featured so often in television advertisements he even suffered terrifying blackouts whenever the great rage gripped him he always used to have such a wonderful time getting angry great gusts of marvellous anger would hurl him through life he felt huge he felt flooded with power and light and energy he had always been provided with such wonderful things to get angry about immense acts of provocation or betrayal people hiding the atiantic ocean in his helmet dropping continents on him or getting drunk and pretending to be trees stuff you could really work up a rage about and hit things in short he had felt good about being a thunder god now suddeniy it was headaches nervous tension nameless anxieties and guilt these were new experiences for a god and not pleasant ones you look ridiculous the voice screeched out and affected thor like fingernails scratched across a blackboard lodged in the back of his brain it was a mean voice a spiteful jeering voice a cheap white nylon shirt of a voice a shinytrousered pencil moustache of a voice a voice in short which thor did not like he reacted very badly to it at the best of times and was particularly provoked to have to hear it while standing naked in the middle of a decrepit warehouse with large sections of an oak floor still stuck to his back he spun round angrily he wanted to be able to turn round calmly and with crushing dignity but no such strategy ever worked with this creature and since he thor would only end up feeling humiliated and ridiculous whatever postune he adopted he might as well go with one he felt comfortable with toe rag he roared yanked his hammer spinning into the air and hurled it with immense stunning force at the small creature who was squatting complacently in the shadows on top of a small heap of rubble leaning forward a little toe rag caught the hammer and placed it neatly on top of the pile of thors clothes that lay next to him he grinned and allowed a stray shaft of sunlight to glitter on one of his teeth these things dont happen by accident toe rag had spent some time while thor was unconscious working out how long it would take him to recover then industriously moving the pile of rubble to exactly this spot checking the height and then calculating the exact angle at which to lean as a provocateur he regarded himself as a professional did you do this to me roared thor did you thor searched for any way of saying glue me to the floor that didnt sound like glue me to floor but eventually the pause got too long and he had to give up glue me to the floor he demanded at last he wished he hadnt asked such a stupid question dont even answer that he added angrily and wished he hadnt said that either he stamped his foot and shook the foundations of the building a little just to make the point he wasnt certain what the point was but he felt that it had to be made some dust settled gently around him toe rag watched him with his dancing glittering eyes i merely carry out the instructions given to me by your father he said in a grotesque parody of obsequiousness it seems to me said thor that the instructions my father has been giving since you entered his service have been very odd i think you have some kind of evil grip on him i dont know what kind of evil grip it is but its definitely a grip and its definitely synonyms failed him evil he concluded toe rag reacted like an iguana to whom someone had just complained about the wine me he protested how can i possibly have a grip on your father odin is the greatest of the gods of asgard and i am his devoted servant in all things odin says do this and i do it odin says go there and i go there odin says go and get my big stupid son out of hospital before he causes any more trouble and then i dont know glue him to the floor or something and i do exactly as he asks i am merely the most humble of functionaries however small or menial the task odins bidding is what i am there to perform thor was not sufficiently subtle a student of human nature or for that matter divine or goblin nature to be able to argue that this was in fact a very powerful grip to hold over anybody particularly a fallible and pampered old god he just knew that it was all wrong well then he shouted take this message back to my father odin tell him that i thor the god of thunder demand to meet him and not in his damned hospital either im not going to hang about reading magazines and looking at fruit while he has his bed changed tell him that thor the god of thunder will meet odin the father of the gods of asgard tonight at the challenging hour in the halls of asgard again said toe rag with a sly glance sideways at the cocacola vending machine er yes said thor yes he repeated in a rage again toe rag made a tiny sigh such as one who felt resigned to carrying out the bidding of a temperamental simpleton might make and said well ill tell him i dont suppose he will be best pleased it is no matter of yours whether he is pleased or not shouted thor disturbing the foundations of the building once more this is between my father and myself you may think yourself very clever toe rag and you may think that i am not toe rag arched an eyebrow he had prepared for this moment he stayed silent and merely let the stray beatn of sunlight glint on his dancing eyes it was a silence of the most profound eloquence i may not know what youto up to toe rag i may not know a lot of things but i do know one thing i know that i am thor the god of thunder and that i will not be made a fool of by a goblin well said toe rag with a light grin when you know two things i expect youll be twice as clever remember to put your clothes on before you go out he gestured casually at the pile beside him and departed chapter the trouble with the sort of shop that sells things like magnifying glasses and penknives is that they tend also to sell all kinds of other fascinating things like the quite extraordinary device with which dirk eventually emerged after having been hopelessly unable to decide between the knife with the builtin philips screwdriver toothpick and ballpoint pen and the one with the tooth gristle saw and the tigwelded rivets the magnifying glasses had held him in thrall for a short while particularly the diopter highindex vacuumdeposited goldcoated glass model with the integral handle and mount and the notchless seal glazing but then dirk had happened to catch sight of a small electronic i ching calculator and he was lost he had never before even guessed at the existence of such a thing and to be able to move from total ignorance of something to total desire for it and then actually to own the thing all within the space of about forty seconds was for dirk something of an epiphany the electronic i ching calculator was badly made it had probably been manufactured in whichever of the southeast asian countries was busy tooling up to do to south korea what south korea was busy doing to japan giue technology had obviously not progressed in that country to the point where things could be successfully held together with it already the back had half fallen off and needed to be stuck back on with sellotape it was much like an ordinary pocket calculator except that the lcd screen was a little larger than usual in order to accommodate the abridged judgements of king wen on each of the sixtyfour hexagrams and also the commentaries of his son the duke of chou on each of the lines of each hexagram these were unusual texts to see marching across the display of a pocket calculator particularly as they had been translated from the chinese via the japanese and seemed to have enjoyed many adventures on the way the device also functioned as an ordinary calculator but only to a limited degree it could handle any calculation which returned an answer of anything up to it could manage and and or tan but anything above it represented merely as a suffusion of yellow dirk was not certain if this was a programming error or an insight beyond his ability to fathom but he was crazy about it anyway enough to hand over of ready cash for the thing thank you sir said the proprietor its a nice piece that i think youll be happy with it i ab said dirk glad to hear it sir replied the proprietor do you know youve broken your nose dirk looked up from fawning on his new possession yedth he said testily obf courth i dknow the man nodded satisfied just that a lot of my customers wouldnt always know about a thing like that he explained dirk thanked him tersely and humed out with his purchase a few minutes later he took up residence at the small comer table of an islington caf ordered a small but incredibly strong cup of coffee and attempted to take stock of his day a moments reflection told him that he was almost certainly going to need a small but incredibly strong beer as well and he attempted to add this to his order a wha said the waiter his hair was very black and filled with brilliantine he was tall incredibly fit and too cool to listen to customers or say consonants dirk repeated his order but what with having the caf s music system a broken nose and the waiters insuperable cool to contend with he eventually found it simpler to write out the order on a napkin with a stub of pencil the waiter peered at it in an offended manner and left dirk exchanged a friendly nod with the girl sitting half reading a book at the next table who had watched this exchange with sympathy then he set about laying out his mornings acquisitions on the table in front of him the newspaper the electronic i ching calculator and the envelope which he had retrieved from behind the gold disc on geoffrey ansteys bathroom wall he then spent a minute or two dabbing at his nose with a handkerchief and prodding it tenderly to see how much it hurt which turned out to be quite a lot he sighed and stuffed the handkerchief back in his pocket a few seconds later the waiter returned bearing a herb omelette and a single breadstick dirk explained that this wasnt what he had ordered the waiter shrugged and said that it wasnt his fault dirk had no idea what to say to this and said so he was still having a great deal of difficulty speaking the waiter asked dirk if he knew that he had broken his nose and dirk said that yedth dthagg you berry budge he did the waiter said that his friend neil had once broken his nose and dirk said that he hobed it hurd like hell which seemed to draw the conversation to a close the waiter took the omelette and left vowing never to return when the girl sitting at the next table looked away for a moment dirk leaned over and took her coffee he knew that he was perfectly safe doing this because she would simply not be able to believe that this had happened he sat sipping at the lukewarm cup and casting his mind back over the day he knew that before consulting the i ching even an electronic one he should try and compose his thoughts and allow them to settle calmly this was a tough one however much he tried to clear his mind and think in a calm and collected way he was unable to stop geoffrey ansteys head revolving incessantly in his mind it revolved disapprovingly as if pointing an accusing finger at dirk the fact that it did not have an accusing finger with which to point only served to drive the point it was trying to make home all the harder dirk screwed up his eyes and attempted to concentrate instead on the problem of the mysteriously vanished miss pearce but was unable to get much of a grip on it when she had used to work for him she would often disappear mysteriously for two or three days at a time but the papers didnt make any kind of fuss about it then admittedly there werent things exploding around her at the time at least not that he was aware of she had never mentioned anything exploding particularly furthermore whenever he thought of her face which he had last seen on the television set in geoffrey ansteys house his thoughts tended instantly to sink towards the head which was busy revolving thirtythree and a third times a minute three floors beneath it this was not conducive to the calm and contemplative mood he was seeking nor was the very loud music on the caf s music system he sighed and staied at the electronic i ching calculator if he wanted to get his thoughts into some kind of order then maybe chronological order would be as good a one as any he decided to cast his mind back to the beginning of the day before any of these appalling things had happened or at least before theyd happened to him first there had been the fridge it seemed to him that by comparison with everything else the problem of what to do about his fridge had now shrunk to fairly manageable proportions it still provoked a discemible twinge of fear and guilt but here he thought was a problem which he could face up to with relative calm the little book of instructions suggested that he should simply concentrate soulfully on the question which was besieging him write it down ponder on it enjoy the silence and then once he had achieved inner harmony and tranquillity he should push the red button there wasnt a red button but there was a blue button marked red and this dirk took to be the one he concentrated for a while on the question then looked through his pockets for a piece of paper but was unable to find one in the end he wrote his question should i buy a new fridge on a corner of his napkin then he took the view that if he was going to wait until he had achieved inner harmony and tranquillity he could be there all night so he went ahead and pushed the blue button marked red anyway a symbol flashed up in a corner of the screen a hexagram which looked like this chun the i ching calculator then scrolled this text across its tiny lcd display the judgement of king wen chun signifies difficulties at outset as of blade of grass pushing up against stone the time is full of irregularities and obscurities superior man will adjust his measures as in sorting the threads of the warp and woof firm correctness will bring at last success early advances should only be made with caution there will be advantage in appointing feudal princes line changes the commentary of the duke of chou the horses and the chariot obliged to retreat streams of bloody tears will flow dirk considered this for a few moments and then decided that on balance it appeared to be a vote in favour of getting the new fridge which by a staggering coincidence was the course of action which he himself favoured there was a pay phone in one of the dark corners where waiters slouched moodily at one another dirk threaded his way through them wondering whom it was they reminded him of and eventually deciding that it was the small crowd of naked men standing around behind the holy family in michelangelos picture of the same name for no more apparent reason than that michelangelo rather liked them he telephoned an acquaintance of his called nobby paxton or so he claimed who worked the darker side of the domestic appliance supply business dirk came straight to the point dobby i deed a fridge dirk i been saving one against the day youd ask me dirk found this highly unlikely only i wand a good fridge you thee dobby this is the best dirk japanese microprocessor controlled what would a microprothethor be doing id a fridge dobby keeping itself cool dirk ill get the lads to bring it round right away i need to get it off the premises pretty sharpish for reasons which i wont trouble you with i apprethiade thid dobby said dirk froblem id im not at home at preddent gaining access to houses in the absence of their owner is only one of the panoply of skills with which my lads are blessed let me know if you find anything missing afterwards by the way id be happy to dobby id fact if your ladth are in a mood for carting thtuff off id be glad if they would thtart with my old fridge it badly needth throwing away i shall see that its done dirk theres usually a skip or two on your street these days now do you expect to be paying for this or shall i just get you kneecapped straight off save everybody time and aggravation all round it was never one hundred per cent clear to dirk exactly when nobby was joking and he was not keen to put it to the test he assured him that he would pay him as soon as next they met see you very soon then dirk said nobby by the way do you know you sound exactly as if someones broken your nose there was a pause you there dirk said nobby yed said dirk i wad judd liddening to a reggord hot potato roared the hifi in the caf dont pick it up pick it up pick it up quick pass it on pass it on pass it on i said do you know you sound exactly as if someones broken your nose repeated nobby dirk said that he did know this thanked nobby for pointing it out said goodbye stood thoughtfully for a moment made another quick couple of phone calls and then threaded his way back through the huddle of posing waiters to find the girl whose coffee he had appropriated sitting at his table hello she said meaningfully dirk was as gracious as he knew how he bowed to her very politely doffed his hat since all this gave him a second or so to recover himself and requested her permission to sit down go ahead she said its your table she gestured magnanimously she was small her hair was neat and dark she was in her midtwenties and was looking quizzically at the halfempty cup of coffee in the middle of the table dirk sat down opposite her and leant forward conspiratorially i expeg he said in a low voice you are enquirigg after your coffee you betcha said the girl id very bad for you you dow is it id id caffeide cholethderog in the milgg i see so it was just my health you were thinking of i was thiggigg of meddy thiggs said dirk airily you saw me sitting at the next table and you thought theres a nicelooking girl with her health in ruins let me save her from herself in a nudthell do you know youve broken your nose yeth of courth i do said dirk crossly everybody keepth how long ago did you break it the girl asked id wad broked for me said dirk aboud tweddy middidd ago i thought so said the girl close your eyes for a moment dirk looked at her suspiciously why its all right she said with a smile im not going to hurt you now close them with a puzzled frown dirk closed his eyes just for a moment in that moment the girl reached over and gripped him firmly by the nose giving it a sharp twist dirk nearly exploded with pain and howled so loudly that he almost attracted the attention of a waiter you widge he yelled staggering wildly back from the table clutching his face you doubledabbed widge oh be quiet and sit down she said all right i lied about it not going to hurt you but at least it should be straight now which will save you a lot worse later on you should get straight round to a hospital to have some splints and padding put on im a nurse i know what im doing or at least i think i do lets have a look at you panting and spluttering dirk sat down once more his hands cupped round his nose after a few long seconds he began to prod it tenderly again and then let the girl examine it she said my names sally mills by the way i usually try to introduce myself properly before physical intimacy takes place but sometimes she sighed there just isnt time dirk ran his fingers up either side of his nose again i thigg id id trader dirk said at last straighter sally said say straighter properly itll help you feel better straighter said dirk yed i thee wad you mead what i see what you mead good she said with a sigh of relief im glad that worked my horoscope this morning said that virtually everything i decided today would be wrong yes well you dont want to believe all that rubbish said dirk sharply i dont said satly particularly not the great zaganza oh you read it too did you no that is well not for the same reason my reason was that a patient asked me to read his horoscope to him this morning just before he died what was yours er a very complicated one i see said sally sceptically whats this its a calculator said dirk well look i mustnt keep you i am indebted to you my dear lady for the tenderness of your ministrations and the loan of your coffee but lo the day wears on and i am sure you have a heavy schedule of grievous bodily harm to attend to not at all i came off night duty at nine oclock this morning and all i have to do all day is keep awake so that i can sleep normally tonight i have nothing better to do than to sit arnund talking to strangers in caf s you on the other hand should get yourself to a casualty department as soon as possible as soon as youve paid my bill in fact she leant over to the table she had originally been sitting at and picked up the runningtotal lying by her plate she looked at it shaking her head disapprovingly five cups of coffee im afraid it was a long night on the wards all sorts of comings and goings in the middle of it one patient in a coma who had to be moved to a private hospital in the early hours god knows why it had to be done at that time of night just creates unnecessary trouble i wouldnt pay for the second croissant if i were you i ordered it but it never came she pushed the bill across to dirk who picked it up with a reluctant sigh inordinate he said larcenously inordinate and in the circumstances adding a per cent service charge is tantamount to jeering at you i bet they wont even bring me a knife he turned and tried without any real hope of success to summon any of the gaggle of waiters lounging among the sugar bowls at the back sally mills took her bill and dirks and attempted to add them up on dirks calculator the total seems to come to a suffusion of yeliow she said thank you ill take that said dirk turning bask crossly and relieving her of the electronic i ching set which he put into his pocket he resumed his hapless waving at the tableau of waiters what do you want a knife for anyway asked sally to open this said dirk waggling the large heavily sellotaped envelope at her ill get you one she said a young man sitting on his own at another nearby table was looking away at that moment so sally quickly leaned across and nabbed his knife i am indebted to you said dirk and put out his hand to take the knife from her she held it away from him whats in the envelope she said you are an extremely inquisitive and presumptuous young lady exclaimed dirk and you said sally mills are very strange only said dirk as strange as i need to be humph said sally whats in the envelope she still wouldnt give him the knife the envelope is not yours proclaimed dirk and its contents are not your concern it looks very interesting though whats in it well i wont know till ive opened it she looked at him suspiciously then snatched the envelope from him i insist that you expostulated dirk incompletely whats your name demanded sally my name is gently mr dirk gently and not geoffrey anstey or any of these other names that have been crossed out she frowned briefly looking at them no said dirk certainly not so you mean the envelope is not yours either i that is aha so you are also being extremely what was it inquisitive and presumptuous i do not deny it but i am a private detective i am paid to be inquisitive and presumptuous not as often or copiously as i would wish but i am nevertheless inquisitive and presumptuous on a professional basis how sad i think its much more fun being inquisitive and presumptuous as a hobby so you are a professional while i am merely an amateur of olympic standard you dont look like a private detective no private detective looks like a private detective thats one of the first rules of private detection but if no private detective looks like a private detective how does a private detective know what it is hes supposed not to look like seems to me theres a problem there yes but its not one that keeps me awake at nights said dirk in exasperation anyway i am not as other private detectives my methods are holistic and in a very proper sense of the word chaotic i operate by investigating the fundamental interconnectedness of all things sally mills merely blinked at him every particle in the universe continued dirk warming to his subject and beginning to stare a bit affects every other particle however faintly or obliquely everything interconnects with everything the beating of a butterflys wings in china can affect the course of an atlantic hurricane if i could interrogate this tableleg in a way that made sense to me or to the tableleg then it could provide me with the answer to any question about the universe i could ask anybody i liked chosen entirely by chance any random question i cared to think of and their answer or lack of it would in some way bear upon the problem to which i am seeking a solution it is only a question of knowing how to interpret it even you whom i have met entirely by chance probably know things that are vital to my investigation if only i knew what to ask you which i dont and if only i could be bothered to which i cant he paused and said please will you let me have the envelope and the knife you make it sound as if someones life depends on it dirk dropped his eyes for a moment i rather think somebodys life did depend on it he said he said it in such a way that a cloud seemed to pass briefly over them sally mills relented and passed the envelope and the knife over to dirk a spark seemed to go out of her the knife was too blunt and the sellotape too thickly applied dirk struggled with it for a few seconds but was unable to slice through it he sat back in his seat feeling tired and irritable he said ill go and ask them if theyve got anything sharper and stood up clutching the envelope you should go and get your nose fixed said sally mills quietly thank you said dirk and bowed very slightly to her he picked up the bills and set out to visit the exhibition of waiters mounted at the rear of the cafe he encountered a certain coolness when he was disinclined to augment the mandatory per cent service charge with any voluntary additional token of his personal appreciation and was told that no that was the only type of knife they had and thats all there was to it dirk thanked them and walked back through the caf sitting in his seat talking to sally mills was the young man whose knife she had purloined he nodded to her but she was deeply engrossed in conversation with her new friend and did not notice in a coma she was saying who had to be moved to a private hospital in the early hours god knows why it had to be done at that time of night just creates unnecessary trouble excuse me rabbiting on but the patient had his own personal cocacola machine and sledgehammer with him and that sort of thing isall very well in a private hospital but on a shortstaffed nhs ward it just makes me tired and i talk too much when im tired if i suddenly fall insensible to the floor would you let me know dirk walked on and then noticed that sally mills had left the book she had been reading on her original table and something about it caught his attention it was a large book called run like the devil in fact it was extremely large and a little dogeared looking more like a puff pastry cliff than a book the bottom half of the cover featured the normal womanincocktaildressframedinthesightsofagun while the top half was entirely taken up with the authors name howard bell embossed in silver dirk couldnt immediately work out what it was about the book that had caught his eye but he knew that some detail of the cover had struck a chord with him somewhere he gave a circumspect glance at the girl whose coffee he had purloined and whose five coffees and two croissants one undelivered and uneaten he had subsequently paid for she wasnt looking so he purloined her book as well and slipped it into the pocket of his leather coat he stepped out on to the street where a passing eagle swooped out of the sky at him nearly forcing him into the path of a cyclist who cursed and swore at him from a moral high ground that cyclists alone seem able to inhabit chapter into the wellkempt grounds that lay just on the owtskins of a wellkempt village on the fringes of the wellkempt cotswolds turned a less than wellkempt car it was a battered yellow citro n cv which had had one careful owner but also three suicidally reckless ones it made its way up the driveway with a reluctant air as if all it asked for from life was to be tipped into a restful ditch in one of the adjoining meadows and there allowed to settle in graceful abandonment instead of which here it was being asked to drag itself all the way up this long gravelled drive which it would no doubt soon be called upon to drag itself all the way back down again to what possible purpose it was beyond its wit to imagine it drew to a halt in front of the elegant stone entrance to the main building and then began to trundle slowly backwards again until its occupant yanked on the handbrake which evoked from the car a sort of strangled eek a door flopped open wobbling perilously on its one remaining hinge and there emerged from the car a pair of the sort of legs which soundtrack editors are unable to see without needing to slap a smoky saxophone solo all over for reasons which no one besides soundtrack editors has ever been able to understand in this particular case however the saxophone would have been silenced by the proximity of the kazoo which the same soundtrack editor would almost certainly have slapped all over the progress of the vehicle the owner of the legs followed them in the usual manner closed the car door tenderly and then made her way into the building the car remained parked in front of it after a few minutes a porter came out and examined it adopted a disapproving manner and then for lack of anything more positive to do went back in a short time later kate was shown into the office of mr ralph standish the chief consultant psychologist and one of the directors of the woodshead hospital who was just completing a telephone conversation yes it is true he was saying that sometimes unusually intelligent and sensitive children can appear to be stupid but mrs benson stupid children can sometimes appear to be stupid as well i think thats something you might have to consider i know its very painful yes good day mrs benson he put the phone away into a desk drawer and spent a couple of seconds collecting his thoughts before looking up this is very short notice miss er schechter he said to her at last in fact what he had said was this is ve short notice miss er and then he had paused and peered into another of his desk drawers before saying schechter it seemed to kate that it was very odd to keep your visitors names in a drawer but then he clearly disliked having things cluttering up his fine but severely designed black ash desk because there was nothing on it at all it was completely blank as was every other surface in his office there was nothing on the small neat steel and glass coffee table which sat squarely between two barcelona chairs there was nothing on top of the two expensivelooking filing cabinets which stood at the back of the room there were no bookshelves if there were any books they were presumably hidden away behind the white doors of the large blank builtin cupboards and although there was one plain black picture frame hanging on the wall this was presumably a temporary aberration because there was no picture in it kate looked around her with a bemused air do you have no ornaments in here at all mr standish she asked he was for a moment somewhat taken aback by her transatlantic directness but then answered her indeed i have ornaments he said and pulled open another drawer he pulled out from this a small china model of a kitten playing with a ball of wool and put it firmly on the desk in front of him as a psychologist i am aware of the important role that ornamentation plays in nourishing the human spirit he pronounced he put the china kitten back in the drawer and slid it closed with a smooth click now he clasped his hands together on the desk in front of him and looked at her enquiringly its very good of you to see me at short notice mr standish yes yes weve established that but im sure you know what newspaper deadlines are like i know at least as much as i would ever care to know about newspapers miss er he opened his drawer again miss schechter but well thats partly what made me approach you lied kate charmingly i know that you have suffered from some well unfortunate publicity here and thought you might welcome the opportunity to talk about some of the more enlightening aspects of the work at the woodshead hospital she smiled very sweetly its only because you come to me with the highest recommendation from my very good friend and colleague mr er franklin alan franklin prompted kate to save the psychologist from having to open his drawer again alan franklin was a therapist whom kate had seen for a few sessions after the loss of her husband luke he had warned her that standish though brilliant was also peculiar even by the high standards set by his profession franklin resumed standish that i agreed to see you let me warn you instantly that if i see any resumption of this something nasty in the woodshead mendacity appearing in the papers as a result of this interview i will i will do such things what they are yet i know not but they shall be the terror of the earth said kate brightly standish narrowed his eyes lear act scene he said and i think youll find its terrors and not terror do you know i think youre right replied kate thank you alan she thought she smiled at standish who relaxed into pleased superiority it was odd kate reflected that people who needed to bully you were the easiest to push around so you would like to know precisely what miss schechter assume said kate that i know nothing standish smiled as if to signify that no assumption could possibly give him greater pleasure very well he said the woodshead is a research hospital we specialise in the care and study of patients with unusual or previously unknown conditions largely in the psychological or psychiatric fields funds are raised in various ways one of our chief methods is quite simply to take in private patients at exorbitantly high fees which they are happy to pay or at least happy to complain about there is in fact nothing to complain about because patients who come to us privately are made fully aware of why our fees are so high for the money they are paying they are of course perfectly entitled to complain the right to complain is one of the privileges they are paying for in some cases we come to a special arrangement under which in return for being made the sole beneficiaries of a patients estate we will guarantee to look after that patient for the rest of his or her life so in effect you are in the business of giving scholarships to people with particularly gifted diseases exactly a very good way of expressing it we are in the business of giving scholarships to people with particularly gifted diseases i must make a note of that miss mayhew he had opened a drawer which clearly contained his office intercom in response to his summons one of the cupboards opened and tumed out to be a door into a side office a feature which must have appealed to some architect who had conceived an ideological dislike of doors from this office there emerged obediently a thin and rather blankfaced woman in her midforties miss mayhew said mr standish we are in the business of giving scholarships to people with particularly gifted diseases very good mr standish said miss mayhew and retreated backwards into her office pulling the door closed after her kate wondered if it was perhaps a cupboard after all and we do have some patients with some really quite outstanding diseases at the moment enthused the psychologist perhaps you would care to come and see one or two of our current stars indeed i would that would be most interesting mr standish youre very kind said kate you have to be kind in this job standish replied and flicked a smile on and off at her kate was trying to keep some of the impatience she was feeling out of her manner she did not take to mr standish and was beginning to feel that there was a kind of martian quality to him furthermore the only thing she was actually interested in was discovering whether or not the hospital had accepted a new admission in the early hours of the morning and if so where he was and whether she could see him she had originally tried the direct approach but had been rebuffed by a mere telephone receptionist on the grounds that she didnt have a name to ask for simply asking if they had any tall wellbuilt blond men in residence had seemed to create entirely the wrong impression at least she insisted to herself that it was entirely the wrong impression a quick phone call to alan franklin had set her up for this altogether more subtle approach good a look of doubt passed momentarily over mr standishs face and he summoned miss mayhew from out of her cupboard again miss mayhew that last thing i just said to you yes mr standish i assume you realised that i wished you to make a note of it for me no mr standish but i will be happy to do so thank you said mr standish with a slightly tense look and tidy up in here please the place looks a he wanted to say that the place looked a mess but was frustrated by its air of clinical sterility just tidy up generally he concluded yes mr standish the psychologist nodded tersely brushed a nonexistent speck of dust off the top of his desk flicked another brief smile on and off at kate and then escorted her out of his office into the corridor which was immaculately laid with the sort of beige carpet which gave everyone who walked on it electric shocks here you see said standish indicating part of the wall they were walking past with an idle wave of his hand but not making it in any way clear what it was he wished her to see or what she was supposed to understand from it and this he said apparently pointing at a door hinge ah he added as the door swung open towards them kate was alarmed to find herself giving a little expectant start every time a door opened anywhere in this place this was not the sort of behaviour she expected of a worldlywise new yorker journalist even if she didnt actually live in new york and only wrote travel articles for magazines it still was not right for her to be looking for large blond men every time a door opened there was no large blond man there was instead a small sandyhaired girl of about ten years old being pushed along in a wheelchair she seemed very pale sick and withdrawn and was murmuring something soundlessly to herself whatever it was she was murmuring seemed to cause her worry and agitation and she would flop this way then that in her chair as if trying to escape from the words coming out of her mouth kate was instantly moved by the sight of her and on an impulse asked the nurse who was pushing her along to stop she squatted down to look kindly into the girls face which seemed to please the nurse a little but mr standish less so kate did not try to demand the girls attention merely gave her an open and friendly smile to see if she wanted to respond but the girl seemed unwilling or unable to her mouth worked away endlessly appearing almost to lead an existence that was independent of the rest of her face now that kate looked at her more closely it seemed that she looked not so much sick and withdrawn as weary harassed and unutterably fed up she needed a little rest she needed peace but her mouth kept motoring on for a fleeting instant her eyes caught kates and the message kate received was along the lines of im sorry but youll just have to excuse me while all this is going on the girl took a deep breath halfclosed her eyes in resignation and continued her relentless silent murmuring kate leant forward a little in an attempt to catch any actual words but she couldnt make anything out she shot an enquiring look up at standish he said simply stock market prices a look of amazement crept over kates face standish added with a wry shrug yesterdays im afraid kate flinched at having her reaction so wildly misinterpreted and hurriedly looked back at the girl in order to cover her confusion you mean she said rather redundantly shes just sitting here reciting yesterdays stock market prices the girl rolled her eyes past kates yes said standish it took a lip reader to work out what was going on we all got rather excited of course but then closer examination revealed that they were only yesterdays which was a bit of a disappointment not that significant a case really aberrant behaviour interesting to know why she does it but hold on a moment said kate trying to sound very interested rather than absolutely horrified are you saying that she is reciting what the closing prices over and over or no thats an interesting feature of course she pretty much keeps pace with movements in the market over the course of a whole day just twentyfour hours out of step but thats extraordinary isnt it oh yes quite a feat a feat well as a scientist i have to take the view that since the information is freely available she is acquiring it through normal channels theres no necessity in this case to invent any supernatural or paranonnal dimension occams razor shouldnt needlessly multiply entities but has anyone seen her studying the newspapers or copying stuff down over the phone she looked up at the nurse who shook her head dumbly no never actually caught her at it said standish as i said its quite a feat im sure a stage magician or memory man could tell you how it was done have you asked one no dont hold with such people but do you really think that she could possibly be doing this deliberately insisted kate believe me if you understood as much about people as i do miss er you would believe anything said standish in his most professionally reassuring tone of voice kate stared into the tired wretched face of the young girl and said nothing you have to understand said standish that we have to be rational about this if it was tomorrows stock market prices it would be a different story that would be a phenomenon of an entirely different character which would merit and demand the most rigorous study and im sure wed have no difficulty in funding the research there would be absolutely no problem about that i see said kate and meant it she stood up a little stiftly and brushed down her skirt so she said and felt ashamed of herself who is your newest patient who has arrived most recently then she shuddered at the crassness of the non sequitur but reminded herself that she was there as a journalist so it would not seem odd standish waved the nurse and the wheelchair with its sad charge on their way kate glanced back at the girl once and then followed standish through the swingdoors and into the next section of corridor which was identical to the previous one here you see said standish again this time apparently in relation to a window frame and this he said pointing at a light he had obviously either not heard her question or was deliberately ignoring it perhaps thought kate he was simply treating it with the contempt it deserved it suddenly dawned on her what all this here you see and and thising was about he was asking her to admire the quality of the decor the windows were sashes with finely made and beautifully painted beads the light fittings were of a heavy dull metal probably nickelplated and so on very fine she said accommodatingly and then noticed that this had sounded an odd thing to say in her american accent nice place youve got here she added thinking that that would please him it did he allowed himself a subdued beam of pleasure we like to think of it as a quality caring environment he said you must get a lot of people wanting to come here kate continued plugging away at her theme how often do you admit new patients when was the last with her left hand she carefully restrained her right hand which wanted to strangle her at this moment a door they were passing was slightly ajar and she tried unobtrusively to look in very well well take a look in here said standish immediately pushing the door fully open on what transpired to be quite a small room ah yes standish said recognising the occupant he ushered kate in the occupant of the room was another nonlarge nonblond person kate was beginning to find the whole visit to be something of an emotionally wearing experience and she had a feeling that things were not about to ease up in that respect the man sitting in the bedside chair while his bed was being made up by a hospital orderly was one of the most deeply and disturbingly tousled people that kate had ever seen in fact it was only his hair that was tousled but it was tousled to such an extreme degree that it seemed to draw all of his long face up into its distressed chaos he seemed quite content to sit where he was but there was something tremendously vacant about his contentedness he seemed literally to be content about nothing there was a completely empty space hanging in the air about eighteen inches in front of his face and his contentedness if it sprang from anything sprang from staring at that there was also a sense that he was waiting for something whether it was something that was about to happen at any moment or something that was going to happen later in the week or even something that was going to happen some little while after hell iced over and british telecom got the phones fixed was by no means apparent because it seemed to be all the same to him if it happened he was ready for it and if it didnt he was content kate found such contentedness almost unbearably distressing whats the matter with him she said quietly and then instantly realised that she was talking as if he wasnt there when he could probably speak perfectly well for himself indeed at that moment he suddenly did speak oh er hi he said ok yeah thank you er hello she said in response though it didnt seem quite to fit or rather what he had said didnt seem quite to fit standish made a gesture to her to discourage her from speaking er yeah a bagel would be fine said the contented man he said it in a flat kind of tone as if merely repeating something he had been given to say yeah and maybe some juice he added ok thanks he then relaxed into his state of empty watchfulness a very unusual condition said standish that is to say we can only believe that it is entirely unique ive certainly never heard of anything remotely like it it has also proved virtually impossible to verify beyond question that it is what it appears to be so im glad to say that we have been spared the embarrassment of attempting to give the condition a name would you like me to help mr elwes back to bed asked the orderly of standish standish nodded he didnt bother to waste words on minions the orderly bent down to talk to the patient mr elwes he said quietly mr elwes seemed to swim up out of a reverie mmmm he said and suddenly looked around he seemed confused oh oh what he said faintly would you like me to help you back to bed oh oh thank you yes yes that would be kind though clearly dazed and bewildered mr elwes was quite able to get himself back into bed and all the orderly needed to supply was reassurance and encouragement once mr elwes was well settled the orderly nodded politely to standish and kate and made his exit mr elwes quickly lapsed back into his trancelike state lying propped up against an escarpment of pillows his head dropped forward slightly and he stared at one of his knees poking up bonily from under the covers get me new york he said kate shot a puzzled glance at standish hoping for some kind of explanation but got none oh ok said mr elwes its something hold on he spoke another four digits of a number in his dead flat voice what is happening here asked kate at last it took us rather a long time to work it out it was only quite by the remotest chance that someone discovered it that television was on in the room he pointed to the small portable set off to one side of the bed tuned to one of those chat programme things which happened to be going out live most extraordinary thing mr elwes was sitting here muttering about how much he hated the bbc dont know if it was the bbc perhaps it was one of those other channels they have now and was expressing an opinion about the host of the programme to the effect that he considered him to be a rectum of some kind and saying furthermore that he wished the whole thing was over and that yes all right he was coming and then suddenly what he was saying and what was on the television began in some extraordinary way almost to synchronise i dont understand what you mean said kate id be surprised if you did said standish everything that elwes said was then said just a moment later on the television by a gentleman by the name of mr dustin hoffman it seems that mr elwes here knows everything that this mr hoffman is going to say just a second or so before he says it it is not i have to say something that mr hoffman would be very pleased about if he knew attempts have been made to alert the gentleman to the problem but he has proved to be somewhat difficult to reach just what the shit is going on here asked mr elwes placidly mr hoffman is we believe currently making a film on location somewhere on the west coast of america he looked at his watch i think he has probably just woken up in his hotel and is making his early morning phone calls he added kate was gazing with astonishment between standish and the extraordinary mr elwes how long has the poor man been like this oh about five years i think started absolutely out of the blue he was sitting having dinner with his family one day as usual when suddenly he started complaining about his caravan and then shortly afterwards about how he was being shot he then spent the entire night talking in his sleep repeating the same apparently meaningless phrases over and over again and also saying that he didnt think much of the way they were written it was a very trying time for his family as you can imagine living with such a perfectionist actor and not even realising it it now seems very surprising how long it took them to identify what was occurring particularly when he once woke them all up in the early hours of the morning to thank them and the producer and the director for his oscar kate who didnt realise that the day was still only softening her up for what was to come made the mistake of thinking that it had just reached a climax of shock the poor man she said in a hushed voice what a pathetic state to be in hes just living as someone elses shadow i dont think hes in any pain mr elwes appeared to be quietly locked in a bitter argument which seemed to touch on the definitions of the words points gross profits and limo but the implications of this are extraordinary arent they said kate hes actually saying these things moments before dustin hoffman well its all conjecture of course weve only got a few clear instances of absolute correlation and we just havent got the opportunity to do more thorough research one has to recognise that those few instances of direct correlation were not rigorously documented and could more simply be explained as coincidence the rest could be merely the product of an elaborate fantasy but if you put this case next to that of the girl we just saw ah well we cant do that you see we have to judge each case on its own merits but theyre both in the same world yes but there are separate issues obviously if mr elwes here could demonstrate significant precognition of for instance the head of the soviet union or better still the president of the united states then clearly there would be important defence issues involved and one might be prepared to stretch a point on the question of what is and what is not coincidence and fantasy but for a mere screen actor that is a screen actor with no apparent designs on political office i think that no we have to stick to the principles of rigorous science so he added turning to leave and drawing kate with him i think that in the cases of both mr elwes and er whatwashername the charming girl in the wheelchair it may be that we are not able to be of much more help to them and we may need the space and facilities for more deserving cases kate could think of nothing to say to this and followed seething dumbly ah now here we have an altogether much more interesting and promising case said standish forging on ahead through the next set of double doors kate was trying to keep her reactions under control but nevertheless even someone as glassy and martian as mr standish could not help but detect that his audience was not absolutely with him a little extra brusqueness and impatience crept into his demeanour to join forces with the large quantities of brusqueness and impatience which were already there they paced down the corridor for a few seconds in silence kate was looking for other ways of casually introducing the subject of recent admissions but was forced to concede to herself that you cannot attempt to introduce the same subject three times in a row without beginning to lose that vital quality of casualness she glanced as surreptitiously as she could at each door they passed but most were firmly closed and the ones that were not revealed nothing of interest she glanced out of a window as they walked past it and noticed a van turning into a roar courtyard it caught her attention in the brief instant that it was within her view because it very clearly wasnt a bakers van or a laundry van bakers vans and laundry vans advertise their business and have words like bakery and laundry painted on them whereas this van was completely blank it had absolutely nothing to say to anyone nnd it said it loudly and distinctly it was a large heavy seriouslooking van that was almost on the verge of being an actual lorry and it was painted in a uniform dark metallic grey it reminded kate of the huge gunmetalgrey freight lorries which thunder through bulgaria and yugoslavia on their way from albania with nothing but the word albania stencilled on their sides she remembered wondering what it was that the albanians exported in such an anonymous way but when on one occasion she had looked it up she found that their only export was electricity which if she remembered her high school physics correctly was unlikely to be moved around in lorries the large seriouslooking van turned and started to reverse towards a rear entrance to the hospital whatever it was that the van usually carried kate thought it was about either to pick it up or deliver it she moved on a few moments later standish arrived at a door knocked at it gently and looked enquiringly into the room within he then beckoned to kate to follow him in this was a room of an altogether different sort immediately within the door was an anteroom with a very large window through which the main room could be seen the two rooms were clearly soundproofed from each other because the anteroom was decked out with monitoring equipment and computers not one of which but didnt hum loudly to itself and the main room contained a woman lying in bed asleep mrs elspeth may said standish and clearly felt that he was introducing the top of the bill her room was obviously a very good one spacious and furnished comfortably and expensively fresh flowers stood on every surface and the bedside table on which mrs mays knitting lay was of mahogany she herself was a comfortably shaped silverhaired lady of late middle age and she was lying asleep half propped up in bed on a pile of pillows wearing a pink woolly cardigan aher a moment it became clear to kate that though she was asleep she was by no means inactive her head lay back peacefully with her eyes closed but her right hand was clutching a pen which was scribbling away furiously on a large pad of paper which lay beside her the hand like the wheelchair girls mouth seemed to lead an independent and feverishly busy existence some small pinkish electrodes were taped to mrs mays forehead just below her hairline and kate assumed that these were providing some of the readings which danced across the computer screens in the anteroom in which she and standish stood two whitecoated men and a woman sat monitoring the equipment and a nurse stood watching through the window standish exchanged a couple of brief words with them on the current state of the patient which was universally agreed to be excellent kate could not escape the impression that she ought to know who mrs may was but she didnt and was forced to ask she is a medium said standish a little crossly as i assumed you would know a medium of prodigious powers she is currently in a trance and engaged in automatic writing she is taking dictation virtually every piece of dictation she receives is of inestimable value you have not heard of her kate admitted that she had not well you are no doubt familiar with the lady who claimed that mozart beethoven and schubert were dictating music to her yes i did hear about that there was a lot of stuff in colour supplements about her a few years ago her claims were well interesting if thats the sort of thing youre interested in the music was certainly more consistent with what might be produced by each of those gentlemen quickly and before breakfast than it was with what you would expect from a musically unskilled middleaged housewife kate could not let this pomposity pass thats a rather sexist viewpoint she said george eliot was a middleaged housewife yes yes said standish testily but she wasnt taking musical dictation from the deceased wolfgang amadeus thats the point im making please try and follow the logic of this argument and do not introduce irrelevancies if i felt for a moment that the example of george eliot could shed any light on our present problem you could rely on me to introduce it myself where was i i dont know mabel doris was that her name let us call her mabel the point is that the easiest way of dealing with the doris problem was simply to ignore it nothing very important hinged on it at ali a few concerts second rate material but here here we have something of an altogether diffenent nature he said this last in hushed tones and turned to study a tv monitor which stood among the bank of computer screens it showed a closeup of mrs mays hand scuttling across her pad of paper her hand largely obscured what she had written but it appeared to be mathematics of some kind mrs may is or so she claims taking dictation from some of the greatest physicists from einstein and from heisenberg and planck and it is very hard to dispute her claims because the information being produced here by automatic writing by thisuntutored lady is in fact physics of a very profound order from the late einstein we are getting more and more refinements to our picture of how time and space work at a macroscopic level and from the late heisenberg and planck we are increasing our understanding of the fundamental structures of matter at a quantum level and there is absolutely no doubt that this information is edging us closer and closer towards the elusive goal of a grand unified field theory of everything now this produces a very interesting not to say somewhat embarrassing situation for scientists because the means by which the information is reaching us seems to be completely contrary to the meaning of the information its like uncle henry said kate suddenly standish looked at her blankly uncle henry thinks hes a chicken kate explained standish looked at her blankly again you must have heard it said kate were terribly worried about uncle henry he thinks hes a chicken well why dont you send him to the doctor well we would only we need the eggs standish stared at her as if a small but perfectly formed elderberry tree had suddenly sprung unbidden from the bridge of her nose say that again he said in a small shocked voice what all of it all of it kate stuck her fist on her hip and said it again doing the voices with a bit more dash and southern accents this time thats brilliant standish breathed when she had done you must have heard it before she said a little surprised by this response its an old joke no he said i have not we need the eggs we need the eggs we need the eggs we cant send him to the doctor because we need the eggs an astounding insight into the central paradoxes of the human condition and of our indefatigable facility for constructing adaptive rationales to account for it good god kate shrugged and you say this is a joke demanded standish incredulously yes its very old really and are they all like that i never realised well im astounded said standish utterly astounded i thought that jokes were things that fat people said on television and i never listened to them i feel that people have been keeping something from me nurse the nurse who had been keeping watch on mts may through the window jumped at being barked at unexpectedly like this er yes mr standish she said he clearly made her nervous why have you never told me any jokes the nurse stared at him and quivered at the impossibility of even knowing how to think about answering such a question er well make a note of it will you in future i will require you and all the other staff in this hospital to tell me all the jokes you have at your disposal is that understood er yes mr standish standish looked at her with doubt and suspicion you do know some jokes do you nurse he challenged her er yes mr standish i think yes i do tell me one what er now mr standish this instant er well um theres one which is that a patient wakes up after having well that is hes been to er to surgery and he wakes up and its not very good but anyway hes been to surgery and he says to the doctor when he wakes up doctor doctor whats wrong with me i cant feel my legs and the doctor says yes im afraid weve had to amputate both your arms and thats it really er thats why he couldnt feel his legs you see mr standish looked at her levelly for a moment or two youre on report nurse he said yes mr standish he turned to kate isnt there one about a chicken crossing a road or some such thing er yes said kate doubtfully she felt she was caught in a bit of a situation here and how does that go well said kate it goes why did the chicken cross the road yes and and the answer is to get to the other side i see standish considered things for a moment and what does this chicken do when it arrives at the other side of the road history does not relate replied kate promptly i think that falls outside the scope of the joke which really only concerns itself with the journey of the chicken across the road and the chickens reasons for making it its a little like a japanese haiku in that respect kate suddenly found she was enjoying herself she managed a surreptitious wink at the nurse who had no idea what to make of anything at all i see said standish once again and frowned and do these er jokes require the preparatory use of any form of artificial stimulant depends on the joke depends on who its being told to hmm well i must say youve certainly opened up a rich furrow for me miss er it seems to me that the whole field of humour could benefit from close and immediate scrutiny clearly we need to sort out the jokes which have any kind of genuine psychological value from those which merely encourage drug abuse and should be stopped good he turned to address the whitecoated nesearcher who was studying the tv monitor on which mrs mays scribblings were being tracked anything fresh of value from mr einstein he asked the researrher did not move his eyes from the screen he replied it says how would you like your eggs poached or boiled again standish paused interesting he said very interesting continue to make at careful note of everything she writes come this last he said to kate and made his way out of the room very strange people physicists he said as soon as they were outside again in my experience the ones who arent actually dead are in some way very ill well the afternoon presses on and im sure that you are keen to get away and write your article miss er i certainly have things urgently awaiting my attention and patients awaiting my care so if you have no more questions there is just one thing mr standish kate decided to hell with it we need to emphasise that its up to the minute perhaps if you could spare a couple more minutes we could go and see whoever is your most recent admission i think that would be a little tricky our last admission was about a month ago and she died of pneumonia two weeks after admission oh ah well perhaps that isnt so thrilling so no new admissions in the last couple of days no admissions of anyone particularly large or blond or nordic with a fur coat or a sledgehammer perhaps i mean just for instance an inspiration struck her a readmission perhaps standish regarded her with deepening suspicion miss er schechter miss schechter i begin to get the impression that your interests in the hospital are not he was interrupted at that moment by the swingdoors just behind them in the corridor being pushed open he looked up to see who it was and as he did so his manner changed he motioned kate sharply to stand aside while a large trolley bed was wheeled through the doors by an orderly a sister and another nurse followed in attendance and gave the impression that they were the entourage in a procession rather than merely nurses about their normal business the occupant of the trolley was a delicately frail old man with skin like finely veined parchment the rear section of the trolley was inclined upwards at a very slight angle so that the old man could survey the world as it passed him and he surveyed it with a kind of quiet benevolent horror his mouth hung gently open and his head lolled very slightly so that every slightest bump in the progress of the trolley caused it to roll a little to one side or the other yet in spite of his fragile listlessness the air he emanated was that of very quietly very gently owning everything it was the one eye which conveyed this each thing it rested on whether it was the view through a window or the nurse who was holding back the door so that the trolley could move through it without impediment or whether it was on mr standish who suddenly was all obsequious charm and obeisance all seemed instantly gathered up into the domain ruled by that eye kate wondered for a moment how it was that eyes conveyed such an immense amount of information about their owners they were after all merely spheres of white gristle they hardly changed as they got older apart from getting a bit redder and a bit runnier the iris opened and closed a bit but that was all where did all this flood of information come from particularly in the case of a man with only one of them and only a sealed up flap of skin in place of the other she was interrupted in this line of thought by the fact that at that instant the eye in question moved on from standish and settled on her the grip it exerted was so startling that she almost yelped with the frailest of faint motions the old man signalled to the orderly who was pushing the trolley to pause the trolley drew to a halt and when the noise of its rolling wheels was stilled there was for a moment no other noise to be heard other than the distant hum of an elevator then the elevator stopped kate returned his look with a little smiling frown as if to say sorry do i know you and then wondered to herself if in fact she did there was some fleeting familiarity about his face but she couldnt quite catch it she was impressed to notice that though this was only a trolley bed he was in the bed linen that his hands lay on was real linen freshly laundered and ironed mr standish coughed slightly and said miss er this is one of our most valued and er cherished patients mr are you quite comfortable mr odwin interrupted the sister helpfully but there was no need this was one patient whose name standish most certainly knew odin quieted her with the slightest of gestures mr odwin said standish this is miss er kate was about to introduce herself once more when she was suddenly taken completely by surprise i know exactly who she is said odin in a quiet but distinct voice and there was in his eye for a moment the sense of an aerosol looking meaningfully at a wasp she tried to be very formal and english im afraid she said stiffly that you have the advantage of me yes said odin he gestured to the orderly and together they resumed their leisurely passage down the corridor glances were exchanged between standish and the sister and then kate was startled to notice that there was someone else standing in the corridor there with them he had not presumably appeared there by magic he had merely stood still when the trolley moved on and his height or rather his lack of it was such that he had simply hitherto been hidden behind it things had been much better when he had been hidden there are some people you like immediately some whom you think you might learn to like in the fullness of time and some that you simply want to push away from you with a sharp stick it was instantly apparent into which category for kate the person of toe rag fell he grinned and stared at her or rather appeared to stare at some invisible fly darting round her head he ran up and before she could prevent him grabbed hold of her right hand in his and shook it wildly up and down i too have the advantage of you miss schechter he said and gleefully skipped away up the corridor chapter the large seriouslooking grey van moved smoothly down the driveway emerged through the stone gates and dipped sedately as it turned off the gravel and on to the asphalt of the public road the road was a windy country lane lined with the wintry silhouettes of leafless oaks and dead elms grey clouds were piled high as pillows in the sky the van made its stately progress away down the lane and soon was lost among its further twists and turns a few minutes later the yellow citro n made its less stately appearance between the gates it turned its splayed wheels up on to the camber of the lane and set off at a slow but difficult rate in the same direction kate was rattled the last few minutes had been rather unpleasant standish was clearly an oddly behaved man at the best of times but after their encounter with the patient named odwin he had turned unequivocally hostile it was the frightening hosulity of one who was himself frightened of what kate did not know who was she he had demanded to know how had she wheedled a refenence out of alan franklin a respected man in the profession what was she after what and this seemed to be the big one had she done to arouse the disapprobation of mr odwin she held the car grimly to the road as it negotiated the bends with considerable difficulty and the straight sections with only slightly less the car had landed her in court on one occasion when one of its front wheels had sailed off on a little expedition of its own and nearly caused an accident the police witness in court had referred to her beloved citro n as the alleged car and the name had subsequently stuck she was particularly fond of the alleged car for many reasons if one of its doors for instance fell off she could put it back on herself which is more than you could say for a bmw she wondered if she looked as pale and wan as she felt but the rearview mirror was rattling around under the seat so she was spared the knowledge standish himself had become quite white and shaky at the very idea of anybody crossing mr odwin and had dismissed out of hand kates attempts to deny that she knew anything of him at all if that were the case he had demanded of her why then had mr odwin made it perfectly clear that he knew her was she accusing mr odwin of being a liar if she was then she should have a care for herself kate did not know the encounter with mr odwin was completely inexplicable to her but she could not deny to herself that the man packed some kind of punch when he looked at you you stayed looked at but beneath the disturbing quality of his steady gaze had lain some even more disturbing undercurrents they were more disturbing because they were undercurrents of weakness and fear and as for the other creature clearly he was the cause of the stories that had arisen recently in the more extremely abhorrent sectors of the tabloid press about there being something nasty in the woodshead the stories had of course been offensive and callously insensitive and had largely been ignored by everybody in the country except for those very few millions who were keen on offensive and callously insensitive things the stories had claimed that people in the nrea had been terrorised by some repulsively deformed goblinlike creature who regularly broke out of the woodshead and committed an impressively wide range of unspeakable acts like most people kate had assumed insofar as she had thought about it at all that what had actually happened was that some poor bewildered mental patient had wandered out of the grounds and given a couple of passing old ladies a bit of a turn and that the slavering hacks of wapping had done the rest now she was a little more shaky and a little less sure he it had known her name what could she make of that what she made of it was a wrong turning in her preoccupation she missed the turning that would take her on to the main road back to london and then had to work out what to do about it she could simply do a threepoint turn and go back but it was a long time since she had last put the car into reverse gear and she was frankly a bit nervous about how it would take to it she tried taking the next two right turns to see if that would set her straight but she had no great hopes of this actually working and was right not to have she drove on for two or three miles knowing that she was on the wrong rmad but at least judging from the position of the lighter grey smear in the grey clouds going in the right direction after a while she settled down to this new route a couple of signposts she passed made it clear to her that she was merely taking the b route back to london now which she was perfectly happy to do if she had thought about it in advance she would probably have chosen to do so anyway in preference to the busy trunk road the trip had been a total failure and she would have done far better simply to have stayed soaking in the bath all afternoon the whole experience had been thoroughly disturbing verging on the frightening and she had drawn a complete blank as far as her actual objective was concemed it was bad enough having an objective that she could hardly bring herself to admit to without having it completely fall apart on her as well a sense of stale futility gradually closed in on her along with the general greyness of the sky she wondered if she was going very slightly mad her life seemed to have drifted completely out of her control in the last few days and it was distressing to realise just how fragile her grip was when it could so easily be shattered by a relatively minor thunderbolt or meteorite or whatever it was the word thunderbolt seemed to have arrived in the middle of that thought without warning and she didnt know what to make of it so she just let it lie there at the bottom of her mind like the towel lying on her bathroom floor that she hadnt been bothered to pick up she longed for some sun to break through the miles ground along under her wheels the clouds ground her down and she found herself increasingly thinking of penguins at last she felt she could stand it no more and decided that a few minutes walk was what she needed to shake her out of her mood she stopped the car at the side of the road and the elderly jaguar which had been following her for the last seventeen miles ran straight into the back of her which worked just as well chapter with a delicious shock of rage kate leapt invigorated out of her car and ran to harangue the driver of the other car who was in turn leaping out of his in order to harangue her why dont you look where youre going she yelled at him he was a rather overweight man who had been driving wearing a long leather coat and a rather ugly red hat despite the discomfort this obviously involved kate warmed to him for it why dont i look where irn going he replied heatedly dont you look in your nearview mirror no said kate putting her fists on her hips oh said her adversary why not because its under the seat i see he replied grimly thank you for being so frank with me do you have a lawyer yes i do as a matter of fact said kate she said it with vim and hauteur is he any good said the man in the hat im going to need one mines popped into prison for a while well you certainly cant have mine why not dont be absurd it would be a clear conflict of interest her adversary folded his arms and leant back against the bonnet of his car he took his time to survey the surroundings the lane was growing dim as the early winter evening began to settle on the land he then leant into his car to turn on his hazard warning indicators the rear amber lights winked prettily on the scrubby grass of the roadside the front lights were buried in the rear of kates citro n and were in no fit state to wink he resumed his leaning posture and looked kate up and down appraisingly you are a driver he said and i use the word in the loosest possible sense ie meaning merely somebody who occupies the driving seat of what i will for the moment call but i use the term strictly without prejudice a car while it is proceeding along the road of stupendous i would even say verging on the superhuman lack of skill do you catch my drift no i mean you do not drive well do you know youve been all over the road for the last seventeen miles seventeen miles exclaimed kate have you been following me only up to a point said dirk ive tried to stay on this side of the road i see well thank you in turn for being so frank with me this i need hardly tell you is an outrage youd better get yourself a damn good lawyer because mines going to stick redhot skewers in him perhaps i should get myself a kebab instead you look as if youve had quite enough kebabs may i ask you why you were following me you looked as if you knew where you were going to begin with at least for the first hundred yards or so what the hells it got to do with you where i was going navigational technique of mine kate narrowed her eyes she was about to demand a full and instant explanation of this preposterous remark when a passing white ford sierra slowed down beside them the driver wound down the window and leant out had a crash then he shouted at them yes ha he said and drove on a second or two later a peugeot stopped by them who was that just now the driver asked them in reference to the previous driver who had just stopped i dont know said dirk oh said the driver you look as if youve bad a crash of some sort yes said dirk thought so said the driver and drove on you dont get the same quality of passersby these days do you said dirk to kate you get hit by some real dogs too said kate i still want to know why you were following me you realise that its hard for me not to see you in the role of an extremely sinister sort of a person thats easily explained said dirk usually i am on this occasion however i simply got lost i was forced to take evasive action by a large grey oncoming van which took a proprietorial view of the road i only avoided it by nipping down a side lane in which i was then unable to reverse a few turnings later nnd i was thoroughly lost there is a school of thought which says that you should consult a map on these occasions but to such people i merely say ha what if you have no map to consult what if you have a map but its of the dordogne my own strategy is to find a car or the nearest equivalent which looks as if it knows where its going and follow it i rarely end up where i was intending to go but often i end up somewhere that i needed to be so what do you say to that piffle a robust response i salute you l was going to say that i do the same thing myself sometimes but ive decided not to admit that yet very wise said dirk you dont want to give away too much at this point play it enigmatic is my advice i dont want your advice where were you trying to get before suddenly deciding that driving seventeen miles in the opposite direction would help you get there a place called the woodshead ah the mental hospital you know it ive been driving away from it for the last seventeen miles and i wish it was further which ward will you be in i need to know where to send the repair bill they dont have wards said dirk and i think they would be distressed to hear you call it a mental hospital anything that distresses em is fine by me dirk looked about him a fine evening he said no it isnt i see said dirk you have if i may say so the air of one to whom her day has not been a source of joy or spiritual enrichment too damn right it hasnt said kate ive had the sort of day that would make st francis of assisi kick babies particularly if you include tuesday in with today which is the last time i was actually conscious and now look my beautiful car the only thing i can say in favour of the whole shebang is that at least im not in oslo i can see how that might cheer you i didnt say it cheered me it just about stops me killing myself i might as well save myself the bother anyway with people like you so keen to do it for me you were my able assistant miss schechter stop doing that stop doing what my name suddenly every stranger i meet knows my name would you guys please just quit knowing my name for one second how can a girl be enigmatic under these conditions the only person i met who didnt seem to know my name was the only one i actually introduced myself to all right she said pointing an accusing finger at dirk youre not supernatural so just tell me how you knew my name im not letting go of your tie till you tell me you havent got hold of i have now buster unhand me why were you following me insisted kate how do you know my name i was following you for exactly the reasons stated as for your name my dear lady you practically told me yourself i did not i assure you you did im still holding your tie if you are meant to be in oslo but have been unconscious since tuesday then presumably you were at the incredible exploding checkin counter at heathrow terminal two it was widely reported in the press i expect you missed it through being unconscious i myself missed it through rampant apathy but the events of today have rather forced it on my attention kate grudgingly let go of his tie but continued to eye him with suspicion oh yeah she said what events disturbing ones said dirk brushing himself down even if what you had told me yourself had not been eoough to identify you then the fact of your having also been today to visit the woodshead clinched it for me i gather from your mood of belligerent despondency that the man you were seeking was not thene what please have it said dirk rapidly pulling off his tie and handing it to her by chance i ran into a nurse from your hospital earlier today my first encounter with her was one which for various reasons i was anxious to terminate abruptly it was only while i was standing on the pavement a minute or two later fending off the local wildlife that one of the words i had heard her say struck me i may say somewhat like a thunderbolt the idea was fantastically wildly improbable but like most fantastically wildly improbable ideas it was at least as worthy of consideration as a more mundane one to which the facts had been strenuously bent to fit i returned to question her further and she confirmed that a somewhat unusual patient had in the early hours of the morning been transferred from the hospital apparently to the woodshead she also confided to me that another patient had been almost indecently curious to find out what had become of him that patient was a miss kate schechter and i think you will agree miss schechter that my methods of navigation have their advantages i may not have gone where i intended to go but i think i have ended up where i needed to be chapter after about half an hour a hefty man from the local garage arrived with a pickup truck a towrope and a son having looked at the situation he sent his son and the pickup truck away to deal with another job attached the towrope to kates now defunct car and pulled it away to the garage himself kate was a little quiet about this for a minute or two and then said he wouldnt have done that if i hadnt been an american he had recommended to them a small local pub where he would come and look for them when he had made his diagnosis on the citro n since dirks jaguar had only lost its front right indicator light and dirk insisted that he hardly ever turned right anyway they drove the short distance there as kate with some reluctance climbed into dirks car she found the howard bell book which dirk had purloined from sally mills in the caf and pounced on it a few minutes later walking into the pub she was still trying to work out if it was one she had nead or not the pub combined all the traditional english quatities of horse brasses formica and surliness the sound of michael jackson in the other bar mingled with the mournful intermittence of the glasscleaning machine in this one to create an aural ambience which perfectly matched the elderly paintwork in its dinginess dirk bought himself and kate a drink each and then joined her at the small comer table she had found away from the fat tshirted hostility of the bar i have read it she announced having thumbed her way by now through most of run like the devil at least i started it and read the first couple of chapters a couple of months ago in fact i dont know why i still read his books its pcrfectly clear that his editor doesnt she looked up at dirk i wouldnt have thought it was your sort of thing from what little i know of you it isnt said dirk i er picked it up by mistake thats what everyone says replied kate he used to be quite good she added if you liked that sort of thin my brothers in publishing in new york and he says howard bells gone very strange nowadays i get the feeling that theyre all a little afraid of him and he quite likes that certainly no one seems to have the guts to tell him he should cut chapters ten to twentyseven inclusive and all the stuff about the goat the theory is that the reason he sells so many millions of copies is that nobody ever does read them if everyone who bought them actually read them theyd never bother to buy the next one and his career would be over she pushed it away from her anyway she said youve very cleverly told me why i went to the woodshead you havent told me why you were going there yourself dirk shrugged to see what it was like he said noncommitally oh yes well ill save you the bother the place is quite horrible describe it in fact start with the airport kate took a hefty swig at her bloody mary and brooded silently for a moment while the vodka marched around inside her you want to hear about the airport as well she said at last yes kate drained the rest of her drink ill need another one then she said and pushed the empty glass across at him dirk braved the bugeyedness of the batman and returned a minute or two later with a refill for kate ok said kate ill start with the cat what cat the cat i needed to ask the nextdoor neighbour to look after for me which nextdoor neighbour the one that died i see said dirk tell you what why dont i just shut up and let you tell me yes said kate that would be good kate recounted the events of the last few days or at least those she was conscious for and then moved on to her impressions of the woodshead despite the distaste with which she described it it sounded to dirt like exactly the sort of place he would love to retire to if possible tomorrow it combined a dedication to the inexplicable which was his own persistent vice he could only think of it as such and sometimes would rail against it with the fury of an addict with a pampered selfindulgence which was a vice to which he would love to be able to aspire if he could ever but afford it at last kate related her disturbing encounter with mr odwin and his repellent minion and it was as a result of this that dirk remained sunk in a frowning silence for a minute afterwards a large part of this minute was in fact taken up with an internal struggle about whether or not he was going to cave in and have a cigarette he had recendy foresworn them and the struggle was a regular one and he lost it regularly often without noticing he decided with triumph that he would not have one and then took one out anyway fishing out his lighter from the capacious pocket of his coat involved first taking out the envelope he had removed from geoffrey aristeys bathroom he put it on the table next to the book and lit his cigarette the checkin girl at the airport he said at last she drove me mad said kate instantly she just went through the motions of doing her job like some kind of blank machine wouldnt listen wouldnt think i dont know where they find people like that she used to be my secretary in fact said dirk they dont seem to know where to find her now either oh im sorry said kate immediately and then reflected for a moment i expect youre going to say that she wasnt like that really she continued well thats possible i expect she was just shielding herself from the frustrations of her job it must drive you insensible working at an airport i think i would have sympathised if i hadnt been so goddamn frustated myself im sorry i didnt know so thats what youre trying to find out about dirk gave a noncommittal type of nod amongst other things he said then he added im a private detective oh said kate in surprise and then looked puzzled does that bother you its just that i have a friend who plays the double bass i see said dirk whenever people meet him and hes struggling arnund with it they all say the same thing and it drives him crazy they all say i bet you wished you played the piccolo nobody ever works out that thats what everybody else says i was just trying to work out if there was something that everybody would always say to a private detective so that i could avoid saying it no what happens is that everybody looks very shifty for a moment and you got that very well i see kate looked disappointed well do you have any clues that is to say any idea about whats happened to your secretary no said dirk no idea just a vague image that i dont know what to make of he toyed thoughtfully with his cigarette and then let his gaze wander over the table again and on to the book he picked it up and looked it over wondering what impulse had made him pick it up in the first place i dont really know anything about howard bell he said kate was surprised at the way he suddenly changed the subject but also a little relieved i only know said dirk that he sells a lot of books and that they all look pretty much like this what should i know well there are some very strange stories about him like what like what he gets up to in hotel suites all across america no one knows the details of course they just get the bills and pay them because they dont like to ask they feel theyre on safer ground if they dont know particularly about the chickens chickens said dirk what chickens well apparently said kate lowering her voice and leaning forward a little hes always having live chickens delivered to his hotel room dirk frowned what on earth for he said nobody knows nobody ever knows what happens to them nobody ever sees them again not she said leaning even further forward and dropping her voice still further a single feather dirk wondered if he was being hopelessly innocent and na ve so what do people think hes doing with them he asked nobody kate said has the faintest idea they dont even want to have the faintest idea they just dont know she shrugged and picked the book up again herself the other thing david thats my brother says about him is that he has the absolute perfect bestsellers name really said dirk in what way david says its the first thing any publisher looks for in a new author not is his stuff any good or is his stuff any good once you get rid of all the adjectives but is his last name nice and short and his first name just a bit longer you see the bell is done in huge silver letters and the howard fits neatly across the top in slightly narrower ones instant trade mark its publishing magic once youve got a name like that then whether you can actually write or not is a minor matter which in howard bells case is now a significant bonus but its a very ordinary name if you write it down in the normal way like it is here you see what said dirk here on this envelope of yours where let me see thats his name there isnt it crossed out good heavens youre right said dirk peering at the envelope i suppose i didnt recognise it without its trade mark shape is this something to do with him then asked kate picking it up and looking it over i dont know what it is exactly said dirk its something to do with a contract and it may be something to do with a record i can see it might be to do with a record how can you see that asked dirk sharply well this name here is dennis hutch isnt it see oh yes yes i do said dirk examining it for himself er should i know that name well said kate slowly it depends if youre alive or not i suppose hes the head of the aries rising record group less famous than the pope i grant you but you know of the pope i take it yes yes said dirk impatiently whitehaired chap thats him he seems to be about the only person of note this envelope hasnt been addressed to at some time heres stan dubcek the head of dubcek danton heidegger draycott i know they handle the arrgh account the arrgh aries rising record group holdings getting that account made the agencys fortunes she looked at dirk you have the air she stated of one who knows little of the record business or the advertising business i have that honour said dirk graciously inclining his head so what are you doing with this when i manage to get it open ill know said dirk do you have a knife on you kate shook her head whos geoffrey anstey then she asked hes the only name not crossed out friend of yours dirk paled a little and didnt immediately answer then he said this strange person you mentioned this something nasty in the woodshead creature tell me again what he said to you he said i too have the advantage of you miss schechter kate tried to shrug dirk weighed his thoughts uncertainly for a moment i think it is just possible he said at last that you may be in some kind of danger you mean its possible that passing lunatics may crash into me in the road that kind of danger maybe even worse oh yeah yes and what makes you think that its not entirely clear to me yet replied dirk with a frown most of the ideas i have at the moment have to do with things that are completely impossible so i am wary about sharing them they are however the only thoughts i have id get some different ones then said kate what was the sherlock holmes principle once you have discounted the impossible then whatever remains however improbable must be the truth i reject that entirely said dirk sharply the impossible often has a kind of integrity to it which the merely improbable lacks how often have you been presented with an apparently rational explanation of something which works in all respects other than one which is just that it is hopelessly improbable your instinct is to say yes but he or she simply wouldnt do that well it happened to me today in fact replied kate ah yes said dirk slapping the table and making the glasses jump your girl in the wheelchair a perfect example the idea that she is somehow receiving yesterdays stock market prices apparently out of thin air is merely impossible and therefore must be the case because the idea that she is maintaining an immensely complex and laborious hoax of no benefit to herself is hopelessly improbable the first idea merely supposes that there is something we dont know about and god knows there are enough of those the second however runs contrary to something fundamental and human which we do know about we should therefore be very suspicious of it and all its specious rationality but you wont tell me what you think no why not because it sounds ridiculous but i think you are in danger i think you might be in horrible danger great so what do you suggest i do about it said kate taking a sip of her second drink which otherwise had stayed almost untouched i suggest said dirk seriously that you come back to london and spend the night in my house kate hooted with laughter and then had to fish out a kleenex to wipe tomato juice off herself im sorry what is so extraordinary about that demanded dirk rather taken aback its just the most wonderfully perfunctory pickup line ive ever heard she smiled at him im afraid the answer is a resounding no he was she thought interesting entertaining in an eccentric kind of way but also hideously unattractive to her dirk felt very awkward i think there has been some appalling misunderstanding he said allow me to explain that he was interrupted by the sudden arrival in their midst of the mechanic from the garage with news of kates car fixed it he said in fact there were nothing to fix other than the bumper nothing new that is the funny noise you mentioned were just the engine but itll go all right you just have to rev her up let in the ctutch and then wait for a little bit longer than you might normally expect kate thanked him a little stiffly for this advice and then insisted on atlowing dirk to pay the he was charging for it outside in the car park dirk repeated his urgent request that kate should go with him but she was adamant that all she needed was a good nights sleep and that everything would look bright and clear and easily capable of being coped with in the morning dirk insisted that they should at least exchange phone numbers kate agreed to this on condition that dirk found another route back to london and didnt sit on her tail be very careful dirk called to her as her car grumbled out on to the road i will shouted kate and if anything impossible happens i promise youll be the first to know for a brief moment the yellow undulations of the car gleamed dully in the light leaking from the pub windows and stood out against the heavily hunched greyness of the night sky which soon swallowed it up dirk tried to follow her but his car wouldnt start chapter the clouds sank more heavily over the land clenching into huge sullen towers as dirk in a sudden excess of alarm had to call out the man from the garage once again he was slower to arrive with his truck this time and badtempered with drink when at last he did he emitted a few intemperate barks of laughter at dirks predicament then fumbled the bonnet of his car open and subjected him to all kinds of muttered talk about manifolds pumps alternators and starlings and resolutely would not be drawn on whether or not he was going to be able to get the thing to go again that night dirk was unable to get a meaningful answer or at least an answer that meant anything to him as to what was causing the rumpus in the alternator what ailed the fuel pump in what way the operation of the starter motor was being disrupted and why the timing was off he did at last understand that the mechanic was also claiming that a family of starlings had at some time in the past made their nest in a sensitive part of the engines workings and had subsequently perished horribly taking sensitive parts of the engine with them and at this point dirk began to cast about himself desperatety for what to do he noticed that the mechanics pickup truck was standing nearby with its engine still running and elected to make off with this instead being a slightly less slow and cumbersome runner than the mechanic he was able to put this plan into operation with a minimum of difficulty he swung out into the lane drove off into the night and parked three miles down the road he left the vans lights on let down its tyres and hid himself behind a tree after about ten minutes his jaguar came hurtling round the corner passed the van hauled itself to an abrupt halt and reversed wildly back towards it the mechanic threw open the door leapt out and hurried over to reclaim his property leaving dirk with the opportunity he needed to leap from behind the tree and reclaim his own he spun his wheels pointedly and drove off in a kind of grim triumph still haunted nevertheless by anxieties to which he was unableto give a name or shape kate in the meantime had joined the dimly glowing yellow stream that led on eventually through the westem suburbs of acton and ealing and into the heart of london she crawled up over the westway flyover and soon afterwards turned north up towards primrose hill and home she always enjoyed driving up alongside the park and the dark night shapes of the trees soothed her and made her long for the quietness of her bed she found the nearest parking space she could to her front door which was about thirty yards distant she climbed out of the car and carefully omitted to lock it she never left anything of value in it and she found that it was to her advantage if people didnt have to break anything in order to find that out the car had been stolen twice but on each occasion it had been found abandoned twenty yards away she didnt go straight home but set off instead in the opposite direction to get some milk and bin liners frmm the small corner shop in the next street she agreed with the gentlefaced pakistani who ran it that she did indeed look tired and should have an early night but on the way back she made another small diversion to go and lean against the railings of the park gaze into its darkness for a few minutes and breathe in some of its cold heavy night air at last she started to head back towards her flat she turned into her own road and as she passed the first street lamp it flickered and went out leaving her in a small pool of darkness that sort of thing always gives one a nasty turn it is said that there is nothing surprising about the notion of for instance a person suddenly thinking about someone they havent thought about for years and then discovering the next day that the person has in fact just died there are always lots of people suddenly remembering people they havent thought about for ages and always lots of people dying in a population the size of say america the law of averages means that this particular coincidence must happen at least ten times a day but it is none the less spooky to anyone who experiences it by the same token there are light bulbs burning out in street lamps all the time and a fair few of them must go pop just as someone is passing beneath them even so it still gives the person concerned a nasty tum especially when the very next street lamp they pass under does exactly the same thing kate stood rooted to the spot if one coincidence can occur she told herself then another coincidence can occur and if one coincidence happens to occur just after another coincidence then that is just a coincidence there was absolutely nothing to feel alarmed about in having a couple of street lamps go pop she was in a perfectly normal friendly street with houses all around her with their lights on she looked up at the house next to her unfortunately just as the lights in its front window chanced to go out this was presumably because the occupants happened to choose that moment to leave the room but though it just went to show what a truly extraordinary thing coincidence can be it did tittle to improve her state of mind the rest of the street was still bathed in a dim yellow glow it was only the few feet immediatety around her that were suddenly dark the next pool of light was just a few footsteps away in front of her she took a deep breath pulled herself together and walked towards it reaching its very centre at the exact instant that it too extinguished itself the occupants of the two houses she had passed on the way also happened to choose that moment to leave their front rooms as did their neighbours on the opposite side of the street perhaps a poputar television show had just finished thats what it was evervone was getting up and turning off their tv sets and lights simultaneously and the resulting power surge was blowing some of the street lamps something like that the resulting power surge was also making her blood pound a little she moved on trying to be calm as soon as she got home shed have a look in the paper to see what the programme had been that had caused three street lamps to blow four she stopped and stood absolutely stitl under the dark lamp more houses were darkening what she found particularty alarming was that they darkened at the very moment that she looked at them glance pop she tried it again glance pop each one she looked at darkened instantly glance pop she realised with a sudden start of fear that she must stop herself looking at the ones that were still lit the rationalisations she had been trying to construct were now running around inside her head screaming to be let out and she let them go she tried to lock her eyes to the ground for fear of extinguishing the whole street but couldnt help tiny glances to see if it was working glance pop she froze her gaze down on to the narrow path forward most of the road was dark now there were three remaining street lamps between her and the front door which led to her own flat though she kept her eyes averted she thought she could detect on the periphery of her vision that the lights of the flat downstairs from hers were lit neil lived there she couldnt remember his last name but he was a parttime bassplayer and antiques dealer who used to give her decorating advice she didnt want and also stole her milk so her relationship with him had always remained at a slightly frosty level just at the moment though she was praying that he was there to tell her what was wrong with her sofa and that his light would not go out as her eyes wavered from the pavement in front of her with its three remaining pools of light spaced evenly along the way she had to tread for a moment she tried turning and looked back the way she had come all was darkness shading off into the blackness of the park which no longer calmed but menaced her with hideously imagined thick knotted roots and treacherous dark rotting litter again she turned sweeping her eyes low three pools of light the street lights did not extinguish as she looked at them only as she passed she squeezed her eyes closed and visualised exactly where the lamp of the next street light was above and in front of her she raised her head and carefully opened her eyes again staring directly into the orange glow radiating through the thick glass it shone steadily with her eyes locked fast on it so that it burnt squiggles on her retina she moved cautiously forward step by step exerting her will on it to stay burning as she approached it continued to glow she stepped forward again it continued to glow again she stepped still it glowed now she was almost beneath it craning her neck to keep it in focus she moved forward once more and saw the filament within the glass flicker and quickly die away leaving an afterimage prancing madly in her eyes she dropped her eyes now and tried looking steadily forward but wild shapes were leaping everywhere and she felt she was losing control the next lamp she took a lunging run towards and again sudden darkness enveloped her arrival she stopped there panting and blinking trying to calm herself again and get her vision sorted out looking towards the last street lamp she thought she saw a figure standing beneath it it was a large form silhouetted with jumping orange shadows huge horns stood upon the figures head she stated with mad intensity into the billowing darkness and suddenly screamed at it who are you there was a pause and then a deep answering voice said do you have anything that can get these bits of floorboard off my back chapter there was another pause of a different and slightly disordered quality it was a long one lt hung there nervously wondering which direction it was going to get broken from the darkened street took on a withdrawn defensive aspect what kate screamed back at the figure at last i said what the great figure stirred kate still could not see him properly because her eyes were still dancing with blue shadows seared there by the orange light was said the figure glued to the floor my father did youare you kate quivered with incoherent rage are you responsiblefor all this she turned and swept an angry hand around the street to indicate the nightmare she had just traversed it is important that you know who i am oh yeah said kate well lets get the name down right now so i can take it straight to the police and get you done for breach of something wilful or other intimidation interfering with i am thor i am the god of thunder the god of rain the god of the high towering clouds the god of lightning the god of the flowing currents the god of the particles the god of the shaping and the binding forces the god of the wind the god of the growing crops the god of the hammer mjollnir are you simmered kate well ive no doubt that if youd picked a slack moment to mention all that i might have taken an interest but right now it just makes me very angry turn the damn lights on i am i said turn the lights on with something of a sheepish glow the streetlights all came back on and the windows of the houses all quietly illuminated themselves once more the lamp above kate popped again almost immediately she shot him a warning look it was an old light and infirm he said she simply continued to glare at him see he said i have your address he held out the piece of paper she had given him at the airport as if that somehow explained everything and put the world to rights i back he shouted throwing up his arms in front of his face what with a huge rush of wind a swooping eagle dropped from out of the night sky with its talons outspread to catch at him thor beat and thrashed at it until the great bird flailed backwards turned nearly crashed to the ground recovered itself and with great slow beats of its wings heaved itself back up through the air and perched on top of the street lamp it grasped the lamp hard with its talons and steadied itself making the whole lamppost quiver very slightly in its grip go shouted thor at it the eagle sat there and peered down at him a monstrous creature made more monstrous by the effect of the orange light on which it perched casting huge flapping shadows on the nearby houses it had strange circular markings on its wings these were markings that kate wondered if she had seen before only in a nightmare but then again she was by no means certain that she was not in a nightmare now there was no doubt that she had found the man she was looking for the same huge form the same glacial eyes the same look of arrogant exasperation and slight muddle only this time his feet were plunged into huge hide boots great furs straps and thongs hung from his shoulders a huge steel horned helmet stood on his head and his exasperation was directed this time not at an airline checkin girl but at a huge eagle perched on a lamppost in the middle of primrose hill go he shouted at it again the matter is beyond my power all that i can do i have done your family is provided for you i can do nothing more for i myself am powerless and sick kate was suddenly shocked to see that there were great gouges on the big mans left forearm where the eagle had got its talons into him and ripped them through his skin blood was welling up out of them like bread out of a baking tin go he shouted again with the edge of one hand he scraped the blood off his other arm and flung the heavy drops at the eagle which reared back flapping but retained its hold suddenly the man leapt high into the air and grappled himself to the top of the lamppost which now began to shake dangerously under their combined weight with loud cries the eagle pecked viciously at him while he tried with great swings of his free arm to sweep it from its perch a door opened it was the front door of kates house and a man with greyrimmed spectacles and a neat moustache looked out it was neil kates downstairs neighbour in a mood look i really think he started however it quickly became clear that he simply didnt know what to think and retreated back indoors taking his mood unsatisfied with him the big man braced himself and with a huge leap hurled himself through the air and landed with a slight controlled wobble on top of the next lamppost which bent slightly under his weight he crouched glaring at the eagle which glared back go he shouted again brandishing his arm at it gaarh it screeched back at him with another swing of his arm he pulled from under his furs a great shorthandled sledgehammer and hefted its great weight meaningfully from one hand to another the head of the hammer was a roughly cast piece of iron about the size and shape of a pint of beer in a big glass mug and its shaft was a stocky wristthick piece of ancient oak with leather strapping bound about its handle gaaaarrrh screeched the eagle again but regarded the sledgehammer with keeneyed suspicion as thor began slowly to swing the hammer the eagle shifted its weight tensely from one leg to the other in time to the rhythm of the swings go said thor again more quietly but with greater menace he rose to his full height on top of the lamppost and swung the hammer faster and faster in a great circle suddenly he hurled it directly towards the eagle in the same instant a bolt of high voltage electricity erupted from the lamp on which the eagle was sitting causing it to leap with loud cries wildly into the air the hammer sailed harmlessly under the lamp swung up into the air and out over the darkness of the park while thor released of its weight wobbled and tottered on top of his lamppost spun round and regained his balance flailing madly at the air with its huge wings the eagle too regained control of itself flew upwards made one last diving attack on thor which the god leapt backwards off the lamppost to avoid and then climbed up and away into the night sky in which it quickly became a small dark speck and then at last was gone the hammer came bounding back from out of the sky scraped flying sparks from the pavingstones with its head turned over twice in the air and then dropped its head back to the ground next to kate and nested its shaft gently against her leg an elderly lady who had been waiting patiently with her dog in the shadows beneath the street lamp which was now defunct sensed correctly that all of the excitement was now over and proceeded quietly past them thor waited politely till they had passed and then approached kate who stood with her arms folded watching him after all the business of the last two or three minutes he seemed suddenly not to have the faintest idea what to say and for the moment merely gazed thoughtfully into the middle distance kate formed the distinct impression that thinking was for him a separate activity from everything else a task that needed its own space it could not easily be combined with other activities such as walking or talking or buying airline tickets wed better take a look at your arm she said and led the way up the steps to her house he followed docile as she opened the front door she found neil in the hall leaning his back against the wall and looking with grim pointedness at a cocacola vending machine standing against the opposite wall and taking up an inordinate amount of space in the hallway i dont know what were going to do about this i really dont he said whats it doing there asked kate well thats what im asking you im afraid said neil i dont know how youre going to get it up the stairs dont see how it can be done to be perfectly frank with you and lets face it i dont think youre going to like it once youve got it up there i know its very modern and american but think about it youve got that nice french cherrywood table that sofa which will be very nice once youve taken off that dreadful collier campbell covering like i keep on saying you should only you wont listen and i just dont see that its going to fit in not in either sense and im not even sure that i should allow it i mean its a very heavy object and you know what ive said to you about the floors in this house id think again i really would you know yes neil how did it get here well your friend here delivered it just an hour or so ago i dont know where hes been working out but i must say i wouldnt mind paying his gym a visit i said i thought the whole thing was very doubtful but he would insist and in the end i even had to give him a hand but i must say that i think we need to have a very serious think about the whole topic i asked your friend if he liked wagner but he didnt respond very well so i dont know what do you want to do about it kate took a deep breath she suggested to her huge guest that he carry on upstairs and she would see him in just a moment thor lumbered past and was an absurd figure mounting the stairs neil watched kates eyes very closely for a clue as to what exactly was going on but kate was as blank as she knew how im sorry neil she said matteroffactly the coke machine will go its all a misunderstanding ill get this sorted out by tomorrow yes thats all very well said neil but where does all this leave me i mean you see my problem no neil i dont well ive got thisthing out here youve got thatperson upstairs and the whole thing is just a total disruption is there anything i can do to make anything any better well its not as easy as that is it i mean i think you should just think about it a bit thats all i mean all this you told me you were going away i heard the bath running this afternoon what was i to think and after you had gone on about the cat and you know i wont work with cats i know neil thats why i asked mrs grey next door to look after her yes and look what happened to her died of a heart attack mr greys very upset you know i dont think it had anything to do with me asking her if she would look after my cat well all i can say is that hes very upset yes neil his wifes died well im not saying anything im just saying i think you should think about it and what on earth are we going to do about all this he added readdressing his attention to the cocacola machine ive said that i will make sure its gone in the morning neil said kate im quite happy to stand here and scream very loudly if you think it will help in any way but listen love im only making the point and i hope youre not going to be making a lot of noise up there because ive got to practise my music tonight and you know that i need quiet to concentrate he gave kate a meaningful look over the top of his glasses and disappeared into his flat kate stood and silently counted as much of one to ten as she could currently remember and then headed staunchly up the stairs in the wake of the god of thunder feeling that she was not in a mood for either weather or theology the house began to throb and shake to the sound of the main theme of the ride of the valkyries being played on a fender precision bass chapter as dirk edged his way along the euston road caught in the middle of a rush hour traffic jam that had started in the late nineteen seventies and which at a quarter to ten on this thursday evening still showed no signs of abating he thought he caught sight of something he recognised it was his subconscious which told him this that infuriating part of a persons brain which never responds to interrogation merely gives little meaningful nudges and then sits humming quietly to itself saying nothing well of course ive just seen something i recognise dirk muttered mentally to his subconscious i drive along this benighted thoroughfare twenty times a month i expect i recognise every single matchstick lying in the gutter cant you be a little more specific his subconscious would not be hectored though and was dumb it had nothing further to add the city was probably full of grey vans anyway very unremarkable where muttered dirk to himself fiercely twisting round in his seat this way and that where did i see a grey van nothing he was thoroughly hemmed in by the traffic and could not manoeuvre in any direction least of all forward he erupted from his car and started to jostle his way back through the jammed cars bobbing up and down to try and see where if anywhere he might have caught a glimpse of a grey van if he had seen one it eluded him now his subconscious sat and said nothing the traffic was still not moving so he tried to thread his way further back but was obstructed by a large motorcycle courier edging his way forward on a huge grimy kawasaki dirk engaged in a brief altercation with the courier but lost it because the courier was unable to hear dirks side of the altercation eventually dirk retreated through the tide of traffic which now was beginning slowly to move in all lanes other than the one in which his car sat driverless immobile and hooted at he felt suddenly elated by the braying of the motor horns and as he swayed and bobbed his way back through the snarled up columns of cars he suddenly found that he reminded himself of the crazies he had seen on the streets of new york who would career out into the road to explain to the oncoming traffic about the day of judgement imminent alien invasions and incompetence and corruption in the pentagon he put his hands above his head and started to shout out the gods are walking the earth the gods are walking the earth this further inflamed the feelings of those who were beeping their horns at his stationary car and quickly the whole rose through a crescendo of majestic cacophony with dirks voice ringing out above it the gods are walking the earth the gods are walking the earth he hollered the gods are walking the earth thank you he added and ducked down into his car put it into drive and pulled away allowing the whole jammed mass at last to seethe easily forward he wondered why he was so sure an act of god merety a chance careless phrase by which people were able to dispose conveniently of awkward phenomena that would admit of no more rational explanation but it was the chance carelessness of it which particularly appealed to dirk because words used carelessly as if they did not matter in any serious way often allowed otherwise wellguarded truths to seep through ao inexplicable disappearance oslo and a hammer a tiny tiny coincidence which struck a tiny tiny note however it was a note which sang in the midst of the daily hubbub of white noise and other tiny notes were singing at the same pitch an act of god oslo and a hammer a man with a hammer trying to go to norway is prevented loses his temper and as a result there is an act of god if thought dirk if a being were immortal he would still be alive today that quite simply was what immortal meant how would an immortal being have a passport quite simpty how dirk tried to imagine what might happen if to pick a name quite at random the god thor he of the norwegian ancestry and the great hammer were to arrive at the passport office and try to explain who he was and how come he had no birth certificate there would be no shock no horror no loud exclamations of astonishment just blank bureaucratic impossibility it wouldnt be a matter of whether anybody believed him or not it would simply be a question of producing a valid birth certificate he coutd stand there wreaking miracles all day if he liked but at close of business if he didnt have a valid birth certificate he would simply be asked to leave and credit cards if to sustain for a moment the same arbitrary hypothesis the god thor were alive and for some reason at large in england then he would probably be the only person in the country who did not receive the constant barrage of invitations to apply for an american express card crude threats by the same post to take their american express cards away and gift catalogues full of sumptuously unpleasant things lavishly tooled in naff brown plastic dirk found the idea quite breathtaking that is if he were the only god at large which once you were to accept the first extravagant hypothesis was hardly likely to be the case but imagine for a moment such a person attempting to leave the country armed with no passport no credit cards merely the power to throw thunderbolts and who knew what else you would probably have to imagine a scene very similar to the one that did in fact occur at terminal two heathrow but why if you were a norse god would you be needing to leave the country by means of a scheduled airline surely there were other means dirk rather thought that one of the perks of being an immortal divine might be the ability to fly under your own power from what he remembered of his reading of the norse legends many years ago the gods were continually flying all over the place and there was never any mention of them hanging around in departure lounges eating crummy buns admittedly the world was not in those days bristling with airtraffic controllers radar missile warning systems and such like still a quick hop across the north sea shouldnt be that much of a problem for a god particularly if the weather was in your favour which if you were the god of thunder you would pretty much expect it to be or want to know the reason why should it another tiny note sang in the back of dirks mind and then was lost in the hubbub he wondered for a moment what it was like to be a whale physically he thought he was probably well placed to get some good insights though whales were better adapted for their lives of gliding about in the vast pelagic blueness than he was for his of struggling up through the pentonville road traffic in a weary old jaguar but what he was thinking of in fact was the whales songs in the past the whales had been able to sing to each other across whole oceans even from one ocean to another because sound travels such huge distances underwater but now again because of the way in which sound travels there is no part of the ocean that is not constantly jangling with the hubbub of ships motors through which it is now virtually impossible for the whales to hear each others songs or messages so fucking what is pretty much the way that people tend to view this problem and understandably so thought dirk after all who wants to hear a bunch of fat fish oh all right mammals burping at each other but for a moment dirk had a sense of infinite loss and sadness that somewhere amongst the frenzy of information noise that daily rattled the lives of men he thought he might have heard a few notes that denoted the movements of gods as he turned north into islington and began the long haul up past the pizza restaurants and estate agents he felt almost frantic at the idea of what their lives must now be like chapter thin fingers of lightning spread out across the heavy underside of the great clouds which hung from the sky like a sagging stomach a small crack of fretful thunder nagged at it and dragged from it a few mean drops of greasy drizzle beneath the sky ranged a vast assortment of wild turrets gnarled spires and pinnacles which prodded at it goaded and inflamed it till it seemed it would burst and drown them in a flood of festering horrors high in the flickering darkness silent figures stood guard behind long shields dragons crouched gaping at the foul sky as odin father of the gods of asgard approached the great iron portals through which led to his domain and on into the vaulted halls of valhalla the air was full of the noiseless howls of great winged dogs welcoming their master to the seat of his rule lightning searched among the towers and turrets the great ancient and immortal god of asgard was returning to the current site of his domain in a manner that would have surprised even him centuries ago in the years of the prime of his life for even the immortal gods have their primes when their powers are rampant and they both nourish and hold sway over the world of men the world whose needs give them birth he was returning in a large unmarked grey mercedes van the van drew to a halt in a secluded area the cab door opened and there climbed down from it a dull slowfaced man in an unmarked grey uniform he was a man who was charged with the work he did in life because he was not one to ask questions not so much on account of any natural quality of discretion as because he simply could never think of any questions to ask moving with a slow rolling gait like a paddle being pulled through porridge he made his way to the rear of the van and opened the rear doors an elaborate procedune involving the coordinated manipulation of many sliders and levers at length the doors swung open and if kate had been present she might for a moment have been jolted by the thought that perhaps the van was carrying albanian electricity after all a haze of light greeted hillow the mans name was hillow but nothing about this struck him as odd a haze of light was simply what he expected to see whenever he opened this door the first time ever he had opened it he had simply thought to himself oh a haze of light oh well and more or less ieft it at that on the strength of which he had guaranteed himself regular employment for as long as he cared to live the haze of light subsided and coalesced into the shape of an old old man in a trolley bed attended by a short little figure whom hiilow would probably have thought was the most evillooking person he had ever seen if he had had a mind to recall the other people he had seen in his life and run through them all one by one making the comparison that however was harder than hillow wished to work his only concern at present was to assist the small figure with the decanting of the old mans bed on to ground levei this was fluently achieved the legs and wheels of the bed were a miracle of smoothly operating stainless steel technology they unlocked rolled swivelled in elaborately interlocked movements which made the negotiating of steps or bumps all part of the same fluid gliding motion to the right of this area lay a large antechamber panelled in finely carved wood with great marble torch holders standing proudly from the walls this in turn led into the great vaulted hall itself to the left however lay the entrance to the majestic inner chambers where odin would go to prepare himself for the encounters of the night he hated all this hounded from his bed he muttered to himself though in truth he was bringing his bed with him made to listen once again to all kinds of self indulgent claptrap from his boneheaded thunderous son who would not accept could not accept simply did not have the intelligence to accept the new realities of life if he would not accept them then he must be extinguished and tonight asgard would see the extinction of an immortal god it was all thought odin fractiously too much for someone at his time of life which was extremely advanced but not in any particular direction he wanted merely to stay in his hospital which he loved the arrangement which had brought him to that place was of the sweetest kind and though it was not without its cost it was a cost that simply had to be borne and that was all there was to it there were new realities and he had learned to embrace them those who did not would simply have to suffer the consequences nothing came of nothing even for a god aher tonight he could return to his life in the woodshead indefinitely and that would be good he said as much to hillow clean white sheets he said to hillow who merely nodded blankly linen sheets every day clean sheets hillow manoeuvred the bed arnund and up a step being a god hillow continued odin being a god well it was unclean you hear what im saying there was no one who took care of the sheets i mean really took care of them would you think that in a situation like mine father of the gods there was no one absolutely no one who came in and said mr odwin he chuckled to himself they call me mr odwin there you know they dont quite know who theyre dealing with i dont think they could handle it do you hillow but there was no one in all that time who came in and said mr odwin i have changed your bed and you have clean sheets no one there was constant talk about hewing things and ravaging things and splitting things asunder lots of big talk of things being mighty and of things being riven and of things being in thrall to other things but very little attention given as i now realise to the laundry let me give you an example his reminiscences were for a moment interrupted however by the arrival of his vehicle at a great doorway which was guarded by a great sweaty splodge of a being who stood swaying arms akimbo in their path toe rag who had been preserving an intense silence as he stalked along just ahead of the bed hurried forward and had a quick word with the sweating creature who had to bend redfaced to hear him then instantly the sweaty creature shrank back with glistening obsequiousness into its yellow lair and the sacred trolley rolled forward into the great halls chambers and corridors from which great gusty echoes roared and fetid odours blew let me give you an example hillow continued odin take this place for example take valhalla chapter turning north was a manoeuvre which normally had the effect of restoring a sense of reason and sanity to things but dirk could not escape a sense of foreboding furthermore it came on to rain a little which should have helped but it was such mean and wretched rain to come from such a heavy sky that it only increased the sense of claustrophobia and frustration which gripped the night dirk turned on the car wipers which grumbled because they didnt have quite enough rain to wipe away so he turned them off again rain quickly speckled the windscreen he turned on the wipers again but they still refused to feel that the exercise was worthwhile and scraped and squeaked in protest the streets turned treacherously slippery dirk shook his head he was being quite absurd he told himself in the worst possible way he had allowed himself to become fanciful in a manner that he quite despised he astounded himself at the wild fantasies he had built on the flimsiest amount of well he would hardly call it evidence mere conjecture an accident at an airport probably a simple explanation a man with a hammer so what a grey van which kate schechter had seen at the hospital nothing unusual about that dirk had nearly collided with it but again that was a perfectly commonplace occurrence a cocacola machine he hadnt taken that into account where did a cocacola machine fit into these wild notions about ancient gods the only idea he had about that was simply too ridiculous for words and he refused even to acknowledge it to himself at that point dirk found himself driving past the house where that very moming he had encountered a client of his who had had his severed head placed on a revolving record turntable by a greeneyed devilfigure waving a scythe and a bloodsigned contract who had then vanished into thin air he peered at it as he passed and when a large darkblue bmw pulled out from the kerb just ahead of him he ran straight into the back of it and for the second time that day he had to leap out of his car already shouting for gods sake cant you look where youre going he exclaimed in the hope of bagging his adversarys best lines from the outset stupid people he continued without pausing for breath careering all over the place driving without due care and attention reckless assault confuse your enemy he thought lt was a little like phoning somebody up and saying yes hello in a testy voice when they answered which was one of dirks favourite methods of whiling away long hot summer afternoons he bent down and examined the palpable dent in the rear of the bmw which was quite obviously damn it a brand new one blast and bugger it thought dirk look what youve done to my bumper he cried i hope you have a good lawyer i am a good lawyer said a quiet voice which was followed by a quiet click dirk looked up in momentary apprehension the quiet click was only the sound of the car door closing the man was wearing an italian suit which was also quiet he had quiet glasses quietly cut hair and though a bowtie is not by its very nature a quiet object the particular bowtie he wore was nevertheless a very quietly spotted example of the genre he drew a slim wallet from his pocket and also a slim silver pencil he walked without fuss to the rear of dirks jaguar and made a note of the registration number do you have a card he enquired as he did so without looking up heres mine he added taking one from his wallet he made a note on the back of it my registration number he said and the name of my insurance company perhaps you would be good enough to let me have the name of yours if you dont have it with you ill got my girl to call you dirk sighed and decided there was no point in putting up a fight on this one he fished out his wallet and leafed through the various business cards that seemed to accumulate in it as if from nowhere he toyed for a second with the idea of being wesley arlott an oceangoing yacht navigation consultant from apparently arkansas but then thought better of it the man had after all taken his registration number and although dirk had no particular recollection of paying an insurance premium of late he also had no particular recollection of not paying one either which was a reasonably promising sign he handed over a bonafide card with a wince the man looked at it mr gently he said private investigator im sony private holistic investigator ok he put the card away taking no further interest dirk had never felt so patronised in his life at that moment there was another quiet click from the other side of the car dirk looked across to see a woman with red spectacles standing there giving him a frozen half smile she was the woman he had spoken with over geoffrey ansteys garden wall this morning and the man dirk therefore supposed was probably her husband he wondered for a second whether he should wrestle them to the ground and question them rigorously and violently but he was suddenly feeling immensely tired and run down he acknowledged the woman in red spectacles with a minute inclination of his head all done cynthia said the man and flicked a smile on and off at her its all taken care of she nodded faintly and the two of them climbed back into their bmw and after a moment or two pulled away without fuss and disappeared away down the road dirk looked at the card in his hand clive draycott he was with a good firm of city solicitors dirk stuck the card away in his wallet climbed despondently back into his car and drove on back to his house where he found a large golden eagle sitting patiently on his doorstep chapter kate rounded on her guest as soon as they were both inside her flat with the door closed and kate could be reasonably certain that neil wasnt going to sneak back out of his flat and lurk disapprovingly half way up the stairs the continuing thumping of his bass was at least her guarantee of privacy all right she said fiercely so what is the deal with the eagle then what is the deal with all the street lights huh the norse god of thunder looked at her awkwardly he had to remove his great horned helmet because it was banging against the ceiling and leaving scratch marks in the plaster he tucked it under his arm what is the deal continued kate with the cocacola machine what is the deal with the hammer what in short is the big deal huh thor said nothing he frowned for a second in arrogant irritation then frowned in something that looked somewhat like embarrassment and then simply stood there and bled at her for a few seconds she resisted the impending internal collapse of her attitude and then realised it was just going to go to hell anyway so she might as well go with it ok she muttered lets get all that cleaned up ill find some antiseptic she went to rummage in the kitchen cupboard and returned with a bottle to find thor saying no at her no what she said crossly putting the bottle down on the table with a bit of a bang that said thor and pushed the bottle back at her no whats the matter with it thor just shrugged and stared moodily at a corner of the room there was nothing that could be considered remotely interesting in that comer of the room so he was clearly looking at it out of sheer bloodymindedness look buster said kate if i can call you buster what thor said thor god of yes said kate youve told me all the things youre god of im trying to clean up your arm sedra said thor holding his bleeding arm out but away from her he peered at it anxiously what crushed leaves of sedra oil of the kernel of the apricot infusion of bitter orange blossom oil of almonds sage and comfrey not this he pushed the bottle of antiseptic off the table and sank into a mood right said kate picked up the bottle and hurled it at him it rebounded off his cheekbone leaving an instant red mark thor lunged forward in a rage but kate simply stood her ground with a finger pointed at him you stay right there buster she said and he stopped anything special you need for that thor looked puzzled for a moment that said kate pointing at the blossoming bruise on his cheek vengeance said thor ill have to see what i can do said kate she turned on her heel and stalked out of the room aher about two minutes of unseen activity kate returned to the room trailed by wisps of steam all right she said come with me she led him into her bathroom he followed her with a great show of reluctance but he followed her kate had been trailed by wisps of steam because the bathroom was full of it the bath itself was overflowing with bubbles and gunk there were some bottles and pots mostly empty lined up along a small shelf above the bath kate picked them up one by one and displayed them at him apricot kernel oil she said and turned it upside down to emphasise its emptiness all in there she added pointing at the foaming bath neroli oil she said picking up the next one distilled from the blossom of bitter oranges all in there she picked up the next one orange cream bath oil contains almond oil all in there she picked up the pots sage and comfrey she said of one and sedra oil one of thems a hand cream and the others hair conditioner but theyre all in there along with a tube of aloe lip preserver some cucumber cleansing milk honeyed beeswax and jojoba oil cleanser rhassoul mud seaweed and birch shampoo rich night cream with vitamin e and a very great deal of cod liver oil im afraid i havent got anything called vengeance but heres some calvin klein obsession she took the stopper from a bottle of perfume and threw the bottle in the bath ill be in the next room when youre done with that she marched out and slammed the door on him she waited in the other room firmly reading a book chapter for about a minute dirk remained sitting motionless in his car a few yards away from his front door he wondered what his next move should be a small cautious one he rather thought the last thing he wanted to have to contend with at the moment was a startled eagle he watched it intently it stood there with a pert magnificence about its bearing its talons gripped tightly round the edge of the stone step from time to time it preened itself and then peered sharply up the street and down the street dragging one of its great talons across the stone in a deeply worrying manner dirk admired the creature greatly for its size and its plumage and its general sense of extreme airworthiness but asking himself if he liked the way that the light from the street lamp glinted in its great glassy eye or on the huge hook of its beak he had to admit that he did not the beak was a major piece of armoury it was a beak that would frighten any animal on earth even one that was already dead and in a tin its talons looked as if they could rip up a small volvo and it was sitting waiting on dirks doorstep looking up and down the street with a gaze that was at once meaningful and mean dirk wondered if he should simply drive off and leave the country did he have his passport no it was at home it was behind the door which was behind the eagle in a drawer somewhere or more likely lost he could sell up the ratio of estate agents to actual houses in the area was rapidly approaching parity one of their lot could come and deal with the house hed had enough of it with its fridges and its wildlife and its ineradicable position on the mailing lists of the american express company or he could he supposed with a slight shiver just go and see what it was the eagle wanted there was a thought rats probably or a small whippet all dirk had to his knowledge was some rice krispies and an old muffin and he didnt see those appealing to this magisterial creature of the air he rather fancied that he could make out fresh blood congealing on the birds talons but he told himself firmly not to be so ridiculous he was just going to have to go and face up to the thing explain that he was fresh out of rats and take the consequences quietly infinitely quietly he pushed open the door of his car and stole out of it keeping his head down he peered at it from over the bonnet of the car it hadnt moved that is to say it hadnt left the district it was still looking this way and that around itself with possibly a heightened sense of alertness dirk didnt know in what remote mountain eyrie the creature had learnt to listen out for the sound of jaguar car door hinges revolving in their sockets but the sound had clearly not escaped its attention cautiously dirk bobbed along behind the line of cars that had prevented him from being able to park directly outside his own house in a couple of seconds all that separated him from the extraordinary creature was a small blue renault what next he could simply stand up and as it were declare himself he would be saying in effect here i am do what you will whatever then transpired the renault could probably bear the brunt there was always the possibility of course that the eagle would be pleased to see him that all this swooping it had been directing at him had been just its way of being matey assuming of course that it was the same eagle that was not such an enormous assumption the number of golden eagles at large in north london at any one time was dirk guessed fairly small or maybe it was just nesting on his doorstep completely by chance enjoying a quick breather prior to having another hurtle through the sky in pursuit of whatever it is that eagles hurtle through the sky after whatever the explanation now dirk realised was the time that he had simply to take his chances he steeled himself took a deep breath and arose from behind the renault like a spirit rising from the deep the eagle was looking in another direction at the time and it was a second or so before it looked back to the front and saw him at which point it reacted with a loud screech and stepped back an inch or two a reaction which dirk felt a little put out by it then blinked rapidly a few times and adopted a sort of perky expression of which dirk did not have the faintest idea what to make he waited for a second or two until he felt the situation had settled down again after all the foregoing excitement and then stopped forward tentatively round the front of the renault a number of quiet interrogative cawing noises seemed to float uncertainly through the air and then after a moment dirk realised that he was making them himself and made himself stop this was an eagle he was dealing with not a budgie it was at this point that he made his mistake with his mind entirely taken up with eagles the possible intentions of eagles and the many ways in which eagles might be considercd to differ from small kittens he did not concentrate enough on what he was doing as he stepped up out of the road and on to a pavement that was slick with the recent drizzle as he brought his rear foot forward it caught on the bumper of the car he wobbled slipped and then did that thing which one should never do to a large eagle of uncertain temper which was to fling himself headlong at it with his arms outstretched the eagle reacted instantly without a seconds hesitation it hopped neatly aside and allowed dirk the space he needed to collapse heavily on to his own doorstep it then peered down at him with a scorn that would have withered a lesser man or at least a man that had been looking up at that moment dirk groaned he had sustained a blow to the temple from the edge of the step and it was a blow he felt that he could just as easily have done without this evening he lay there gasping for a second or two then at last rolled over heavily clasping one hand to his forehead the other to his nose and looked up at the great bird in apprehension reflecting bitterly on the conditions under which he was expected to work when it became clear to him that he appeared for the moment to have nothing to fear from the eagle who was merely regarding him with a kind of quizzical blinking doubt he sat up and then slowly dragged himself back to his feet and wiped and smaacked some of the dirt off his coat then he hunted through his pockets for his keys and unlocked the front door which seemed a little loose he waited to see what the eagle would do next with a slight rustle of its wings it hopped over the lintel and into his hall it looked around itself and seemed to regard what it saw with a little distaste dirk didnt know what it was that eagles expected of peoples hallways but had to admit to himself that it wasnt only the eagle which reacted like that the disorder was not that great but there was a grimness to it which tended to cast a pall over visitors and the eagle was clearly not immune to this effect dirk picked up a large flat envelope lying on his doormat looked inside it to check that it was what he had been expecting then noticed that a picture was missing from the wall it wasnt a particularly wonderful picture merely a small japanese print that he had found in camden passage and quite liked but the point was that it was missing the hook on the wall was empty there was a chair missing as well he realised the possible significance of this suddenly struck him and he hurried through to the kitchen many of his assorted kitchen implements had clearly gone the rack of largely unused sabatier knives the food processor and his radio cassette player had all vanished but he did however have a new fridge it had obviously been delivered by nobby paxtons felonious thugs and he would just have to make the usual little list still he had a new fridge and that was a considerable load off his mind already the whole atmosphere in the kitchen seemed easier the tension had lifted there was a new sense of lightness and springiness in the air which had even communicated itself to the pile of old pizza boxes which seemed now to recline at a jaunty rather than an oppressive angle dirk cheerfully threw open the door to the new fridge and was delighted to find it completely and utterly empty its inner light shone on perfectly clean blue and white walls and on gleaming chrome shelves he liked it so much that he instantly determined to keep it like that he would put nothing in it at all his food would just have to go off in plain view good he closed it again a screech and a flap behind him reminded him that he was entertaining a visiting eagle he turned to find it glaring at him from on top of the kitchen table now that he was getting a little more accustomed to it and had not actually been viciously attacked as he had suspected he might be it seemed a little less fearsome than it had at first it was still a serious amount of eagle but perhaps an eagle was a slightly more manageable proposition than he had originally supposed he relaxed a little and took off his hat pulled off his coat and threw them on to a chair the eagle seemed at this juncture to sense that dirk might be getting the wrong idea about it and flexed one of its claws at him with sudden alarm dirk saw that it did indeed have something that closely resembled congealed blood on the talons he backed away from it hurriedly the eagle then rose up to its full height on its talons and began to spread its great wings out wider and wider beating them very slowly and leaning forward so as to keep its balance dirk did the only thing he could think to do under the cincumstances and bolted from the room slamming the door behind him and jamming the hall table up against it a terrible cacophony of screeching and scratching and buffeting arose instantly from behind it dirk sat leaning back against the table panting and trying to catch his breath and then after a while began to get a worrying feeling about what the bird was up to now it seemed to him that the eagle was actually divebombing itself against the door every few seconds the pattern would repeat itself first a great beating of wings then a rush then a terrible cracking thud dirk didnt think it would get through the door but was alarmed that it might beat itself to death trying the creature seemed to be quite frantic about something but what dirk could not even begin to imagine he tried to calm himself down and think clearly to work out what he should do next he should phone kate and make certain she was all right whoosh thud he should finally open up the envelope he had been carrying with him all day and examine its contents whoosh thud for that he would need a sharp knife whoosh thud three rather awkward thoughts then struck him in fairly quick succession whoosh thud first the only sharp knives in the place assuming nobbys removal people had left him with any at all were in the kitchen whoosh thud that didnt matter so much in itself because he could probably find something in the house that would do whoosh thud the second thought was that the actual envelope itself was in the pocket of his coat which he had left lying over the back of a chair in the kitchen whoosh thud the third thought was very similar to the second and had to do with the location of the piece of paper with kates telephone number on it whoosh thud oh god whoosh thud dirk began to feel very very tired at the way the day was working out he was deeply worried by the sense of impending calamity but was still by no means able to divine what lay at the root of it whoosh thud well he knew what he had to do now whoosh thud so there was no point in not getting on with it he quietly pulled the table away from the door whoosh he ducked and yanked the door open passing smoothly under the eagle as it hurtled out into the hallway and hit the opposite wall he slammed the door closed behind him from inside the kitchen pulled his coat off the chair and jammed the chair back up under the handle whoosh thud the damage done to the door on this side was both considerable and impressive and dirk began seriously to worry about what this behaviour said about the birds state of mind or what the birds state of mind might become if it maintained this behaviour for very much longer whoosh scratch the same thought seemed to have occurred to the bird at that moment and after a brief flurry of screeching and of scratching at the door with its talons it lapsed into a grumpy and defeated silence which after it had been going on for about a minute became almost as disturbing as the previous batterings dirk wondered what it was up to he approached the door cautiously and very very quietly moved the chair back a little so that he could see through the keyhole he squatted down and peered through it at first it seemed to him that he could see nothing through it that it must be blocked by something then a slight flicker and glint close up on the other side suddenly revealed the startling truth which was that the eagle also had an eye up at the keyhole and was busy looking back at him dirk almost toppled backwards with the shock of the realisation and backed away from the door with a sense of slight horror and revulsion this was extremely intelligent behaviour for an eagle wasnt it was it how could he find out he couldnt think of any ornithological experts to phone all his reference books were piled up in other rooms of the house and he didnt think hed be able to keep on pulling off the same stunt with impunity certainly not when he was dealing with an eagle which had managed to figure out what keyholes were for he retrealed to the kitchen sink and found some kitchen towel he folded it into a wad soaked it and dabbed it first on his bleeding temple which was swelling up nicely and then on his nose which was still very tender and had been a considerable size for most of the day now maybe the eagle was an eagle of delicate sensibilities and had reacted badly to the sight of dirks face in its current much abused state and had simply lost its mind dirk sighed and sat down kates telephone which was the next thing he turned his attention to was answered by a machine when he tried to ring it her voice told him very sweetly that he was welcome to leave a message after the beep but warned that she hardly ever listened to them and that it was much better to talk to her directly only he couldnt because she wasnt in so hed best try again thank you very much he thought and put the phone down he realised that the truth of the matter was this he had spent the day putting off opening the envelope because of what he was worried about finding in it it wasnt that the idea was frightening though indeed it was frightening that a man should sell his soul to a greeneyed man with a scythe which is what circumstances were trying very hard to suggest had happened it was just that it was extremely depressing that he should sell it to a greeneyed man with a scythe in exchange for a share in the royalties of a hit record that was what it looked like on the face of it wasnt it dirk picked up the other envelope the one which had been waiting for him on his doormat delivered there by courier from a large london bookshop where dirk had an account he pulled out the contents which were a copy of the sheet music of hot pototo written by colin paignton phil mulville and geoff anstey the lyrics were well straightforward they provided a basic repetitive bit of funk rhythm and a simple sense of menace and cheerful callousness which had caught the mood of last summer they went hot potato dont pick it up pick it up pick it up quick pass it on poss it on poss it on you dont want to get caught get caught get caught drop it on someone who who anybody you better not have it when the big one comes i said you better not have it when the big one comes its a hot potato and so on the repeated phrases got tossed back and forward between the two members of the band the drum machine got heavier and heavier and there had been a dance video was that all it was going to be big deal a nice house in lupton street with polyurethaned floors and a broken marriage things had certainly come down a long way since the great days of faust and mephistopheles when a man could gain all the knowledge of the universe achieve all the ambitions of his mind and all the pleasures of the flesh for the price of his soul now it was a few record royalties a few pieces of trendy furniture a trinket to stick on your bathroom wall and whap your head comes off so what exactly was the deal what was the potato contract who was getting what and why dirk rummaged through a drawer for the breadknife sat down once more took the envelope from his coat pocket and ripped through the congealed strata of sellotape which held the end of it together out fell a thick bundle of papers chapter at exactly the moment that the telephone rang the door to kates sittingroom opened the thunder god attempted to stomp in through it but in fact he wafted he had clearly soaked himself very thoroughly in the stuff kate had thrown into the bath then redressed and torn op a nightgown of kates to bind his forearm with he casually tossed a handful of softened oak shards away into the comer of the room kate decided for the moment to ignore both the deliberate provocations and the telephone the former she could deal with and the latter she had a machine for dealing with ive been reading about you she challenged the thunder god wheres your beard he took the book a one volume encyclopaedia from her hands and glanced at it before tossing it aside contemptuously ha he said i shaved it off when i was in wales he scowled at the memory what were you doing in wales for heavens sake counting the stones he said with a shrug and went to stare out of the window there was a huge moping anxiety in his bearing it suddenly occurred to kate with a spasm of something not entinely unlike fear that sometimes when people got like that it was because they had picked up their mood from the weather with a thunder god it presumably worked the other way round the sky ootside certainly had a restless and disgruntled look her reactions suddenly started to become very confused excuse me if this sounds like a stupid question said kate but im a little at sea here im not used to spending the evening with someone whos got a whole day named after them what stones were you counting in wales all of them said thor in a low growl all of them between this size he held the tip of his forefinger and thumb about a quarter of an inch apart and this size he held his two hands about a yard apart and then put them down again kate stared at him blankly well how many were thene she asked it seemed only polite to ask he rounded on her angrily count them yourself if you want to know he shouted whats the point in my spending years and years and years counting them so that im the only person who knows and who will ever know if i just go and tell somebody else well he turned back to the window anyway he said ive been worried about it i think i may have lost count somewhere in midglamorgan but im not he shouted going to do it again well why on earth would you do such an extraordinary thing in the first place it was a burden placed on me by my father a punishment a penance he glowered your father said kate do you mean odin the allfather said thor father of the gods of asgard and youre saying hes alive thor turned to look at her as if she was stupid we are immortals he said simply downstairs neil chose that moment to conclude his thunderous performance on the bass and the house seemed to sing in its aftermath with an eerie silence immortals are what you wanted said thor in a low quiet voice immortals are what you got it is a little hard on us you wanted us to be for ever so we are for ever then you forget about us but still we are for ever now at last many are dead many dying he then added in a quiet voice but it takes a special effort i cant even begin to understand what youre talking about said kate you say that i we you can begin to understand said thor angrily which is why i have come to you do you know that most people hardly see me hardly notice me at all it is not that we are hidden we are here we move among you my people your gods you gave birth to us you made us be whatyou would not dare to be yourselves yet you will not acknowledge us if i walk along one of your streets in this world you have made for yourselves without us then barely an eye will once flicker in my direction is this when youre wearing the helmet especially when im wearing the helmet well you make fun of me roared thor you make it very easy for a girl said kate i dont know what suddenly the room seemed to quake and then to catch its breath all of kates insides wobbled violently and then held very still in the sudden horrible silence a blue china table lamp slowly toppled off the table hit the floor and crawled off to a dark corner of the room where it sat in a worried little defensive huddle kate stared at it and tried to be calm about it she felt as if cold soft jelly was trickling down her skin did you do that she said shakily thor was looking livid and confused he muttered do not make me angry with you you were very lucky he looked away what are you saying im saying that i wish you to come with me what what about that she pointed at the small befuddled kitten under the table which had so recently and so confusingly been a blue china table lamp theres nothing i can do for it kate was suddenly so tired and confused and frightened that she found she was nearly in tears she stood biting her lip and trying to be as angry as she could oh yeah she said i thought you were meant to be a god i hope you havent got into my home under false pretences i she stumbled to a halt and then resumed in a different tone of voice do you mean she said in a small voice that you have been here in the world all this time here and in asgard said thor asgard said kate the home of the gods thor was silent it was a grim silence that seemed to be full of something that bothered him deeply where is asgard demanded kate again thor did not speak he was a man of very few words and enormously long pauses when at last he did answer it wasnt at all clear whether he had been thinking all that time or just standing there asgard is also here he said all worlds are here he drew out from under his furs his great hammer and studied its head deeply and with an odd curiosity as if something about it was very puzzling kate wondered where she found such a gesture familiar from she found that it instinctively made her want to duck she stepped back very slightly and was watchful when he looked up again there was an altogether new focus and energy in his eyes as if he was gathering himself up to hurl himself at something tonight i must be in asgard he said i must confront my father odin in the great hall of valhalla and bring him to account for what he has done you mean for making you count welsh pebbles no said thor for making the welsh pebbles not worth counting kate shook her head in exasperation i simply dont know what to make of you at all she said i think im just too tired come back tomorrow explain it all in the morning no said thor you must see asgard yourself and then you will understand you must see it tonight he gripped her by the arm i dont want to go to asgard she insisted i dont go to mythical places with strange men you go call me up and tell me how it went in the morning give him hell about the pebbles she wrested her arm from his grip it was very very clear to her that she only did this with his permission now please go and let me sleep she glared at him at that moment the house seemed to erupt as neil launched into a thumping bass rendition of siegfrieds rheinfahrt from act of g tterd mmerung just to prove it could be done the walls shook the windows rattled from under the table the sound of the table lamp mewing pathetically could just be heard kate tried to maintain her furious glare but it simply couldnt be kept up for very long in the circumstances ok she said at last how do we get to this place there are as many ways as there are tiny pieces i beg your pardon tiny things he held up his thumb and forefinger again to indicate something very small molecules he added seeming to be uncomfortable with the word but first let us leave here will i need a coat in asgard as you wish well ill take one anyway wait a minute she decided that the best way to deal with the astonishing rigmarole which currently constituted her life was to be businesslike about it she found her coat brushed her hair left a new message on her telephone answering machine and put a saucer of milk firmly under the table right she said and led the way out of the flat locking it carefully after them and making shushing noises as they passed neils door for all the uproar he was currently making he was almost certainly listening out for the slightest sound and would be out in a moment if he heard them going by to complain about the cocacola machine the lateness of the hour mans inhumanity to man the weather the noise and the colour of kates coat which was a shade of blue that neil for some reason disapproved of most particularly they stole past successfully and closed the front door behind them with the merest click chapter the sheets which tumbled out on to dirks kitchen table were made of thick heavy paper folded together and had obviously been much handled he sorted them out one by one separating them from each other smoothing them out with the flat of his hand and laying them out neatly in rows on the kitchen table clearing a space as it became necessary among the old newspapers ashtrays and dirty cereal bowls which elena the cleaner always left exactly where they were claiming when challenged on this that she thought he had put them there specially he pored over the papers for several minutes moving from one to another comparing them with each other studying them carefully page by page paragraph by paragraph line by line he couldnt understand a word of them it should have occurred to him he realised that the greeneyed hairy scythewaving giant might differ from him not only in general appearance and personal habits but also in such matters as the alphabet he favoured he sat back in his seat disgruntled and thwarted and reached for a cigarette but the packet in his coat was now empty he picked up a pencil and tapped it in a cigarettelike way but it wasnt able to produce the same effect after a minute or two he became acutely conscious of the fact that he was probably still being watched through the keyhole by the eagle and he found that this made it impossibly hard to concentrate on the problem before him particularly without a cigarette he scowled to himself he knew there was still a packet upstairs by his bed but he didnt think he could handle the sheer ornithology involved in going to get it he tried to stare at the papers for a little longer the writing apart from being written in some kind of small crabby and indecipherable runic script was mostly hunched up towards the lefthand side of the paper as if swept there by a tide the righthand side was largely clear except for an occasionai group of characters which were lined up underneath each other all of it except for a slight sense of undefinable familiarity about the layout was completely meaningless to dirk he turned his attention back to the envelope instead and tried once more to examine some of the names which had been so heavily crossed out howard bell the incredibly wealthy bestselling novelist who wrote bad books which sold by the warehouseload despite or perhaps because of the fact that nobody read them dennis hutch record company magnate now that he had a context for the name dirk knew it perfeetly well the aries rising record group which had been founded on sixties ideals or at least on what passed for ideals in the sixties grown in the seventies and then embraced the materialism of the eighties without missing a beat was now a massive entertainment conglomerate on both sides of the atlantic dennis hutch had stepped up into the top seat when its founder had died of a lethal overdose of brick wall taken while under the influence of a ferrari and a bottle of tequila arrgh was also the record label on which hot potato had been released stan dubcek senior partner in the advertising company with the silly name which now owned most of the british and american advertising companies which had not had names which were quite as silly and had therefore been swallowed whole and here suddenly was another name that was instantly recognisable now that dirk was attuned to the sort of names he should be looking for roderick mercer the worlds greatest publisher of the worlds sleaziest newspapers dirk hadnt at first spotted the name with the unfamiliar erick in place after the rod well well well now here were people thought dirk suddenly who had really got something certainly they had got rather more than a nice little house in lupton road with some dried flowers lying around the place they also had the great advantage of having heads on their shoulders as well unless dirk had missed something new and dramatic on the news what did that all mean what was this contract how come everybody whose hands it had been through had been so astoundingly successful except for one geoffrey anstey everybody whose hands it had passed through had benefited from it except for the one who had it last who had still got it it was a hot potato you better not have it when the big one comes the notion suddenly formed in dirks mind that it might have been geoffrey anstey himself who had overheard a conversation about a hot potato about getting rid of it passing it on if he remembered correctly the interview he had read with pain he didnt say that he himself had overheard the conversation you better not have it when the big one comes the notion was a horrible one and ran on like this geoffrey anstey had been pathetically na ve he had overheard this conversation between who dirk picked up the envelope and ran over the list of names and had thought that it had a good dance rhythm he had not for a moment realised that what he was listening to was a conversation that would result in his own hideous death he had got a hit record out of it and when the real hot potato was actually handed to him he had picked it up dont pick it up pick it up pick it up and instead of taking the advice he had recorded in thc words of the song quick pass it on pass it on pass it on he had stuck it behind the gold record award on his bathroom wall you better not have it when the big one comes dirk frowned and took a long slow thoughtful drag on his pencil this was ridiculous he had to got some cigarettes if he was going to think this through with any intellectual rigour he pulled on his coat stuffed his hat on his head and made for the window the window hadnt been opened for well certainly not during his ownership of the house and it struggled and screamed at the sudden unaccustomed invasion of its space and independence once he had forced it wide enough dirk struggled out on to the windowsill pulling swathes of leather coat out with him from here it was a bit of a jump to the pavement since there was a lower ground floor to the house with a narrow flight of steps leading down to it in the front a line of iron railings separated these from the pavement and dirk had to get clear over these without hesitating for a moment he made the jump and it was in midbound that he realised he had not pickcd up his car keys from the kitchen table where hed left them he considered as he sailed gracelessly through the air whether or not to execute a wild midair twist make a desperate grab backwards for the window and hope that he might just manage to hold on to the sill but decided on mature reflection that an error at this point might just conceivably kill him whereas the walk would probably do him good he landed heavily on the far side of the railings but the tails of his coat became entangled with them and he had to pull them off tearing part of the lining in the process once the ringing shock in his knees had subsided and he had recovered what little composure the events of the day had left him with he realised that it was now well after eleven oclock and the pubs would be shut and he might have a longer walk than he had bargained for to find some cigarettes he considered what to do the current outlook and state of mind of tbe eagle was a major factor to be taken into account here the only way to get his car keys now was back through the front door into his eagleinfested hallway moving with great caution he tiptoed back up the steps to his front door squatted down and hoping that the damn thing wasnt going to squeak gently pushed up the flap of the letterbox and peered through in an instant a talon was hooked into the back of his hand and a great screeching beak slashed at his eye narrowly missing it but scratching a great gouge across his much abused nose dirk howled with pain and lurched backwards not getting very far because he still had a talon hooked in his hand he lashed out desperately and hit at the talon which hurt him considerably dug the sharp point even further into his flesh and caused a great barging flurry on the far side of the door each tiniest movement of which tugged heavily in his hand he grabbed at the great claw with his free hand and and tried to tug it back out of himself it was immensely strong and was shaking with the fury of the eagle which was as trapped as he was at last quivering with pain he managed to release himself and pulled his injured hand back nursing and cuddling it with the other the eagle pulled its claw back sharply and dirk heard it flapping away back down his hallway emitting terrible screeches and cries its great wings colliding with and scraping thc walls dirk toyed with the idea of burning the house down but once the throbbing in his hand had begun to subside a little he calmed down and tried if he could to see things from the eagles point of view he couldnt he had not the faintest idea how things appeared to eagles in general much less to this particular eagle which seemed to be a seriously deranged example of the species after a minute or so more of nursing his hand curiosityallied to a strong sense that the eagle had definitely retreated to the far end of the hall and stayed there overcame him and he bent down once more to the letterbox this time he used his pencil to push the flap back upwards and scanned the hallway from a safe position a good few inches back the eagle was clearly in view perched on the end of the bannister rail regarding him with resentment and opprobrium which dirk felt was a little rich coming from a creature which had only a moment or two ago been busily engaged in trying to rip his hand off then once the eagle was certain that it had got dirks attention it slowly raised itself up on its feet and slowly shook its great wings out beating them gently for balance it was this gesture that had previously caused dirk to bolt prudently from the room this time however he was safely behind a couple of good solid inches of wood and he stood or rather squatted his ground the eagle stretched its neck upwards as well jabbing its tongue out at the air and cawing plaintively which surprised dirk then he noticed something else rather surprising about the eagle which was that its wings had strange uneaglelike markings on them they were large concentric circles the differences of coloration which delineated thc circles were very slight and it was only the absolute geometric regularity of them which made them stand out as clearly as they did dirk had the very clear sense that the eagle was showing him these circles and that that was what it had wanted to attract his attention to all along each time the bird had dived at him he realised as he thought back it had then started on a strange kind of flapping routine which had involved opening its wings right out however each time it had happened dirk had been too busily engaged with the business of turning round and running away to pay this exhibition the appropriate attention have you got the money for a cup of tea mate er yes thank you said dirk im fine his attention was fully occupied with the eagle and he didnt immediately look round no i meant can you spare me a bob or two just for a cup of tea what this time dirk looked round irritably or just a fag mate got a fag you can spare no i was just going to go and get some myself said dirk the man on the pavement behind him was a tramp of indeterminate age he was standing there slightly wobbly with a look of wild and continuous disappointment bobbing in his eyes not getting an immediate response from dirk the man dropped his eyes to the ground about a yard in front of him and swayed back and forth a little he was holding his arms out slightly open slightly away from his body and just swaying then he frowned suddenly at the ground then he frowned at another part of the ground then holding himself steady while he made quite a major realignment of his head he frowned away down the street have you lost something said dirk the mans head swayed back towards him have i lost something he said in querulous astonishment have i lost something it seemed to be the most astounding question he had ever heard he looked away again for a while and seemed to be trying to balance the question in the general scale of things this involved a fair bit more swaying and a fair few more frowns at last he seemed to come up with something that might do service as some kind of answer the sky he said challenging dirk to find this a good enough answer he looked up towards it carefully so as not to lose his balance he seemed not to like what he saw in the dim orange streetlit pallor of the clouds and slowly looked back down again till he was staring at a point just in front of his feet the ground he said with evident great dissatisfaction and then was struck with a sudden thought frogs he said wobbling his gaze up to meet dirks rather bewildered one i used to likefrogs he said and left his gaze sitting on dirk as if that was all he had to say and the rest was entirely up to dirk now dirk was completely flummoxed he longed for the times when life had been easy life had been carefree the great times hed had with a mere homicidal eagle which seemed now to be such an easygoing and amiable companion aerial attack he could cope with but not this nameless roaring guilt that came howling at him out of nowhere what do you want he said in a strangled voice just a fag mate said the tramp or something for a cup of tea dirk pressed a pound coin into the mans hand and lunged off down the street in a panic passing twenty yards further on a builders skip from which the shape of his old fridge loomed at him menacingly chapter as kate came down the steps from her house she noticed that the temperature had dropped considerably the clouds sat heavily on the land and loured at it thor set off briskly in the direction of the park and kate trotted along in his wake as he strode along an extraordinary figure on the streets of primrose hill kate could not help but notice that he had been right they passed three different people on the way and she saw distinctly how their eyes avoided looking at him even as they had to make allowance for his great bulk as he passed them he was not invisible far from it he simply didnt fit the park was closed for the night but thor leapt quickly over the spiked railings and then lifted her over in turn as lightly as if she had been a bunch of flowers the grass was damp and mushy but still worked its magic on city feet kate did what she always did when entering the park which was to bob down and put the flats of her hands down on the ground for a moment she had never quite worked out why she did this and often she would adjust a shoe or pick up a piece of litter as a pretext for the movement but all she really wanted was to feel the grass and the wet earth on her palms the park from this viewpoint was simply a dark shoulder that rose up before them obscuring itself they mounted the hill and stood on the top of it looking over the darkness of the rest of the park to where it shaded off into the hazy light of the heart of london which lay to the south ugly towers and blocks stuck yobbishly up out of the skyline dominating the park the sky and the city a cold damp wind moved across the park flicking at it from time to time like the tail of a dark and broody horse there was an unsettled edgy quality to it in fact the night sky seemed to kate to be like a train of restless irritable horses their traces flapping and slapping in the wind it also seemed to her as if the traces all radiated loosely from a single centre and that the centre was very close by her she reprimanded herself for absurd suggestibility but nevertheless it still seemed that all the weather was gathered and circling around them waiting on them thor once more drew out his hammer and held it before him in the thoughtful and abstracted manner she had seen a few minutes before in her flat he frowned and seemed to be picking tiny invisible pieces of dust off it it was a little like a chimpanzee grooming its mate or that was it the comparison was extraordinary but it explained why she had tensed herself so watchfully when last he had done it it was like jimmy connors minutely adjusting the strings of his racquet before preparing to serve he looked up sharply once again drew his arm back turned fully once twice three times twisting his heels heavily in the mud and then hurled his hammer with astonishing force up to the heavens it vanished almost instantly into the murky haze of the sky damp flashes sparked deep within the clouds tracking its path in a long parabola through the night at the furthest extent of the parabola it swung down out of the clouds a distant tiny pinpoint moving slowly now gathering and redirecting its momentum for the return flight kate watched breathless as the speck crept behind the dome of st pauls it then seemed almost as if it had halted altogether hanging silently and improbably in the air before gradually beginning to increase microscopically in size as it accelerated back towards them then as it returned it swung aside in its path no longer describing a simple parabola but following instead a new path which seemed to lie along the perimeter of a gigantic mobius strip which took it round the other side of the telecom tower then suddenly it was swinging back in a path directly towards them hurtling out of the night with impossible weight and speed like a piston in a shaft of light kate swayed and nearly dropped in a dead faint out of its path when thor stepped forward and caught it with a grunt the jolt of it sent a single heavy shudder down into the earth and then the thing was resting quietly in thors grip his arm quivered slightly and was still kate felt quite dizzy she didnt know exactly what it was that had just happened but she felt pretty damn certain that it was the sort of experience that her mother would not have approved of on a first date is this all part of what we have to do to go to asgard she said or are you just fooling around we will go to asgardnow he said at that moment he raised his hand as if to pluck an apple but instead of plucking he made a tiny sharp turning movement the effect was as if he had twisted the entire world through a billionth part of a billionth part of a degree everything shifted was for a moment minutely out of focus and then snapped back again as a suddenly different world this world was a much darker one and colder still a bitter putrid wind blew sharply and made every breath gag in the throat the ground beneath their feet was no longer the soft muddy grass of the hill but a foulsmelling oozing slush darkness lay over all the horizon with a few small exceptional fires dotted here and there in the distance and one great blaze of light about a mile and a half away to the southeast here great fantastical towers stabbed at the night huge pinnacles and turrets flickered in the firelight that surged from a thousand windows it was an edifice that mocked reason ridiculed reality and jeered wildly at the night my fathers palace said thor the great hall of valhalla where we must go it was just on the tip of kates tongue to say that something about the place was oddly familiar when the sound of horses hooves pounding through the mud came to them on the wind at a distance between where they stood and the great hall of valhalla a small number of flickering torches could be seen jolting towards them thor once more studied the head of his hammer with interest brushed it with his forefinger and rubbed it with his thumb then slowly he looked up again he twisted round once then twice and a third time and then hurled the missile into the sky this time however he continued to hold on to its shaft with his right hand while with his left he held kates waist in his grasp chapter cigarettes clearly intended to make themselves a major problem for dirk tonight for most of the day except for when hed woken up and except for again shortly after hed woken up and except for when he had just encountered the revolving head of geoffrey anstey which was understandable and also except for when hed been in the pub with kate he had had absolutely no cigarettes at all not one they were out of his life foresworn utterly he didnt need them he could do without them they merely nagged at him like mad and made his life a living hell but he decided he could handle that now however just when he had suddenly decided coolly rationally as a clear straightforward decision rather than merely a feeble surrender to craving that he would after all have a cigarette could he find one he could not the pubs by this stage of the night were well closed the late night corner shop obviously meant something different by late night than dirk did and though dirk was certain that he could convince the proprietor of the rightness of his case through sheer linguistic and syllogistic bravado the wretched man wasnt there to undergo it a mile away there was a hour filling station but it turned out just to have sustained an armed robbery the plate glass was shattered and crazed round a tiny hole police were swarming over the place the attendant was apparently not badly injured but he was still losing blood from a wound in his arm having hysterics and being treated for shock and no one would sell dirk any cigarettes they simply werent in the mood you could buy cigarettes in the blitz protested dirk people took a pride in it even with the bombs falling and the whole city ablaze you could still get served some poor fellow just lost two daughters and a leg would still say plain or filter tipped if you asked him i expect you would too muttered a whitefaced young policeman it was the spirit of the age said dirk bug off said the policeman and that thought dirk to himself was the spirit of this he retreated miffed and decided to prowl the streets with his hands in his pockets for a while camden passage antique clocks antique clothes no cigarettes upper street antique buildings being ripped apart no sign of cigarette shops being put up in their place chapel market desolate at night wet litter wildly flapping cardboard boxes egg boxes paper bags and cigarette packets empty ones pentonville road grim concrete monoliths eyeing the new spaces in upper street where they hoped to spawn their horrid progeny kings cross station they must have cigarettes for heavens sake dirk hurried on down towards it the old frontage to the station reared up above the area a great yellow brick wall with a clock tower and two huge arches fronting the two great train sheds behind in front of this lay the onestorey modern concourse which was already far shabbier than the building a hundred years its senior which it obscured and generally messed up dirk imagined that when the designs for the modern concourse had been drawn up the architects had explained that it entered into an exciting and challenging dialogue with the older building kings cross is an area where terrible things happen to people to buildings to cars to trains usually while you wait and if you werent careful you could easily end up involved in a piece of exciting and challenging dialogue yourself you could have a cheap car radio fitted while you waited and if you turned your back for a couple of minutes it would be removed while you waited as well other things you could have removed while you waited were your wallet your stomach lining your mind and your will to live the muggers and pushers and pimps and hamburger salesmen in no particular order could arrange all these things for you but could they arrange a packet of cigarettes thought dirk with a mounting sense of tension he crossed york way declined a couple of surprising offers on the grounds that they did not involve cigarettes in any immediately obvious way hurried past the closed bookshop and in through the main concourse doors away from the life of the street and into the safer domain of british rail he looked around him here things seemed rather strange and he wondered why but he only wondered this very briefly because he was also wondering if there was anywhere open selling cigarettes and there wasnt he sagged forlornly it seemed to him that he had been playing catchup with the world all day the morning had started in about as disastrous a way as it was possible for a morning to start and he had never managed to get a proper grip on it since he felt like somebody trying to ride a bolting horse with one foot in a stirrup and the other one still bounding along hopefully on the ground behind and now even as simple a thing as a cigarette was proving to be beyond his ability to get hold of he sighed and found himself a seat or at least room on a bench this was not an immediately easy thing to do the station was more crowded than he had expected to find it at what was it he looked up at the clock one oclock in the morning what in the name of god was he doing on kings cross station at one oclock in the morning with no cigarette and no home that he could reasonably expect to get into without being hacked to death by a homicidal bird he decided to feel sorry for himself that would pass the time he looked around himself and after a while the impulse to feel sorry for himself gradually subsided as he began to take in his surroundings what was strange about it was seeing such an immediately familiar place looking so unfamiliar there was the ticket office still open for ticket sales but looking sombre and beleaguered and wishing it was closed there was the whsmith closed for the night no one would be needing any further newspapers or magazines tonight except for purposes of accommodation and old ones would do just as well for sleeping under the pimps and hookers drugpushers and hamburger salesmen were all outside in the streets and in the hamburger bars if you wanted quick sex or a dirty fix or god help you a hamburger that was where you went to get it here were the people that nobody wanted anything from at all this was where they gathered for shelter until they were periodically shooed out there was something people wanted from them in fact their absence that was in hot demand but not easily supplied everybody has to be somewhere dirk looked from one to another of the men and women shuffling round or sitting hunched in seats or struggling to try and sleep across benches that were specifically designed to prevent them from doing exactly that got a fag mate what no im sorry no i havent got one replied dirk awkwardly patting his coat pockets in embarrassment as if to suggest the making of a search which he knew would be fruitless he was startled to be summoned out of his reverie like this here you are then the old man offered him a beatup one from a beatup packet what oh oh thanks thank you momentarily taken aback by the offer dirk nevertheless accepted the cigarette gratefully and took a light from the tip of the cigarette the old man was smoking himself what you come hene for then asked the old man not challenging just curious dirk tried to look at him without making it seem as if he was looking him up and down the man was wildly bereft of teeth had startled and matted hair and his old clothes were well mulched down around him but the eyes which sagged out of his face were fairly calm he wasnt expecting anything worse than he could deal with to happen to him well just this in fact said dirt twiddling the cigarette thanks couldnt find one anywhere oh ah said the old man got this mad bird at home said dirk kept attacking me oh ah said the man nodding resignedly i mean an actual bird said dirk an eagle oh ah with great wings oh ah got hold of me with one of its talons through the letterbox oh ah dirk wondered if it was worth pursuing the conversation much further he lapsed into silence and looked around youre lucky it didnt slash at you with its beak as well said the old man after a while an eagle will do that when roused it did said dirk it did look right here on my nose that was through the letterbox as well youd scarcely believe it talk about grip talk about reach look at what it did to my hand he held it out for sympathy the old man gave it an appraising look oh ah he said at last and retreated into his own thoughts dirk drew his injured hand back know a lot about eagles then do you the man didnt answer but seemed instead to retreat still further lot of people here tonight dirk ventured again after a while the man shrugged he took a long drag on his cigarette half closing his eyes against the smoke is it always like this i mean are there always so many people here at night the man merely looked down slowly releasing the smoke from his mouth and nostrils yet again dirk looked around a man a few feet away not so oldlooking as dirks companion but wildly deranged in his demeanour had sat nodding hectically over a bottle of cooking brandy all this time he slowly stopped his nodding screwed with difficulty a cap on to the bottle and slipped it into the pocket of his ragged old coat an old fat woman who had been fitfully browsing through the bulging black bin liner of her possessions began to twist the top of it together and fold it youd almost think that something was about to happen said dirk oh ah said his companion he put his hands on his knees bent forward and raised himself painfully to his feet though he was bent and slow and though his clothes were dirtridden and tattered there was some little power and authority there in his bearing the air which he unsettted as he stood which flowed out from the folds of his skin and ctothes was richly pungent even to dirks numbed nostrils it was a smell that never stopped coming at you just as dirk thought it must have peaked so it struck on upwards with renewed frenzy till dirk thought that his very brain would vaporise he tried not to choke indeed he tried to smile courteously without allowing his eyes to run as the man turned to him and said infuse some blossom of the bitter orange add some sprinklings of sage while it is still warm this is very good for eagle wounds there are those who will add apricot and almond oil and even the heavens defend us sedra but then there are always those that will overdo things and sometimes we have need of them oh ah with that he turned away once more and joined the growing stream of pathetic hunched and abused bodies that were heading for the front exit from the station in all about two maybe three dozen were leaving each seemed to be leaving separatety each for his or her entirely independent reasons and not following too fast the one upon the other and yet it was not hard to tell for anyone who cared to watch these people that no one cared to watch or see that they were leaving together and in a stream dirk carefulty nursed his cigarette for a minute or so and watched them intently as one by one they left once he was certain that there were no more to go and that the last two or three of them were at the door he dropped the cigarette and ground it out with his heel then he noticed that the old man had left behind his crumpled cigarette packet dirk looked inside and saw that there were still two bedraggled cigarettes left he pocketed it stood up and quietly followed at a distance that he thought was properly respectful outside on the euston road the night air was grumbling and unsettled he loitered idly by the doorway watching which way they went to the west he took one of the cigarettes out and lit it and then idled off westwards himself around the taxi rank and towards st pancras street on the west side of st pancras street just a few yards north of the euston road a flight of steps leads up to the forecourt of the old midland grand hotel the huge dark gothic fantasy of a building which stands empty and desolate across the front of st pancras railway station over the top of the steps picked out in gold letters on wroughtironwork stands the name of the station taking his time dirk followed the last of the band of old tramps and derelicts up these steps which emerged just to the side of a small squat brick building which was used as a carpark to the right the great dark hulk of the old hotel spread off into the night its roofline a vast assortment of wild turrets gnarled spires and pinnacles which seemed to prod at and goad the night sky high in the dim darkness silent stone figures stood guard behind long shields grouped around pilasters behind wroughtiron railings carved dragons crouched gaping at the sky as dirk gently in his flapping leather coat approached the great iron portals which led to the hotel and to the great vaulted train shed of st pancras station stone figures of winged dogs crouched down from the top of pillars here in the bridged area between the hotel entrance and the station booking hall was parked a large unmarked grey mercedes van a quick glance at the front of it was enough to tell dirk that it was the same one which had nearly forced him off the road several hours earlier in the cotswolds dirk walked into the booking hall a large space with great panelled walls along which were spaced fat marble columns in the form of tonch holders at this time of night the ticket office was closed trains do not run all night from st pancras and beyond it the vast chamber of the station itself the great victorian train shed was shrouded in darkness and shadow dirk stood quietly secluded in the entrance to the booking hall and watched as the old tramps and bag tadies who had entered the station by the main entrance from the forecourt mingled together in the dimness there were now many more than two dozen of them perhaps as many as a hundred and there seemed to be about them an air of repressed excitement and tension as they moved about it seemed to dirk after a while that though he had been surprised at how many of them there had been when he first arrived there seemed now to be fewer and fewer of them he peered into the gloom trying to make out what was happening he detached himself from his seclusion in the entrance to the booking hall and entered the main vault but kept himself nevertheless as close to the side wall as possible as he ventured in towards them there were definitely fewer still of them now a mere handful left he had a distinct sense of people slipping away into the shadows and not reemerging from them he frowned at them the shadows were deep but they werent that deep he began to hurry forward and quickly threw all caution aside to reach the small remaining group but by the time he reached the centre of the concourse where they had been gathered there were none remaining at all and he was left whirling round in confusion in the middle of the great dark empty railway station chapter the only thing which prevented kate screaming was the sheer pressure of air rushing into her lungs as she hurtled into the sky when a few seconds later the blinding acceleration eased a little she found she was gulping and choking her eyes were stinging and streaming to the extent that she could hardly see and there was hardly a muscle in her body which wasnt gibbering with shock as waves of air pummelled past her tearing at her hair and clothes and making her knees knuckles and teeth batter at each other she had to struggle with herself to suppress her urge to struggle on the one hand she absolutely certainly did not want to be let go of insofar as she had any understanding at all of what was happening to her she knew that she did not want to be let go of on the other hand the physical shock of it was facing some stiff competition from her sheer affronted rage at being suddenly hauled into the sky without warning the result of this was that she struggled rather feebly and was angry at herself for doing so she ended up clinging to thors arm in the most abject and undignified way the night was dark and the blessing of this she supposed was that she could not see the ground the lights she had seen dotted here and there in the distance now swung sickeningly away beneath her but her instincts would not identify them as representing ground already the flickering beacons which shone from the insanely turreted building she had glimpsed seconds before this outrage occurred were swaying away behind her now at an increasing distance they were still ascending she could not struggle she could not speak she could probably if she tried bite the stupid brutes arm but she contented herself with the idea of this rather than the actual deed the air was bad and rasped in her lungs her nose and eyes were streaming and this made it impossible for her to look forward when she did try it just once she caught a momentary blurred glimpse of the head of the hammer streaking out through the dark air of them of thors arm grasping its stunted handle and being pulled forward by it his other arm was gripped around her waist the strength of him defied her imagination but did not make her any the less angry she got the feeling that they were now skimming along just beneath the clouds every now and then they would be buffeted by damp clamminess and breathing would become yet harder and more noxious the wet air tasted bitter and deadly cold and her streaming wet hair lashed and slammed about her face she decided that the cold was definitely going to kill her and after a while was convinced that she was beginning to lose consciousness in fact she realised she was actually trying to lose consciousness but she couldnt time slipped into a greyness though and she was less aware of how much of it was passing at last she began to sense that they were slowing and that they were beginning to curve back downwards this precipitated fresh waves of nausea and disorientation in her and she felt that her stomach was being slowly turned through a mangle the air was if anything getting worse it smelled worse tasted more acrid and seemed to be getting a great deal more turbulent they were definitely slowing now and the going was becoming more and more difficult the hammer was clearly pointing downwards now and finding its way along rather than surging ahead down still further they went battling through the thickening clouds that swirled round them till it seemed that they must now reach all the way down to the ground their speed had dropped to the point where kate felt able to look ahead now though the acridity of the air was such that she was only able to manage a very brief glance in the moment that she glanced thor released the hammer she couldnt believe it he released it only for a fraction of a second just to change his grip on the thing so that they were now hanging from the shaft as it flew slowly forward rather than being pulled along by it as he redistributed his weight into this new posture he hoisted kate firmly upwards as if pulling up a sock down they went and down further and further there was now a roaring crashing sound borne in on them by the wind from up ahead and suddenly thor was running leaping over rocky sandy scrubland dancing through the knotted tussocks and finally pounding and drumming his feet to a halt they stood still at last swaying but the ground on which they stood was solid kate breathed for a few seconds bending over to catch her breath she then pulled herself up to her full height and was about to deliver a full account of her feelings concerning these events at the top of her voice when she suddenly got an alarming sense of where she was standing though the night was dark the wind whipping at her and the pungent smell of it told her that some kind of sea was very close by the sound of wild crashing breakers told her that in fact it was more or less beneath her that they were standing very near to the edge of a cliff she gripped the arm of the insufferable god who had brought her here and hoped vainly that it hurt him as her reeling senses began gradually to calm down she noticed that there was a dim light spreading away before her and after a while she realised that this was coming off the sea the whole sea was glowing like an infection it was rearing itself up in the night lunging and thrashing in a turmoil of itself and then smashing itself to pieces in a frenzy of pain against the rocks of the coast sea and sky seethed at each other in a poisonous fury kate watched it speechlessly and then became aware of thor standing at her shoulder i met you at an airport he said his voice breaking up in the wind i was trying to get home to norway by plane he pointed out to sea i wanted you to see why i couldnt come this way where are we what is this asked kate fearfully in your world this is the north sea said thor and turned away inland again walking heavily and dragging his hammer behind him kate pulled her wet coat close around her and hurried after him well why didnt you just fly home the way we just did but in well in our world the rage in her had subsided into vague worries about vocabulary i tried responded thor still walking away well what happened i dont want to talk about it what on earths the point of that im not going to discuss it kate shuddered in exasperation is this godlike behaviour she shouted it bothers you so you wont talk about it thor thor is it you this last was a thin voice trailing over the wind kate peered into the wind through the darkness a lantern was bobbing towards them from behind a low rise is that you thor a little old lady came into view holding a lantern above her head hobbling enthusiastically i thought that must be your hammer i saw welcome she chirruped oh but you come in dismal times i was just putting the pot on and thinking of having a cup of something and then perhaps killing myself but then i said to myself just wait a couple of days longer tsuliwa tsuwila swuli tsuliwa nsis i can never pronounce my own name properly when im talking to myself and it drives me hopping mad as im sure you can imagine such a bright boy as ive always maintained never mind what those others say so i said to myself tsuliwa nsis see if anyone comes along and if they dont well then might be a good time to think about killing myself and look now here you are oh but you are welcome welcome and i see youve brought a little friend are you going to introduce me hello my dear hello my names tsuliwa nsis and i wont be at all offended if you stutter i im er kate said kate totally flummoxed yes well im sure that will be all right said the old woman sharply anyway come along if youre coming if youre going to hang around out here all night i may as well just get straight on with killing myself now and let you get your own tea when youre quite ready come along she hurried on ahead and in a very few yards they reached a terrible kind of ramshackle structure of wood and mud which looked as if it had become unaccountably stuck while half way through collapsing kate glanced at thor hoping to read some kind of reaction from him to give her a bearing on the situation but he was occupied with his own thoughts and was clearly not about to share them thene seemed to her to be a difference in the way he moved though in the brief experience she had of him he seemed constantly to be struggling with some internal and constrained anger and this she felt had lifted not gone away just lifted he stood aside to allow her to enter tsuliwa nsiss shack and brusquely gestured her to go in he followed ducking absurdly a few seconds later having paused for a moment outside to survey what little could be seen of the surrounding landscape inside was tiny a few boards with straw for a bed a simmering pot hung over a fire and a box tucked away in the corner for sitting on and this is the knife i was thinking of using you see said tsuliwa nsis fussing around just been sharpening it up nicely you see it comes up very nice if you get a nice sweeping action with the stone and i was thinking here would be a good place you see here on the wall i can stick the handle in this crack so its held nice and firm and then just go fling and fling myself at it fling you see i wonder should it be a little lower what do you think my dear know about these things do you kate explained that she did not and managed to sound reasonably calm about it tsuliwa nsis said thor we have come not to stay but totsuli please put the knife down tsuliwa nsis was standing looking up at them quite chirpily but she was also holding the knife with its great heavy sweeping blade poised over her own left wrist dont mind me dears she said im quite comfortable i can just pop off any time im ready happy to these times are not to live in oh no you go off and be happy i wont disturb your happiness with the sound of me screaming ill hardly make a sound with the knife as you go she stood quivering and challenging carefully almost gently thor reached out and drew the knife away and out of her shaking hand the old woman seemed to crumple as it went and all the performance faded out of her she sat back in a heap on her box thor squatted down in front of her slowly drew her to him and hugged her she gradually seemed to come back to life and eventually pushed him away telling him not to be so stupid and then made a bit of a fuss of smoothing out her hopelessly ragged and dirty black dress when once she had composed herself properly she turned her attention to kate and looked her up and down youre a mortal dear arent you she said at last well yes said kate i can tell it from your fancy dress oh yes well now you see what the world looks like from the other side dont you dear what do you think then kate explained that she did not yet know what to think thor sat himself down on the floor and leant his big head back against the wall halfclosing his eyes kate had the sense that he was preparing himself for something it used to be things were not so different continued the old woman used to be lovely here you know all lovely bit of give and take between us terrible rows of course terrible fights but really it was all lovely now she let out a long and tired sigh and brushed a bit of nothing much off the wall oh things are bad she said things are very bad you see things get affected by things our world affects your world your world affects our world sometimes it is hard to know exactly what that effect is very often it is hard to like it either most of them these days are difficult and bad but our worlds are so nearly the same in so many ways where in your world you have a building there will be a structure here as well maybe it will be a small muddy hillock or a beehive or an abode like this one maybe it will be something a little grander but it will be something you all right thor dear the thunder god closed his eyes and nodded his elbows lay easily across his knees the ragged strips of kates nightgown bound about his left forearm were limp and wet he idly pushed them off and where there is something which is not dealt with properly in your world the old lady pranled on as like as not it will emerge in ours nothing disappears no guilty secret no unspoken thought it may be a new and mighty god in our world or it may be just a gnat but it will be here i might add that these days it is more often a gnat than a new and mighty god oh there are so many more gnats and fewer immortal gods than once there were how can there be fewer immortals asked kate i dont want to be pedantic about it but well theres being immortal dear and then again theres being immortal i mean if i could just get this knife properly secured and then work up a really good fling wed soon see who was immortal and who wasnt tsuli admonished thor but didnt open his eyes to do it one by one were going though we are thor youre one of the few that care theres few enough now that havent succumbed to alcoholism or the onx what is that some kind of disease asked kate she was beginning to feel cross again having been dragged unwillingly from her flat and hurled across the whole of east anglia on the end of a hammer she was irritated at being then just abandoned to a conversation with an insanely suicidal old woman while thor just sat and looked content with himself leaving her to make an effort she was not in a mood to make its an affliction dear which only gods get it really means that you cant take being a god any more which is why only gods get it you see i see in the final stages of it you simply lie on the ground and after a while a tree grows out of your head and then its all over you rejoin the earth seep into its bowels flow through its vital arteries and eventually emerge as a great pure torrent of water and as like as not get a load of chemical waste dumped into you its a grim business being a god nowadays even a dead god well she said patting her knees her eyes hovered on thor who had opened his eyes but was only using them to stare at his own knuckles and fingertips well i hear you have an appointment tonight thor hmm grunted thor without moving i hear youve called together the great hall for the challenging hour is that right hmm said thor the challenging hour hmm well i know that things have not been too good between you and your father for a long time hmm thor wasnt going to be drawn he said nothing i thought it was quite dreadful about wales continued tsuliwa nsis dont know why you stood for it of course i realise that hes your father and the allfather which makes it difficult but odin odin ive known him for so long you know that he made a deal once to sacrifice one of his own eyes in exchange for wisdom of course you do dear youre his son arent you well what ive always said is he should stand up and make a fuss about that particular deal demand his eye back do you know what i mean by that thor and that horrible toe rag theres someone to be careful of thor very careful indeed well i expect i shall hear all about it in the morning wont i thor slid his back up the wall and stood up he clasped the old woman warmly by the hands and smiled a tight smile but said nothing with a slight nod he gestured to kate that they were leaving since leaving was what she most wanted in all the world to do she resisted the temptation to say oh yeah and kick up a fuss about being treated like this meekly she bade a polite farewell to the old woman and made her way out into the murky night thor followed her she folded her arms and said well where now what other great social events have you got in store for me this evening thor prowled around a linle examining the ground he pulled out his hammer and weighed it appreciatively in his hands he peered out into the night and swung the hammer a couple of times idly he swung himself round a couple of times again not hard he loosed the hammer which bounded off into the night and split open a casually situated rock a couple of dozen yards away and then bounded back he caught it easily tossed it up into the air and caught it easily again then he turned to her and looked her in the eye for the first time would you like to see something he asked chapter a gust of wind blew through the huge vaults of the empty station and nearly provoked in dirk a great howl of frustration at the trail that had so suddenly gone cold on him the cold moonlight draped itself through the long ranges of glass panels that extended the length of the st pancras station roof it fell on empty rails and illuminated them it fell on the train departures board it fell on the sign which explained that today was a blue saver day and illuminated them both framed in the archway formed by the far end of the vaulted roof were the fantastical forms of five great gasometers the supporting superstructures of which seemed in their adumbrations to be tangled impossibly with each other like the hoops of an illusionists conjuring trick the moonlight illuminated these as well but dirk it did not illuminate he had watched upwards of a hundred people or so simply vanish into thin air in a way that was completely impossible that in itself did not give him a problem the impossible did not bother him unduly if it could not possibly be done then obviously it had been done impossibly the question was how he paced the area of the station which they had all vanished from and scanned everything that could be seen from every vantage point within it looking for any clue any anomaly anything that might let him pass into whatever it was he had just seen a hundred people pass into as if it was nothing he had the sense of a major party taking place in the near vicinity to which he had not been invited in desperation he started to spin around with his arms outstretched then decided this was completely futile and lit a cigarette instead he noticed that as he had pulled out the packet a piece of paper had fluttered from his pocket which once the cigarette was burning well he stooped to retrieve it was nothing exciting just the bill he had picked up from the stroppy nurse in the caf outrageous he thought about each of the items in turn as he scanned down them and was about to screw it up and throw it away when a thought struck him about the general layout of the document the items charged were listed down the left hand side and the actual charges down the right on his own bills when he issued them when he had a client which was rare at the moment and the ones he did have seemed unable to stay alive long enough to receive his bills and be outraged by them he usually went to a little trouble about the items charged he constructed essays little paragraphs to describe them he liked the client to feel that he or she was getting his or her moneys worth in this respect at least in short the bills he issued corresponded in layout almost exactly to the wad of papers with indecipherable runic scripts which he had been unable to make head or tail of a couple of hours previously was that helpful he didnt know if the wad was not a contract but a bill what might it be the bill for what services had been performed they must certainly have been intricate services or at least intricately described services which professions might that apply to it was at least something to think about he screwed up the caf bill and moved off to throw it into a bin as it happened this was a fortuitous move it meant that he was away from the central open space of the station and near a wall against which he could press himself inconspicuously when he suddenly heard the sound of two pairs of feet crossing the forecourt outside in a few seconds they entered the main part of the station by which time dirk was well out of sight round the angle of a wall being well out of sight worked less well for him in another respect which was that for a while he was unable to see the owners of the feet by the time he caught a glimpse of them they had reached exactly the same area where a few minutes previously a small horde of people had quietly and without fuss vanished he was surprised by the red spectacles of the woman and the quietly tailred italian suit of the man and also the speed with which they themselves then immediately vanished dirk stood speechless the same two damn people who had been the bane of his life for the entire day he allowed himself this slight exaggeration on the grounds of extreme provocation had now flagrantly and deliberately disappeared in front of his eyes once he was quite certain that they had absolutely definitely vanished and were not merely hiding behind each other he ventured out once more into the mysterious space it was bafflingly ordinary ordinary tarmacadam ordinary air ordinary everything and yet a quantity of people that would have kept the bermuda triangle industry happy for an entire decade had just vanished in it within the space of five minutes he was deeply aggravated he was so deeply aggravated that he thought he would share the sense of aggravation by phoning someone up and aggravating them as it would be almost certain to do at twenty past one in the morning this wasnt an entirely arbitrary thought he was still anxious concerning the safety of the american girl kate schechter and had not been at all reassuned to have been answered by her machine when last he had called by now she should surely be at home and in bed asleep and would be reassuringly livid to be woken by a meddling phone call at this time he found a couple of coins and a working telephone and dialled her number he got her answering machine again it said that she had just out for the night to asgard she wasnt certain which parts of asgard they were going to but they would probably swing by valhalla later if the evening was up to it if he cared to leave a message she would deal with it in the morning if she was still alive and in the mood there were some beeps which rang on in dirks ear for seconds after he heard them oh he said realising that the machine was currently busy taping him good heavens well i thought the arrangement was that you were going to call me befone doing anything impossible he put the phone down his head spinning angrily valhalla eh was that where everybody was going to tonight except him he had a good mind to go home go to bed and wake up in the grocery business valhalla he looked about him once again with the name valhalla ringing in his ears there was no doubt he felt that a space this size would make a good feasting hall for gods and dead heroes and that the empty midland grand hotel would be almost worth moving the shebang from norway for he wondered if it made any difference knowing what it was you were walking into nervously tentatively he walked across and through the space in question nothing oh well he turned and stood surveying it for a moment or two while he took a couple of slow drags on the cigarette he had got from the tramp the space didnt look any different he walked back through it again this time a little less tentatively but with slow positive steps once again nothing happened but then just as he was moving out of it at the end he half fancied that he half heard a half moment of some kind of raucous sound like a burst of white noise on a twisted radio dial he turned once more and headed back into the space moving his head carefully round trying to pick up the slightest sound for a while he didnt catch it then suddenly there was a snatch of it that burst around him and was gone a movement and another snatch he moved very very slowly and carefully with the most slight and gentle movements trying to catch at the sound he moved his head round what seemed like a billionth part of a billionth part of a degree slipped behind a molecule and was gone he had instantly to duck to avoid a great eagle swooping out of the vast space at him chapter it was another eagle a different eagle the next one was a different eagle too and the next the air seemed to be thick with eagles and it was obviously impossible to enter valhalla without getting swooped on by at least half a dozen of them even eagles were being swooped on by eagles dirk threw up his arms over his head to fend off the wild beating flurries turned tripped and fell down behind a huge table on to a floor of heavy damp earthy straw his hat rolled under the table he scrambled after it stuffed it back firmly on his head and slowly peered up over the table the hall was dark but alive with great bonfires noise and woodsmoke filled the air and the smells of roasting pigs roasting sheep roasting boar and sweat and reeking wine and singed eagle wings the table he was crouched behind was one of countless slabs of oak on trestles that stretched in every direction laden with steaming hunks of dead animals huge breads great iron beakers slopping with wine and candles like wax anthills massive sweaty figures seethed around them on them eating drinking fighting over the food fighting in the food fighting with the food a yard or so from dirk a warrior was standing on top of a table fighting a pig which had been roasting for six hours and he was clearly losing but losing with vim and spirit and being cheered on by other warriors who were dousing him down with wine from a trough the roof as much of it as could be made out at this distance and by the dark and flickering light of the bonfires was made of lashedtogether shields dirk clutched his hat kept his head down and ran trying to make his way towards the side of the hall as he ran feeling himself to be virtually invisible by reason of being completely sober and by his own lights normally dressed he seemed to pass examples of every form of bodily function imaginable other than actual teethcleaning the smell like that of the tramp in kings cross station who must surely be here participating was one that never stopped coming at you it grew and grew until it seemed that your head had to become bigger and bigger to accommodate it the din of sword on sword sword on shield sword on flesh flesh on flesh was one that made the eardrums reel and quiver and want to cry he was pummelled tripped elbowed shoved and drenched with wine as he scumed and pushed through the wild throng but arrived at last at a side wall massive slabs of wood and stone faced with sheets of stinking cow hide panting he stopped for a moment looked back and surveyed the scene with amazement it was valhalla of that there would be absolutely no question this was not something that could be mocked up by a catering company and the whole seething wild mass of carousing gods and warriors and their carousedat ladies with their shields and fires and boars did seem to fill a space that must be something approaching the size of st pancras station the sheer heat that rose off it all seemed as if it should suffocate the flocks of deranged eagles which thrashed through the air above them and maybe it was he was by no means certain that a flock of enraged eagles which thought that they might be suffocating would behave significantly differently from many of the eagles he was currently watching there was something he had been putting off wondering while he had fought his way through the mass but the time had come to wonder it now what he wondered about the draycotts what could the draycotts possibly be doing here and whene in such a m l e could the draycotts possibly be he narrowed his eyes and peered into the heaving throng trying to see if he could locate anywhere a pair of red designer spectacles or a quiet italian suit mingling out there with the clanging breastplates and the sweaty leathers knowing that the attempt was futile but feeling that it should be made no he decided he couldnt see them not he felt their kind of party further reflections along these lines were cut short by a heavy shorthandled axe which hurtled through the air and buried itself with an astounding thud in the wall about three inches from his left ear and for a moment blotted out all thought when he recovered from the shock of it and let his breath out he thought that it was probably not somethiog that had been thrown at him with malicious intent but was merely warriorly high spirits nevertheless he was not in a partying mood and decided to move on he edged his way along the wall in the direction which had this actually been st pancras station rather than the hall of valhalla would have led to the ticket office he didnt know what he would find there but he reckoned that it must be different to this which would be good it seemed to him that things were generally quieter here out on the periphery the biggest and best of the good tunes soemed to be concentrated more strongly towanls the middle of the hall whereas the tables he was passing now seemed to be peopled with those who looked as if they had teached that season in their immortal lives when they preferred to contemplate the times when they used to wrestle dead pigs and to pass appreciative comments to each other about the finer points of dead pig wrestling technique than actually to wrestle with one again themselves just at the moment he overheard one remark to his companion that it was the lefthanded threefingered flat grip on the opponents sternum that was allimportant at the crucial moment of finally not quite falling over in a complete stupor to which his companion responded with a benign oh ah dirk stopped looked and backtracked sitting hunched in a thoughtful posture over his iron plate and clad in heavily stained and matted furs and buckles which were if anything more rank and stinking than the ensemble dirk had last encountered him in was dirks companion from the concourse at kings cross station dirk wondered how to approach him a quick backslap and a hey good party lot of energy was one strategy but dirk didnt think it was the right one while he was wondering an eagle suddenly swooped down from out of the air and with a lot of beating and thrashing landed on the table in front of the old man folded its wings and advanced on him demanding to be fed easily the old man pulled a bit of meat off a bone and held it up to the great bird which pecked it sharply but accurately out of his fingers dirk thought that this was the key to a friendly approach he leant over the table and picked up a small hunk of meat and offered it in turn to the bird the bird attacked him and went for his neck forcing him to try and beat the savage creature off with his hat but the introduction was made oh ah said the man shooed the eagle away and shifted a couple of inches along the bench though it was not a fulsome invitation it was at least an invitation dirk clambered over the bench and sat down thank you said dirk puffing oh ah if you remember we at that moment the most tremendous reverberating thump sounded out across velhalla it was the sound of a drum being beaten but it sounded like a drum of immense proportions as it had to be to make itself heard over the tumult of noise with which the hall was filled the drum sounded three times in slow and massive beats like the heartbeat of the hall itself dirk looked up to see where the sound might have come from he noticed for the first time that at the south end of the hall to which he had been heading a great balcony or bridge extended across most of its width there were some figures up there dimly visible through the heat haze and the eagles but dirk had a sense that whoever was up there presided over whoever was down here odin thought dirk odin the allfather must be up on the balcony the sound of the revels died down quickly though it was several seconds before the reverberations of the noise finally fell away when all was quiet but expectant a great voice rang out from the balcony and through the hall the voice said the time of the challenging hour is nearly at an end the challenging hour has been called by the god thor for the third time of asking where is thor a murmuring throughout the hall suggested that nobody knew where thor was and why he had not come to make his challenge the voice said this is a very grave affront to the dignity of the allfather if there is no challenge before the expiration of the hour the penalty for thor shall be correspondingly grave the drum beat again three times and the consternation in the hall increased where was thor hes with some girl said a voice above the rest and there were loud shouts of laughter and a return to the hubbub of before yes said dirk quietly i expect he probably is oh ah dirk had supposed that he was talking to himself and was surprised to have elicited a response from the man though not particularly surprised at the response that had been elicited thor called this meeting tonight dirk asked him oh ah bit rude not to turn up oh ah i expect everyones n bit upset not as long as theres enough pigs to go round pigs oh ah dirk didnt immediately know how to go on from here oh ah he said resignedly its only thor as really cares you see said the old man keeps on issuing his challenge then not being able to prove it cant argue gets all confused and angry does something stupid cant sort it out and gets made to do a penance everybody else just turns up for the pigs oh ah dirk was learning a whole new conversational technique and was astonished at how successful it was he regarded the man with a newfound respect do you know how many stones there are in wales asked the man suddenly oh ah said dirk warily he didnt know this joke nor do i he wont tell anybody says count em yourself and goes off in a sulk oh ah he didnt think it was a very good one so this time he hasnt even turned up cant say i blame him but im sorry because i think he might be right oh ah the man lapsed into silence dirk waited oh ah he said again hopefully nothing so er said dirk going for a cautious prompt you think he might be right eh oh ah soold thor might be right eh thats the story said dirk oh ah in what way said dirk running out of patience at last do you think he might be right oh every way oh ah said dirk defeated its no secret that the gods have fallen on hard times said the old man grimly thats clear for all to see even for the ones who only care about the pigswhich is most of em and when you feel youre not needed any more it can be hard to think beyond the next pigeven if you used to have the whole world there with you everyone just accepts it as inevitable everyone except thor that is and now hes given up hasnt even bothered to turn up and break a pig with usgiven up his challenge oh ah oh ah said dirk oh ah so er thors challenge then said dirk tentatively oh ah what was it oh ah dirk lost his patience entirely and rounded on the man what was thors challenge to odin he insisted angrily the man looked round at him in slow surpriselookcd him up and down with his big sagging eyes youre a mortal arent you yes said dirk testily im a mortal of course im a mortal what has being a mortal got to do with it how did you get here i followed you he pulled the screwed up empty cigarette packet out of his pocket and put it on the table thanks he said i owe you it was a pretty feeble type of apology he thought but it was the best he could manage oh ah the man looked away what was thors challenge to odin said dirk trying hard to keep the impatience out of his voice this time what does it matter to you the old immortal said bitterly youre a mortal why should you care youve got what you want out of it you and your kind for what little its now worth got what we want out of what the deal said the old immortal the contract that thor claims odin has entered into contract said dirk what contract the mans face filled with an expression of slow anger the bonfires of valhalla danced deeply in his eyes as he looked at dirk the sale he said darkly of an immortal soul what said dirk he had already considered this idea and discounted it you mean a man has sold his soul to him what man it doesnt make sense no said the man that wouldnt make sense at all i said an immortal soul thor says that odin has sold his soul to man dirk stared at him with horror and then slowly raised his eyes to the balcony something was happening there the great drum beat out again and the hall of valhalla began to hush itself once more but a second or third drumbeat failed to come something unexpected seemed to have occurred and the figures on the balcony were moving in some confusion the challenging hour was just expiring but a challenge of some kind seemed to have arrived dirk beat his palms to his forehead and swayed where he sat as all kinds of realisations finally dawned on him not to man he said but to a man and a woman a lawyer and an advertiser i said it was all her fault the moment i saw her i didnt realise i might actually be right he rounded on his companion urgently i have to get up there he said for gods sake help me chapter odddddiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnn thor let out a bellow of rage which made the sky shake the heavy clouds let out a surprised grunt of thunder at the sheer volume of air that moved beneath them kate started back white with fear and shock with her ears ringing toe rag he hurled his hammer to the ground right at his very feet with both hands he hurled it this short distance with such astounding force that it hit and rebounded into the air up to about a hundred feet ggggrrrrrraaaaaaaah with an immense explosion of air from his lungs he hurled himself up into the air after it caught it just as it was beginning to drop and hurled it straight back down at the ground again catching it again as it bounded back up twisting violently round in midair and hurling it with all the force he could muster out to sea before falling to the ground himself on his back and pounding the earth with his ankles elbows and fists in an incredible tattoo of rage the hammer shot out over the sea on a very low trajectory the head went down into the water and planed through it at a constant depth of about six inches a sharp ripple opened slowly but easily across its surface extending eventually to about a mile as the hammer sliced its way through it like a surgeons knife the inner walls of the ripple deepened smoothly in its wake falling away from the sheer force of the hammer till a vast valley had opened in the face of the sea the walls of the valley wobbled and swayed uncertainly then folded up and crashed together in crazed and foaming tumult the hammer lifted its head and swung up high into the air thor leapt to his feet and watched it still pounding his feet on the ground like a boxer but like a boxer who was perhaps about to precipitate a major earthquake when the hammer reached the top of its trajectory thor hurled his fist downwards like a conductor and the hammer hurtled down into the crashing mass of sea that seemed to calm the sea for a moment in the same way that a smack in the face will calm a hysteric the moment passed an immense column of watcr crupted out of the smack and seconds later the hammer exploded upwards out of its centre pulling another huge column of water up from the middle of the first one the hammer somersaulted at the top of its rise turned spun and rushed back to its owner like a wildly overexcited puppy thor caught at it but instead of stopping it he allowed it to carry him backwards and together they tumbled back through the rocks for about a hundred yards and scuffled to a halt in some soft earth instantly thor was back on his feet again he turned round and round bounding from one leg to the other with strides of nearly ten feet swinging the hammer round him at arms length when he released it again it raced out to sea once more but this time it tore round the surface in a giant semicircle causing the sea to rear up around its circumference to form for a moment a gigantic amphitheatre of water when it fell forward it crashed like a tidal wave ran forward and threw itself enraged against the short wall of the cliff the hammer returned to thor who threw it off again instantly in a great overarm it flew into a rock hitting off a fat angry spark it bounded off further and hit a spark off another rock and another thor threw himself forward on to his knees and with each rock the hammer hit he pounded the ground with his fist to make the rock rise to meet the hammer spark after spark erupted from the rocks the hammer hit each successive one harder and harder until one spark provoked a warning lick of lightning from the clouds and then the sky began to move slowly like a great angry animal uncoiling in its lair the pounding sparks flew faster and heavier from the hammer more lightning licks arced down to meet them from the sky and the whole earth was beginning to tremble in something very like fearful excitement thor hauled his elbows up above his head and then thrust them hard down with another ringing bellow at the sky oddddiiiiiiinnnnnn the sky seemed about to crack open toe raaaaagggggggggg thor throw himself into the ground heaving aside about two skipsful of rocky carth he shook with expanding rage with a deep groan the whole of the side of the cliff began slowly to lean forward into the sea as he pushed and shook in a few seconds more it tumbled heavily into the seething torment beneath it as thor clambered back seized a rock the size of a grand piano and held it above his head everything seemed still for a fleeting moment thor hurled the rock into the sea he regained his hammer o he bellowed ddddddddinnnnnnn his hammer cracked down a torrent of water erupted from the ground and the sky exploded lightning flickered down like a white wall of light for miles along the coast in either direction thunder roared like colliding worlds and the clouds vomited rain that shattered the ground thor stood exulting in the torrent a few minutes later and the violence abated a strong and steady rain continued to fall the clouds were cleansing themselves and the weak rays of the early morning light began to find their way through the thinning cover thor trudged back up from where he had been standing slapping and washing the mud from his hands he caught at his hammer when it flew to him he found kate standing watching him shivering with astonishment fear and fury what was that all about she yelled at him i just needed to be able to lose my temper properly he said when this didnt seem to satisfy her he added a god can show off once in a while cant he the huddled figure of tsuliwa nsis came hurrying out through the rain towards them youre a noisy boy thor she scolded a noisy boy but thor was gone when they looked they guessed that he must be the tiny speck hurtling northwards through the clearing sky chapter cynthia draycott peered over the balcony at the sceene below them with distaste valhalla was back in full swing i hate this she said i dont want this going on in my life you dont have to my darling said clive draycott quietly from behind her with his hands on her shoulders its all going to be taken care of right now and its going to work out just fine couldnt be better in fact its just what we wanted you know you look fantastic in those glasses they really suit you i mean really theyre very chic clive it was meant to have been taken care of originally the whole point was that we werent to be troubled we could just do it deal with it and forget about it that was the whole point ive put up with enough shit in my life i just wanted it to be good per cent i dont want all this exactly and thats why this is so perfect for us so perfect clear breach of contract we get everything we wanted now and were released from all obligations perfecto we come out of it smelling of roses and we have a life that is just per cent good per cent and clean just exactly as you wanted it really it couldnt be better for us trust me cynthia draycott hugged herself irritably so what about this newperson something else we have to deal with itll be so easy so easy listen this is nothing we either cut him in to it or we cut him right out itll be taken care of before we leave here well buy him something a new coat maybe well have to buy him a new house know what thatll cost us he gave a charming laugh its nothing you wont ever even need to think about it you wont ever even need to think about not thinking about it its that easy ok hm ok ill be right back he turned and headed back into the antechamber of the hall of the allfattier smiling all the way so mr he made a show of looking at the card again gently you want to act for these people do you these immortal gods said dirk ok gods said draycott thats fine perhaps youll do a better job than the manic little hustler i had to deal with first time out you know hes really quite a little character our mr rag mr rag you know that guy was really quite amazing he did everything he could tried every oldest trick in the book to freak me out and give me the runaround you know how i deal with people like that simple i ignore it i justignone it if he wants to play around and threaten and screech and shovel in five hundred and seventeen subclauses that he thinks hes going to catch me out on thats ok hes just taking up time but so what ive got time ive got plenty of time for people like mr rag because you know what the really crazy thing is you know whats really crazy the guy cannot draw up an actual contract to save his life really to savehislife and i tell you something thats fine by me he can thrash around and spit all he likes when he gets tired i just reel him in listen i draw up contracts in the recond business these guys are just minnows by comparison theyre primitive savages youve met them youve dealt with them theyre primitive savages well arent they like the red indians they dont even know what theyve got you know these people are lucky they didnt meet some real shark i mean it you know what america cost you know what the whole united states of america actually cost you dont and neither do i and shall i tell you why the sum is so negligible that someone could tell us what it was and two minutes later we would have forgotten it would have gone clean out of our minds now compared with that let me tell you i am providing i am really providing a private suite in the woodshead hospital lavish attention food sensational quantities of linen sensational you could practically buy the united states of america at todays prices for what thats all costing but you know what i said if he wants the linen let him have the linen just let him have it its fine the guys earned it he can have all the linenhewants just dont fuck with me is all now let me tell you this guy has a nice life a nice life and i think thats what we all want isnt it a nice life this guy certainly did and he didnt know how to have it none of these guys did theyre just kind of helpless in the modern world its kind of tough for them and im just trying to help out let me tell you how na ve they are and i mean na ve my wife cynthia youve met her and let me tell you she is the best i tell you my relationship with cynthia is so good i dont want to hear about your relationship with your wife ok thats fine thats absolutely fine i just think maybe its worth you getting to know a few things but whatever you want is fine ok cynthias in advertising you know that she is a senior partner in a major agency major they did some big campaign really big a few years back in which some actor is playing a god in this commercial and hes endorsing something i dont know a soft drink you know tooth rot for kids and odin at this time is just a down and out hes living on the streets he simply cant get anything together because hes just not for this world all that power but he doesnt know how to make it work for him here today now heres the crazy part odin sees this commercial on the television and he thinks to himself hey i could do that im a god he thinks maybe he could get paid for being in a commercial and you know what that would be pays even less than the united states of america cost you follow me think about it odin the chief and fount of all the power of all of the norse gods thinks he might be able to get paid for being in a television commercial to sell soft drinks and this guy this god literally goes out and tries to find someone wholl let him in a tv commercial pathetically na ve but also greedy lets not forget greedy anyway he happens to come to cynthias attention shes just a lowly account executive at the time doesnt pay any attention thinks hes just a whacko but then she gets kind of fascinated by how odd he is and i get to see him and you know what it dawns on us hes for real the guy is for real a real actual god with the whole panoply of divine powers and not only a god but like the main one the one all the others depend on for their power and he wants to be in a commercial lets just say the word again shall we a commercial the idea was dumbfounding didnt the guy know what he had didnt he realise what his power could get him apparently not i have to tell you this was the most astounding moment in our lives astounding let me tell you cynthia and i have always known that we were well special people and that something special would happen to us and here it was something special but look were not greedy we dont want all that power all that wealth and i mean were looking at the world here the wholefuckingworld we could own the world if we wanted to but who wants to own the world think of the trouble we dont even want huge wealth all those lawyers accountants to deal with and let me tell you im a layer ok so you can hire people to look after your lawyers and accountants for you but who are those people going to be just more lawyers and accountants and you know we dont even want the responsibility for it all its too much so then i have this idea its like you buy a big property and then you sell on what you dont want that way you get what you want and a lot of other people get what they want only they get it through you and they feel a little obligated to you and they remember who they got it through because they sign a piece of paper which says how obligated they feel to you and money flows back to pay for our mr odins very very very expensive private medical care so we dont have much mr gently one or two modestly nice houses one or two modestly nice cars we have a very nice life very very nice indeed we dont need much because anything we need is always made available to us its taken care of all we demanded and it was a very reasonable demand in the circumstances was that we didnt want to know any more about it we take our modest requirements and we bow out we want nothing more than absolute peace and absolute quiet and a nice life because cynthias sometimes a little nervous ok and then what happens this morning right on our own doorstep pow its disgusting i mean it is really a disgusting little number and you know how it happened heres how it happened its our friend mr rag again and hes tried to be a clever tricky little voodoo lawyer its so pathetic he has fun trying to waste my time with all his little tricks and games and runarounds and then he tries to faze me by presenting me with a bill for his time thats nothing its work creation all lawyers do it ok so i say ill take your bill ill take it i dont care what it is you give me your bill and ill see its taken care of its ok so he gives it to me its only later i see its got this tricky kind of subtotal thing in it so what hes trying to be clever hes given me a hot potato listen the record business is full of hot potatoes you just get them taken care of there are always people happy to take care of things for you when they want to make their way up the ladder if theyre worthy of their place on the ladder well theyll get it taken care of in return you get a hot potato you pass it on i passed it on listen there were a lot of people who are very happy to get things taken care of for me hey you know it was really funny seeing how far and how fast that particular potato got passed on that told me a lot about who was bright and who was not but then it lands up in my back garden and thats a penalty clause job im afraid the woodshead stuff is a very expensive little number and i think your clients may have blown it on that particular score we have the whip hand here we can just cancel this whole thing believe me i have everything i could possibly want now but listen mr gently i think you understand my position weve been pretty frank with each other and ive felt good about that there are certain sensitivities involved of course and im also in a position to be able to make a lot of things happen so perhaps we can come to any one of a number of possible accommodations anything you want mr gently it can be made to happen just to see you dead mr draycott said dirk gently just to see you dead well fuck you too dirk gently turned and left the room and went to tell his new client that he thought they might have a problem chapter a tittle while later a darkblue bmvv pulled quietly nway fran the otherwise deserted forecourt of st pancras stadon and moved off up the quiet streets somewhat dejected dirk gently put on his hat and left his newly acquired and newly relinquished client who said that he wished to be alone now and maybe turn into a rat or something like some other people he could mention he closed the great doors behind him and walked slowly out on to the balcony overlooking the great vaulted hall of gods and heroes valhalla he arrived just as the last few stragglers of the revels were fading away presumably to emerge at the same moment in the great vaulted train shed of st pancras station he stayed staring for a while at the empty hall in which the bonfires now were just fading embers it then took the very slightest flicker of his head for him to perform the same transition himself and he found himself standing in a gusty and dishevelled corridor of the empty midland grand hotel out in the great dark concourse of st pancras station he saw again the last stragglers from valhalla shuffling away and out into the cold streets of london to find benches that were designed not to be slept on and to try to sleep on them he sighed and tried to find his way out of the derelict hotel a task that proved more difficult than he anticipated as immense and as dark and as labyrinthine as it was he found at last the great winding gothic staircase which led all the way down to the huge arches of the entrance lobby decorated with carvings of dragons and griffins and heavy ornamental ironwork the main front entrance was locked as it had been for years and eventually dirk found his way down a side corridor to an exit manned by a great sweaty splodge of a man who guarded it at night he demanded to know how dirk had gained entrance to the hotel and refused to be satisfied by any of his explanations in the end he had simply to allow dirk to leave since there was little else he could do dirk crossed from this entrance to the entrance into the station booking hall and then into the station itself for a while he simply stood there looking around and then he left via the main station entrance and descended the steps which led down on to the st pancras road as he emerged on to the street he was so surprised not to be instantly swooped upon by a passing eagle that he tripped and stumbled and was run over by the first of the early mornings motorcycle couriers chapter with a huge crash thor surged through the wall at the far end of the great hall of valhalla and stood ready to proclaim to the assembled gods and heroes that he had finally managed to break through to norway and had found a copy of the contract odin had signed buried deep in the side of a mountain but he couldnt because theyd all gone and there was no one there theres no one here he said to kate releasing her from his huge grip theyve all gone he slumped in disappointment wh said kate well try the old mans chambers said thor and hurled his hammer up to the balcony with themselves in tow he stalked through the great chambers ignoring kates pleas protests and general abuse he wasnt there hes here somewhere said thor angrily trailing his hammer behind him well go through the world divide he said and took hold of kate again they flicked themselves through they were in a large bedroom suite in the hotel litter and scraps of rotting carpet covered the floors the windows were grimy with years of neglect pigeon droppings were everywhere and the peeling paintwork made it look as if several small families of starfish had exploded on the walls thene was an abandoned trolleybed in the middle of the floor in which an old man lay in beautifully laundered linen weeping from his one remaining eye i found the contract you bastard raged thor waving it at him i found the deal you did you sold all our power toto a lawyer and aan advertiser and and all sorts of other people you stole our power you couldnt steal all of mine because im too strong but you kept me bewildered and confused and made bad things happen every time i got angry you prevented me getting back home to norway by every method you could because you knew id find this you and that poison dwarf toe rag youve been abusing and humiliating me for years and yes yes we know all that said odin wellgood thor said kate well ive shaken all that off now shouted thor yes i see i went somewhere i could get good and angry in pence when i knew youd be otherwise occupied and expecting me to be here and i had a hell of a good shout and blew things up a bit and im all right now and im going to tear this up for a start he ripped right through

territory to the northeast of valhalla a network of paths that seemed to lead only to other paths and then back to the first paths again for another try went two figures one a big stupid violent creature with green eyes and a scythe which hung from its belt and often seriously impeded its progress the other a small crazed creature who clung on to the back of the bigger one manically urging him on white actuaily impeding his progress still further they attained at last a long low smelly building into which they hurried shouting for horses the old stable master came forward recognised them and having heard already of their disgrace was at first disinclined to help them on their way the scythe flashed through the air and the stable masters head started upwards in surprise while his body took an affronted step backwards swayed uncertainly and then for lack of any further instructions to the contrary keeled over backwards in its own time his head bounded into the hay his assailants hurriedly lashed up two horses to a cart and clattered away out of the stable yard and along the broader thoroughfare which led upwards to the north they made rapid progress up the road for a mile toe rag urging the horses on frantically with a long and cruel whip after a few minutes however the horses began to slow down and to look about them uneasily toe rag lashed them all the harder but they became more anxious still then suddenly lost all control and reared in terror turning over the cart and tipping its occupants out on the ground from which they instantly sprang up in a rage toe rag screamed at the terrified horses and then out of the corner of his eye caught sight of what had so disturbed them it wasnt so terrifying it was just a large white metal box upturned on a pile of rubbish by the roadside and rattling itself the horses were rearing and trying to bolt away from the big white rattling thing but they were impossibly entangled in their traces they were only working themselves up into a thrashing lather of panic toe rag quickly realised that there would be no calming them until the box was dealt with whatever it is he screeched at the greeneyed creature kill it greeneye unhooked his scythe from his belt once more and clambered up the pile of rubbish to where the box was rattling he kicked it and it only rattled the more he got his foot behind it and with a heavy thrust shoved it away down the heap the big white box slithered a foot or so then turned over and toppled to the ground it rested there for a moment and then a door finally freed flew open the horses screamed in fear toe rag and his greeneyed thug approached the thing with worried curiosity then staggered back in horror as a great and powerful new god erupted from its innards chapter the following afternoon at a comfortable distance from ali these events set at a comfortable distance from a well proportioned window through which the afternoon light was streaming lay an elderly oneeyed man in a white bed a newspaper sat like a halfcollapsed tent on the floor where it had been hurled two minutes before the man was awake but not glad to be his exquisitely frail hands lay slightly curled on the pure white linen sheets and quivered very faintly his name was variously given as mr odwin or wodin or odin he was is a god and furthermore he was a confused and startled god he was confused and startled because of the report he had just been reading on the front page of the newspaper which was that another god had been cutting loose and making a nuisance of himself it didnt say so in so many words of course it merely described what had happened last night when a missing jet fighter aircraft had mysteriously erupted under full power from out of a house in north london into which it could not conceivably have been thought to have fitted it had instantly lost its wings and gone into a screaming dive and crashed and exploded in a main road the pilot had managed to eject during the few seconds he had had in the air and had landed shaken bruised but otherwise unharmed and babbling about strange men with hammers flying over the north sea luckily because of the time at which the inexplicable disaster had occurred the roads were almost deserted and apart from massive damage to property the only fatalities to have occurred were the as yet unidentified occupants of a car which was thought to have been possibly a bmw and possibly blue though because of the rather extreme nature of the accidcnt it was rather hard to tell he was very very tired and did not want to think about it did not want to think about last night did not want to think of anything other than linen sheets and how wonderful it was when sister bailey patted them down around him as she had just now just five minutes ago and again just ten minutes before that the american girl kate something came into his room he wished she would just let him sleep she was going on about something being all fixed up she congratulated him on having extremely high blood pressure high cholesterol levels and a very dicky heart as a consequence of which the hospital would be very glad to accept him as a lifelong patient in return for his entire estate they didnt even care to know what his estate was worth because it would clearly be sufficient to cover a stay as brief as his was likely to be she seemed to expect him to be pleased so he nodded amiably thanked her vaguely and drifted drifted happily off to sleep chapter the same afternoon dirk gently awake also in hospital suffering from mild concussion scrapes and bruises and a broken leg he had had the greatest difficulty in explaining on admittance that most of his injuries had been caused by a small boy and an eagle and that really being run over by a motorcycle courier was a relatively restful experience since it mostly involved lying down a lot and not being swooped on every two minutes he was kept under sedation in other words he slept for most of the morning suffering terrible dreams in which toe rag and a greeneyed scythebearing giant made their escape to the northeast from valhalla where they were unexpectedly accosted and consumed by a newly created immense guilt god which had finally escaped from what looked suspiciously like an upturned refrigerator on a skip he was relieved to be woken at last from this by a cheery oh its you is it you nicked my book he opened his eyes and was greeted by the sight of sally mills the girl he had been violently accosted by the previous day in the caf for no better reason than that he had prior to nicking her book nicked her coffee well im glad to see you took my advice and came in to have your nose properly attended to she said as she fussed around him pretty roundabout way you seem to have taken but youre here and thats the main thing you caught up with the girl you were interested in did you oddly enough youre in the very bed that she was in if you see her again perhaps you could give her this pizza which she arranged to have delivered before checking herself out its all cold now but the courier did insist that she was very adamant it should be delivered i dont mind you nicking the book really though i dont know why i buy them really theyre not very good only everyone always does dont they somebody told me theres a rumour he had entered into a pact with the devil or something i think thats nonsense though i did hear another story about him which i much preferred apparently hes always having these mysterious deliveries of chickens to his hotel rooms and no one dares to ask why or even guess what it is he wants them for because nobody ever sees a single scrap of them again well i met somebody who knows exactly what he wants them for the somebody i met once had the job of secretly smuggling the chickens straight back out of his rooms again what howard belt gets out of it is a reputation for being a very strange and demonic man and everybody buys his books nice work if you can get it is what i say anyway i expect you dont want to have me nattering to you alt afternoon and even if you do ive got better things to do sister says youll probably be discharged this evening so you can go to your own home and sleep in your own bed which im sure youll much prefer anyway hope you feel better heres a couple of newspapers dirk took the papers glad to be left alone at last he first turned to see what the great zaganza had to say about his day the great zaganza said you are very fat and stupid and persistently wear a ridiculous hat which you should be ashamed of he grunted slightly to himself about this and turned to the horoscope in the other paper it said today is a day to enjoy home comforts yes he thought he would be glad to get back home he was still strangely relieved about getting rid of his old fridge looked forwand to enjoying a new phase of fridge ownership with the spanking new model currently sitting in his kitchen at home then was the eagle to think about but he would worry about that later when he got home he turned to the front page to see if there was any interesting news
