vesstil shuttlecraft pilot for straha wuppah smallgroup commander chicago the fleetlord atvar had convened a great many meetings of his shiplords since the races conquest fleet came to tosev quite a few of those meetings had been imperfectly happy the tosevites were far more numerous and far more technically advanced than the race had imagined when the conquest fleet set out from home but atvar had never imagined calling a meeting like this he used one eye turret to watch his leading officers as they gathered in the great hall of his bannership theth emperor hetto the other eye turret swiveled down to review the images and documents he would be presenting to those officers kirel shiplord of theth emperor hetto and a staunch ally stood beside him on the podium to him atvar murmured giving a good odor to what happened in the sssr wont be easy one of kirels eye turrets swung toward a hologram of the tall cloud rising from the nuclear explosion that had haltedworse had vaporizedthe races drive on moskva exalted fleetlord the odor is anything but good he said we knew the big uglies were engaged in nuclear research yes but we did not expect any of their little empires and notempiresespecially the sssrto develop and deploy a bomb so soon especially the sssr atvar agreed heavily thesoyuz sovietskikh sotsialesticheskikh respublik sent a frisson of horror through any rightthinking male of the race a short span of years before its people had not only overthrown their emperor but killed him and all his family such a crime was literally unimaginable back on home where emperors had ruled the race for a hundred thousand years among the big uglies though impericide seemed stunningly common the gastight doors to the great hall hissed closed that meant all the shiplords were here atvar knew it but was still less than eager to begin the meeting at last kirel had to prompt him exalted fleetlord yes yes atvar said with a hissing sigh he turned on the podium microphones spoke to the males waiting impatiently in their seats assembled shiplords you are already aware i am certain of the reason for which i have summoned you here today he touched a button two images sprang into being behind him the first of a brilliant point of light northeast of the soviet city of kaluga captured by an observation satellite then that groundlevel shot of the cloud created by the sssrs atomic bomb the shiplords no doubt had already seen the images tens of times all the same hisses of dismay and fury rose from every throat the tailstumps of several males quivered so hard with rage that they could not stay in their seats but had to stand until their tempers eased assembled shiplords we have taken a heavy blow atvar said not only did this explosion take with it many brave males and a large quantity of irreplaceable landcruisers and other combat equipment it also moved our war against the big uglies into a new phase one whose outcomes are not easily foreseen to the race few words could have been more ominous careful planning leaving nothing to chance was not only inherent in the temperament of most males but inculcated in all from hatchlinghood the race had sent a probe to tosev sixteen hundred years before only half so many of this planets slow revolution around its star decided it was worth having and methodically begun to prepare but for those preparations little in the races threeworld empire had changed in that time the big uglies meanwhile had gone from riding animals and swinging swords to riding jet aircraft launching shortrange missiles using radio and now to atomic weapons the races savants would be millennia investigating and explaining how a species could move forward so fast neither the race itself nor its subjects the hallessi and the rabotevs had ever shown such a pattern to them change came in slow tiny meticulously considered steps atvar unfortunately did not have millennia to investigate the way the big uglies worked circumstances forced him to act on their time scale and with too large a measure of their doitnow worrylater philosophy he said in this entire sorry episode i take comfort in but one thing permission to speak exalted fleetlord a male called from near the front of the hall straha shiplord of theth emperor yower next senior in the fleet after kireland no ally of atvars to atvars way of thinking he was so rash and impetuous he might as well have been a big ugly himself but at a meeting of this sort all views needed hearing speak atvar said resignedly exalted fleetlord straha used the proper deferential title but sounded anything but properly deferential exalted fleetlord how can any part of this fiasco cause you comfort some of the shiplords muttered in alarm at the harsh language straha used males of the race even those of highest rank were expected to showand to feelrespect for their superiors at all times but a disquieting number of officersand not just those of his factionseemed to agree with straha atvar said here is the comfort shiplord he used strahas title high but not supreme in the conquest fleet to remind him of his place then went on analysis shows the plutonium the sssr used in its weapon to have come from stocks stolen from us in a raid during tosev s past autumn the big uglies may be able to make a bomb if they get nuclear material but we have no evidence they can manufacture it on their own cold comfort to the thousands of males dead because you didnt think the tosevites could do even so much straha jeered shiplord you forget yourself kirel said from beside atvar sometimes a nearequal could call attention to a breach of decorum a superior might feel he had to ignore by the emperor shiplord i do not straha shouted back at the mention of his sovereign he cast down both eye turrets so he looked at the floor for a moment so did every other male in the chamber atvar included the murmurs among the shiplords grew as kirel had said strahas conduct was most out of place in a staid officers meeting but straha himself was anything but staid who exalted fleetlord led the raid in which we lost this nuclear material he demanded atvars gut knotted now he knew the direction from which straha would attack but knowing brought no comfort he tried to head off the shiplord that is not relevant to the matter before us now many males probably even most would have yielded to his authority straha though refused to be headed off it most certainlyis relevant exalted fleetlord he howled wasnt the chief big ugly male the one named skorzeny with its hisses the name might almost have belonged to a male of the race that however was not why it drew a sharp reaction from the assembled shiplords the male called skorzeny had given the race grief ever since the conquest fleet landed on tosev and straha continued as atvar had known he would exalted fleetlord along with promising us the capture of moskva at our previous meeting did you not also promise us the imminent destruction of skorzeny have we achieved either of these goals his sarcasm made the murmurs in the great hall rise to a din males shouted angrily at one another through the uproar atvar answered steadily shiplord you know we have not i assure you i find that at least as unfortunate as you do the sardonic reply did nothing to calm the shiplords it certainly did not calm straha who said instead of moskva captured we have a major force ruined instead of skorzeny dead we have the city of split lost croatia more firmly in the deutsch camp than ever and skorzeny boasting of what he did over every frequency on which the deutsche broadcast assembled shiplords i submit to you that these plans were not adequately developed he couldnt have been much more provocative if hed suggested that atvar was in the big uglies pay accusing a male of the race of bad planning was as harsh a condemnation as you could make atvar had trouble replying too for the plan on which hed relied in split had come from the mind of an operative named drefsab who despite being perhaps the best intelligence officer the race possessed wasor rather had beenaddicted to the tosevite herb ginger which could easily have clouded his judgment the fleetlord did say experience on tosev has been that plans cannot always be as immutable as we conceived them to be back on home any male who does not see this is a fool your pardon exalted fleetlord but you are the one who has failed to adapt to the conditions pertaining to this world straha said i have come to this conclusion reluctantly i assure you subordination to properly constituted authority has served the race well for tens of thousands of years but the sssrs atomic explosion and our ignominious failure at split each in its own way have shown beyond any possible doubt that our conduct of the campaign to conquer tosev has been dreadfully mishandled what would you have us do atvar said angrily throw our own atomic weapons about with reckless abandon for one thing we do not have that many to throw for another we do not know how many bombs the sssr constructed from the nuclear material it got from us for a third we also do not know how close the sssrand several other tosevite empiresare to producing nuclear materials and weapons on their own and for a fourth we cannot devastate large areas of this planet not with the colonization fleet already on its way here from home that should have made straha shut up similar arguments had many times before now though the shiplords eye turrets twisted to let him glance toward males throughout the great hallgauging his strength atvar thought for the first time alarm prickled through him could straha straha could assembled shiplords he declared i hereby submit to you that because our present exalted fleetlord by his repeated misjudgments of the big uglies and their capabilities put the success of our conquest of tosev not only at risk but in desperate peril he no longer deserves to hold the supreme rank with which the emperor entrusted him and should be replaced by another more able male he did not say who that male should be but the way he preened suggested he had at least one candidate in mind mutiny atvar exclaimed mutiny kirel echoed but not quite so promptly as atvar would have liked the fleetlord gave him a quick suspicious glance after himself kirel was the highestranking male in the fleet if he was to be deposed the shiplords might well decide they still could not stomach straha as his replacementin which case kirel might get the job it is not mutiny straha insistedand now he did not give atvar his title of respect we would be insane if we did not provide for removing a superior who has shown himself to be incompetent i have the right to request that we consider such a removal at this time he was technically correct he did have that right but to use itprominent males who were removed from their posts got into the races history not only as object lessons for later generations but also because they were so rare atvar wanted fame from this mission not notoriety he said assembled shiplords the right of which straha speaks pertains to males who have gone mad under the stress of their work or suffered some other mental debilitation if we contemplated removing every male who ever met a reverse we would soon have few males left to do anything that is the ordinary standard i admit straha shot back but the ordinary assignment does not carry such a burden of responsibility if a transport planner back on home fails goods may be delivered late to the annoyance of those who receive them if the fleetlord fails here however our conquest of this planet fails with him less ineptitude is tolerable from him than from a male of lower rank shiplords commanded their inferior and obeyed the fleetlord they seldom found themselves in a gathering of equals and even more seldom in a gathering of equals where they were called upon to decide something both vital and highly irregular the race shied away from irregularity wherever it could one more thing that left it illprepared for a world as regularly irregular as tosev because the males had little practice at debate they werent very good at it strahas supporters shouted and hissed at those who backed atvar and the fleetlords followers returned the compliment they displayed their rows of pointed teeth shoved one another and generally behaved more like new hatchlings than staid males of respectable years quietly kirel said exalted fleetlord the rule in such cases is that threefourths of the males in the rank immediately inferior to that in question must concur that its present holder is incompetent to remain at his post by the emperor i am not incompetent atvar raged i did not for a moment assert that you were exalted fleetlord kirel said but the question has been put in proper form and now must be decided atvars suspicions doubled then doubled again but formality trapped him he knew the rules for deciding the matter though hed never really expected to have to use them very well shiplord he said hating every word since you are next senior to me but were not personally involved in raising the question i yield control of the meeting to you until it is settled be assured i shall appeal to the emperor any action taken against me of course exalted fleetlord kirel said politely although he atvar and all the assembled shiplords knew the warning was meaningless back on home an appeal to the emperor would be heard promptly on rabotev and halless the emperors viceroys performed that duty but from here a radio signal would take more than ten even of tosev s long years to reach home while another ten of them would pass awaiting a reply effectively atvar was the emperors viceroy on tosev or would be if he retained his post making no effort to hide his anger he stepped away from the podium rather nervously kirel said assembled shiplords we are gathered now in the most solemn proceeding known to the race we may answer the question of the exalted fleetlords fitness to continue in office in one of two ways either each male may enter an anonymous yes or no at his seat the result to be displayed electronically here or we may publicly record each shiplords name and choice how say you he knows the rule very well to bring it out so patatvar thought had kirel been loyal to him or simply more cautious than straha atvar would have to contemplate that if he remained in any position to act on the results of his contemplation straha said let it be done anonymously superior shiplord that way should the question failhe did not sound as if he expected it tothe exalted fleetlord will not be in a position to take vengeance on those who questioned his competence youll get more support that way too from males who would be ashamed to condemn me openlyatvar thought in a way though that reassured him had straha been certain of his backing he would have asked for a public record of namesand no matter that the choice is anonymous straha ill remember what youvedone kirel waited for any males who so desired to insist on a public record when none did he said very well assembled shiplords register your choices when the tally is complete i shall announce the result atvar did his best to look impassive no matter how he writhed inside being subjected to this tribunal of his inferiors was humiliating it was worse than humiliating in fact it reminded him of the way some of the big ugly notempires tried to run their affairs the race had expected had intended to bring civilization to tosev instead the tosevites seemed to be barbarizing not only the shiplords but all the males of the conquest fleet time stretched after what seemed like forever kirel said assembled shiplords i shall now announce your decision atvar stayed outwardly unconcerned or tried to straha leaned forward in eager anticipation the great hall grew as still as atvar had ever known it not a male wished to miss the result assembled shiplords kirel said those favoring the removal of the fleetlord atvar from his post constitute sixtynine percent of your number those favoring his retention constitute thirtyone percent this fails to be a threefourths majority he turned to atvar command us exalted fleetlord atvar walked back to the podium he looked out at the assembled shiplords and they back at himcommand us kirel had said even with the races traditions of obedience could he command these males when two out of three of them had declared he was not fit to do so he would have to find out and how was he supposed to treat the big uglies now that they could do serious damage not only to the race but also to their precious planet before negotiations had either been about smallscale procedural matters like treatment and exchange of prisoners or over terms of surrender to the race now hed have to find that out too vyacheslav molotov hated flying he reckoned going in a drafty biplane to germany and then on a later air trip to england among the worst experiences of his life but flying in a humanmade airplane however appalling that was paled to insignificance beside taking off in a lizard rocket ship to zoom up into outer space to talk with the commander of the imperialist aggressors from the stars hed done that once before so this time hed known what to expect the acceleration that pushed him back against the toosmall padded seat and squeezed the air from his lungs the sudden moment of transition after which he seemed to weigh nothing at all and had to control his stomach as rigidly as he always controlled his face the saharalike temperatures the lizards found comfortable hed prepared for that at least wearing a light cotton suit instead of his usual thick wool even so he was still sweating as he faced the fleetlord atvar a couple of small drops had escaped from his forehead and floated around the chamber in which he the leader of the lizards and a lizard interpreter hung at various improbable angles the lizards took their weightlessness utterly for granted so he tried his best to do the same atvar spoke several sentences in the lizards language of hisses pops and clicks the interpreter turned them into russian the exalted fleetlord says you were most rash to use an atomic bomb against the race when we could turn so many of these weapons against you molotov had told stalin the same thinghad in fact argued harder against using the atomic bomb than hed dared argue with stalin about anything else for years but stalin had overruled him and no rain of destruction had fallen on the soviet unionyet instead the lizards had summoned him here to confer maybe that meant stalin was right all along such thoughts ran through the foreign commissars mind as he asked the interpreter to repeat a couple of things he hadnt quite understood his face remained expressionless he nodded to the interpreter to show hed caught the gist this time the lizard was much more fluent than he had been on molotovs previous trip to this immense spacecraft not quite a year before tell the exalted fleetlord the race was rash to attack the peaceloving peasants and workers of the soviet union molotov answered perhaps the means we used to repel you will show you how true this is perhaps atvar said through the interpreter and then again vyacheslav mikhailovich perhaps not we know you made this bomb with the quantity of element you stole from us do not try to deny it our analysis leaves no room for doubt when will you be able to produce bombs altogether on your own if you renew your treacherous attacks on us i assure you that you will find out and that the answer will not please you molotov said without hesitation again his features showed nothing of the fear he felt the true answer to that question wason the order of three years if the lizards learned the true answer the soviet union was hideously vulnerable to them his prompt reply seemed to give atvar pause he was relieved to see that and even more relieved when the fleetlord partially changed the subject do you not realize you destroy your own planet when you use atomic weapons that did not stop you when you bombed berlin and washington molotov retorted why did you think it would concern us and if you win this imperialist war against mankind earth will no longer beour planet in any case of course we shall use all our weapons to resist you this course can lead only to your own destruction atvar said i think you may be rightbut molotovs demeanor would not have shown his wife what he was thinking let alone a lizard he said we know you have enslaved two races already and want us to become the third we know you have kept those other races under subjection for thousands of years and that you plot the same fate for us since all this is true and since you have not even tried to deny it is true how can destroying ourselves be worse you would keep your lives some of your private property atvar began even stonefaced as he normally was even in the lizards power even floating in hideously unfamiliar weightlessness molotov burst out laughing it took him by surprise it also seemed to take the lizard fleetlord and his interpreter by surprise molotov said there is no private property in the soviet union private property is the result of theft the state owns the means of production atvar and the interpreter went back and forth in their own language for a little while when they were done the interpreter swiveled his eyes back toward molotov and said the full meaning of the concept you describe escapes us i understand that molotov answered it is because the class struggle in your society has not progressed to the point where the dialectic of the transition from capitalism to socialism is above your mental horizon as best he could the translator rendered that into the lizards language the fleetlord atvar made a noise that might well have come from the safety valve of a powerful steam engine through the interpreter he said you dare you presume tosevite to call therace primitive his mouth fell open in a lizard laugh in your system of social organization certainly molotov said despite the confidence with which he imbued his voice he felt the paradox for the lizards technical achievements were anything but primitive the soviets called them imperialists but he did not think they were out to conquer the earth for the sake of developing new markets as highly advanced capitalist states had done in the past few generations to delay the inevitable proletarian revolution the lizards society seemed more like that of the ancient empires with masters ruling slaves and exploiting their labor but the economic system of the ancient empires had been assumed to be incompatible with developing advanced technology marxistleninist theoreticians were still hammering out where the lizards fit into the historical dialectic atvar was laughing at him again perhaps for his presumption the fleetlord said well we care nothing for what you tosevites think of our arrangements and i did not summon you here to discuss them you have made this war more dangerous for us i do not deny that but you have also made it more dangerous for yourselves if you think we will hold back from responding in kind you are badly mistaken that was not our concern molotov answeredthat was not stalins concern anyhow we shall do what we think best depending on the circumstances in which we find ourselves withdraw your forces from the soviet union and you will be in no more danger from us atvar laughed again not molotov thought pleasantly this cannot be i show my mercy by not treating you as a criminal since your rulers came to power through murdering your emperor the fleetlord and the translator both showed what looked like genuine revulsion the version atvar gave of what had happened in the soviet union wasnt strictly accurate but molotov didnt argue the niceties with him the bolsheviks had done what they had to do to stay in power to do anything less would have been to betray the workers and common soldiers and sailors who had helped them overthrow their class enemies in the kerensky regime aloud molotov said one day when you have advanced sufficiently you will do the same if the two lizards had been revolted before now they were furious again they made noises that reminded molotov of a samovar boiling with the fire too high atvar spat words the interpreter proved his fluency had improved by turning them into precise insulting russian you big uglies are the most uncultured odious creatures anyone could ever have imagined and you soviets the most uncultured and odious of the big uglies to suggest such a thing atvar started bubbling and sputtering again molotov took no notice of the insults but in weightlessness his glasses kept trying to escape from his nose when he had secured them he said we do not love one another this much i already knew did you summon me here merely to remind me of it or did you have serious diplomatic proposals to put to me he granted atvar a moment of professional respect when the fleetlord did return to business i summoned you here to warn you that under no circumstances will we tolerate any further use of nuclear weapons by any tosevite empire and that we reserve the right to retaliate as we see fit i can speak only for the soviet union whose peaceloving workers and peasants must of course reject demands made at gunpoint molotov answered we also reserve the right to retaliate as we see fit especially since your forces invaded our land without reason or declaration of war i can predict though that other nations will respond similarly other empires atvar let that hang in the air for a few seconds before resuming other tosevite empires are also working on nuclear weapons of this we are certain how can you be assured that they will use these weapons against us rather than you the deutsche for instance are already developing rockets which could carry them molotov almost betrayed himself by bursting into laughter again the lizard was trying to sow rivalry among his human enemies which would have been far from the worst of ploys if he hadnt been so obviousand so badat the game even ribbentrop would have seen through it before you came germany and the soviet union were enemies true molotov said germany and the united states were enemies germany and great britain were enemies japan and great britain were enemies japan and the united states were enemies we are enemies among ourselves no moreyou are more dangerous to all of us than we were to one another for once diplomacy and truth came together men fought each other on more or less even terms the lizards were far ahead of all human nations go under to them and you would never come up again even hitler wretched madman that he was recognized the truth there atvar said surely you realize this struggle is futile for you class struggle is the engine of the historical dialectic molotov answered it is never futile i understand these words one by one vyacheslav mikhailovich but not their full meaning together the interpreter said how shall i render them for the exalted fleetlord tell him we shall go on fighting come what may and that we shall use whatever weapons we have to destroy his forces within the soviet union molotov said no threats he can make will keep us from defending ourselves the translator hissed and popped and squeaked and atvar hissed and popped and squeaked back the translator said you will regret this decision i would regret any other decision more molotov replied that was true in an immediate personal sense if he dared step so much as a centimeter outside the limits stalin had set for him the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union would have him shot and worry afterwards no more than if hed trimmed a fingernail but it was also true in the wider way in which hed intended it surrender to the lizards meant longterm slavery not just for the soviet union but for the human race like any true believer molotov was certain the historical dialectic would one day produce a proletarian revolution among the lizards given what scraps he knew of their history though he was not prepared for mankind to wait the thousands of years the dialectic was liable to take brigadier general leslie groves had a sign over his desk in the science hall at the university of denver do it anyhow he scrawled his signature on a report and got up from the desk a big gingerhaired man with a big belly and enough driving energy for any three ordinary mortals that energy and a gift for organization that went with it had made him a firstrate military engineer and led to his being put in charge of americas effort to build an atomic bomb as groves put on his cap he glanced back at the sign hed used all his impressive energy to make sure the united states built the first humanmade atomic bomb only to be beaten by the russians of all people that wounded his pride losing the race to the germans would have been a catastrophe had the lizards not come under the present circumstances though it wouldnt have surprised himthe germans were the ones whod discovered nuclear fission after all but the russians the russians he muttered to himself as he tramped down the hall unfair advantages the russians and germans had split a load of plutonium theyd captured from the lizards not far from kiev thanks to polish jews whod intercepted their courier the germans had had to split their half again the american metallurgical laboratory physicists had the half the germans had been forced to disgorge neither that half nor what the germans bad left was enough by itself to make a bomb if the russians had kept as much as the germans had started out with though theyd had plenty all right so they didnt do it all by themselves groves said that theyd done it ahead of the united states in any way shape form color or size still rankled no matter how much the bomb theyd used had helped the war effort against the lizards it rankled more people than groves too ever since the russian bomb went off the denver papers bad been screaming that the usa should have been the first country to blow the lizards to hell and gone none of the reporters and editorial writers had shown that he knew his atoms from third base and none of them thank god seemed to have a clue that the met lab was operating out of the university of denver these days on his way from science hall to the football stadium that housed the atomic pile the physicists had built groves passed a sergeant leading a couple of lizard pows the man and the aliens were almost friends by now they chatted in a mixture of english and the lizards language morning general the sergeant said saluting superior sir the two lizards added in their hissing english morning yeager groves returned the salute he even grudged the lizards a nod ullhass ristin as individuals they looked strange but not particularly dangerous they were about the size and build of skinny tenyearolds with scaly greenbrown skins their bodies leaned forward slightly at the hips and had stubby little tails to balance that their fingers and toes bore claws rather than nails they had forwardthrusting muzzles filled with lots of small sharp teeth and long tongues theyd stick out like snakes their eyes were like a chameleons on independently rotating turrets so they could look in two directions at the same time no mere humans had ever put the united states in such deadly danger though groves tramped on science hall was near the north end of the campus a long way away from the stadium the walk helped keep his weight down so did the short rations everybody was on these days he was a long way from skinny even so had things been a little different he would have looked like one of the blimps the navy flew or more likely had flown out of lakehurst new jersey outside the football stadium a guard saluted groves who noted approvingly that the fellow was under cover so he couldnt be spotted from the air one of the keys to the american atomic bomb project was not letting the lizards know it existed it was shadowy under the stadium but not cool during the day denver was like a bake oven in summer even though the milehigh air shed heat fast at night the physicists and technicians in charge of the pile nodded as groves approached they didnt necessarily love him but they took him seriously which sufficed how much closer are we he asked enrico fermi we have gained another day the physicist answered the output of plutonium from this pile does continue to increase not fast enough groves growled the pile produced grams of plutonium per day the united states needed several kilograms of the stuff to add to what they received from inside the soviet union by way of a reluctant german courier the jewish irregulars in poland and a british submarine groves had shepherded that plutonium all the way from boston to denver only to be told when he got it here that he hadnt brought enough the memory still rankled fermi shrugged a large latin shrug general i cannot change the laws of nature i can learn to apply them more efficiently and this i try to do this is how we gain time on the date i first predicted but to increase production to any really great degree we need to build more piles that is all there is to it thats not going fast enough either groves said another pile was going up under the stands at the opposite end of the football field they had plenty of uranium oxide for it getting the superpure graphite they needed was another matter groves was an expediter supreme but the transportation snarl into which the lizards had thrown the united states was more than enough to drive even expediters mad what we really need is to build piles of more efficient design fermi said the hanford site on the columbia would be idealfar more water for cooling than we can take from the south platte an area far removed from the lizards im not so sure of that groves broke in theyre supposed to have a base in idaho only a couple of hundred miles off to the east a small one fermi pinched his thumb and forefinger together to show how small as soon as professor larssen returns to confirm that the site is as good as it appears to be we will begin centering more and more of our activities there as soon as larssen gets back yeah groves said with a marked lack of enthusiasm as far as he was concerned jens larssen could stay away indefinitely yeah sure the guy had a beef hed been away from the met lab crew for a long time on a dangerous mission any crosscountry travel counted as a dangerous mission these days and his wife figuring he had to be dead had fallen for sergeant sam yeagerhed been a corporal thenmarried him and got pregnant when larssen turned out to be alive after all shed decided to stay with yeager none of that was calculated to improve a mans attitude but goddamn it you couldnt let how you felt drag down your work the way larssen had it wasnt just his own work that had been hurting either hed been taking his colleagues minds off what they were supposed to be doing too groves hadnt been sorry to see him volunteer to scout out hanford washington and would hold in his delight at seeing him come back professor larssen has had a difficult time fermi said reacting to the dislike in groves voice professor fermi the whole countryhell the whole worldhas had a difficult time groves retorted its not like hes the only one hed better stop whimpering and pull himself together he leaned toward fermi using his physical presence to make his point for him he wasnt that much taller than the italian but he was wider and harder and tougher to boot fermi said if you will excuse me general i have some calculations i must attend to and hurried away groves grunted scoring a victory against a mildmannered physics prof was like shooting fish in a barrelyeah youd done it but so what when youd cut your teeth on hard cases you barely even noticed biting down on a fermi and besides you couldnt bite down too hard on fermi without false modesty groves knew he was very good at what he did there werent a whole lot of people who were both the engineer and administrator he was but if he dropped dead tomorrow george marshall would pick somebody just about as good to replace him who was just about as good as a nobel prizewinning physicist in a word nobody the bombs would be built he had no doubt of that first the one that incorporated the plutonium stolen from the lizards then others made entirely with humanproduced nuclear material the knowhow and resources were in place the united states merely had to await results only trouble was the united states couldnt wait as things stood that first bomb was a year away maybe more how much of the states would be left in american hands by the time it was ready to blownot enough groves thought gloomily the guys with the guns and the tanks and the airplanes were doing all they could but all they could was liable not to be enough that meant every day he could shave off getting the first bomb ready was a day that might save the country nobody in the united states had faced that weight of responsibility since the civil war he shrugged his broad shoulders he had to hope they were strong enough to bear the burden ristin threw a baseball to sam yeager the lizard pow handled the ball as if it were a grenade but he threw pretty straight the ball slapped leather in yeagers beatup glove good toss he said and threw the baseball on to ullhass ullhass mitt was even more battered than yeagers but that wasnt his problem he lunged at the ball with the glove as if he were trying to push it away rather than catch it not surprisingly he didnt catch it stupid eggaddled thing he said in his own language as he stooped to pick the ball up off the grass and added the emphatic cough to show he really meant it yeager felt a surge of pride at how automatically he understood what the lizard was saying he wasnt any big brain hed had his third stripe only a few days he hadnt been a prof before the lizards came either hed been an outfielder for the decatur commodores of the class b threei league the only reason the draft hadnt grabbed him was that he wore full dentures uppers and lowers a souvenir of the influenza epidemic that had almost killed him and had left him so weak and debilitated that his teeth rotted in his head but prof or no hed been an avid reader ofastounding and the other sciencefiction pulps after the lizards came the army didnt care any more whether you had teeth all they worried about was a pulseif you had one you were in so when his unit captured some lizards back in illinois hed volunteered to try to communicate with the things and here he was in denver working hand in hand not only with the aliens but also with the high foreheads who were taking what ullhass and ristin knew and using it to help build an atomic bomb for the usanot bad for an overage ballplayer he thought ullhass threw the baseball to ristin ristin was a better natural athlete than the other lizard or maybe just smarter hed figured out how to catch with a glove anyhow let the ball come to him then close his meat hand over it to make sure it didnt get out he still threw funny though sam had to jump high to catch his next fling sorry superior sir ristin said dont worry about it nobodys keeping score yeager brushed back into place a lock of dark blond hair that had escaped from under the foreandaft army cap he wore he threw ullhass the ball but for the nature of his friends it was an allamerican scene three guys playing catch on a college campus on a bright summers day you didnt get any more norman rockwell than thatexcept norman rockwell had never painted a lizard with a baseball glove just to add to thesaturday evening post quality of the scene here came barbara sam waved and grinned enormously partly because he was always glad to see her and partly because she was wearing the calico blouse and blue jeans in which shed married him up in the great metropolis of chugwater by god wyoming even for yeager who in seventeen years of pro ball thought hed seen every small town in the us of a that had been a new one he wondered how long shed be able to keep wearing those jeans not that they didnt look good on hershe was a little on the lean side but she definitely had hips and a pert posteriorbut her pregnancy was just beginning to show with her clothes off as best as he could tell theyd started junior their wedding night hi honey he said as she drew near whats up the question came out more seriously than hed expected she wasnt smiling as she usually did general groves sent me out to find you himself she answered youve got new orders he said new orders sam pulled a face i was just thinking how much i liked what i was doing here did he say what they were barbara shook her head her hair a couple of shades darker than his flew around her head i asked him but he wouldnt tell me he said he wanted to give them to you in person i dont like the sound of that yeager said any time a general gave a sergeant orders in person something out of the ordinary was going on maybe something liable to get the sergeant killed but if general groves wanted to see him he couldnt very well say no he turned to ullhass and ristin speaking in the mix of english and lizard he usually used with them come on boys lets go see what the exalted projectlord wants with me ristins mouth fell open in a lizardy chuckle youre a funny big ugly superior sir he used the lizards slang name for people as unselfconsciously as sam saidlizard instead ofmale of the race around him the two humans and two lizards strolled across the university of denver campus toward science hall a couple of times people they knew waved to them ullhass and ristin waved back as casually as barbara and sam did they were an accepted part of the met lab staff by now technically they remained prisoners but nobody worried much about their trying to escape groves was a big enough wheel to rate a guard outside his office the same guard whod been assigned to jens larssen for a while yeager didnt hold that against him morning oscar he said you want to keep an eye on these two tough guys while the general tells me whatever he tells me try to keep em from stealing all our secrets here sure sam oscar answered even without his rifle yeager would have bet on him against ristin and ullhass both dark and quiet he might be but hed seen nasty action somewherehe had the look now he nodded to barbara morning maam good morning oscar she answered she spoke more precisely than sam did hell she spoke more precisely than most people did shed been a graduate student in medieval english out at berkeley before the war that was where shed met jens oscar turned back to sam go on in general groves hes expecting you okay thanks yeager turned the doorknob feeling the same willies hed had whenever a manager called to him in a certain tone of voice after a gameoh god he thoughtwhere have they gone and traded me to now he went through the door closed it after him general groves looked up from the notes he was scribbling on a typed report sam came to attention and saluted sergeant samuel yeager reporting as ordered sir he said formally at ease yeager youre not in trouble groves said returning the salute he waved to the chair in front of his desk sit down if you care to when sam had groves went on is it your opinion that weve wrung just about everything your two scaly accomplices know about nuclear physics out of them yes sir id say thats probably true yeager answered after a moments thought good id have thrown you out of here on your ear if youd tried to tell me anything else groves said by the way the muscles shifted in his big shoulders hed meant it literally the united states can still learn a lot about the lizards from ullhass and ristin though even if what we learn has nothing directly to do with the metallurgical laboratory wouldnt you agree with that no doubt about it sir yeager said the more we know about the lizards the better theyll still be around from now on even if we manage to beat them and thats not counting this colonization fleet of theirs its due inwhat twenty years thats about right yes general groves looked intently across the desk at sam the way you answered that last question convinced me these are absolutely the right orders for you you casually came to the same conclusion a staff of government experts has needed months to reach probably comes from reading science fictionyeager thought he didnt say that out loud he had no idea how groves felt about that buck rogers stuff he did say you havent told me what the orders are sir so i havent groves glanced down at some papers behind hisin basket that yeager couldnt see weve established a center for interrogation and research on lizard pows down in arkansas im going to send ristin and ullhass there and im ordering you to accompany them i think you can best serve your country by using your rapport with the lizards and thats the place for you to do it yes sir sam said hed been traded all right but to a place he didnt mind going assuming he could get there uh sir what sort of transportation will we have theres a lot of lizards between here and arkansas that arent prisoners if you know what i mean i know exactly what you mean nevertheless youll fly groves answered sir yeager did his best to keep the surpriseto say nothing of the dismayhe felt from showing his best he feared was none too good he figured hed better explain they shoot down an awful lot of our planes sir that would do for an understatement until a better one came along the lizards aircraft had the same sort of advantage against the planes the americans flew as a lightning or a warhawk would have against a world war ivintage sopwith camel but groves nodded his big head and said youll fly anyhowand whats more the lizards will know youre coming yeager must have looked as if hed just been smacked in the kisser with a large carp for the general chuckled a little before continuing we always inform them before we move prisoners by air and we paint the planes we fly them in bright yellow its worked pretty well they dont like shooting at their own people any more than we would oh yeager said i guess thats okay then and if there were no such arrangement between lizards and men and groves had told him to fly anyway hed have damn well flown thats what the army was about as it was though he asked do you think its safe enough for my wife to come along sir really im not just asking for the sake of having her with me she knows just about as much about the lizards as i do shed be useful at this arkansas place at least until she has her baby under normal circumstances sergeant id say no groves answered he grimaced i dont think theres any such thing as normal circumstances any more as you say your barbara may be useful in arkansas but thats not why im going to tell you yes frankly sergeant getting you and her out of here will simplify matters when professor larssen gets back from washington state yes sir sam said woodenly groves had to think like that though jens larssen was a talented nuclear physicist and the general was running a project to build an atomic bomb if he could help the lizard prisoner research project at the same timetwo birds with one stone ran through yeagers mind when do we leave sir he asked not for a few days groves answered we need to make the arrangements and be sure theyre understood written orders will go out to you as soon as one of the secretaries gets around to typing them dismissed yeager stood saluted and left he wasnt sure groves even saw the salute hed already gotten back to work on the report hed been scribbling on when sam came in barbara ullhass and ristin all took a couple of steps toward him when he came out into the hallway you look green sam she said what happened in there pack your bags hon he answered were moving to arkansas she stared and stared he had to remind himself that shed never been traded before heinrich jager stuck his head and torso up through the open cupola of his panzer v for a look around then ducked back down into the turret of the panzer lord it feels good to have some centimeters of steel all the way around me again he said his gunner a veteran sergeant named klaus meinecke grunted at that colonel you dont seem to have done too bad while you were out on your own either he pointed to the knights cross of the iron cross that jager wore at his collar jagers hand went to the medal hed earned it for helping otto skorzeny take the town of split on the adriatic back from the lizards he said sergeant i was in the infantry during the last war i thought one round of that had cured me forever just goes to show you may get older but you dont get smarter meinecke laughed as if hed told a joke but jager meant every word of it fighting from building to building inside the great stone walls of diocletians palace had been every bit as appalling as trench warfare in france a quarter of a century before the alsatian town of rouffach through which the panther had rumbled a few minutes before had been part of the germanreich during world war i taken from france after the francoprussian war france had taken it back after the first world war now it was german again for as long as thereich could maintain itself against the lizards jager stood up in the cupola again looked back over his shoulder the spires of rouffachs church of notre dame still loomed against the sky so did what the locals called the witches tower crowned by a huge disorderly storks nest pretty country he said lowering himself once more klaus meinecke grunted i wouldnt know all i get to see of it is a gunsights worth except when we stop for the night he smacked his lips they make good wine around here though ill give them that much that they do jager said they didnt do badly farther south either he wouldnt let himself venture any more in the way of reproach than that when hed left the panzer forces in the west to head for croatia theyd had the lizards stopped in their tracks between besancon and belfort since then belfort had fallen and mulhouse too the lizards had pushed all the way up to the rhineif id been here jager thought and then shook his head almost certainly the same thing would have happened he knew he was a damn fine panzer officer he also knew he wasnt a panzer geniusand even a panzer genius might not have held the lizards once they got rolling maybe we can push them out of mulhouse again he said hopefully thats what they said wed do back in colmar anyhow meinecke answered he was a veteran all right he understood that what they said and what actually happened could be two very different animals he pursed his lips then added quietly as if afraid of being overheard by malignant fate engines been behaving pretty well knock wood he made a fist and tapped it against the side of his own head lets hope it keeps up jager agreed rushed into production the panther could be balky among other things fuel pump problems plagued it but it was a great step forward from earlier german panzers boasting a highvelocity mm gun and thick wellsloped armor borrowed in concept from that of the soviet t all of which meant you only had to be foolhardy to go up against the lizards in a panther as opposed to clinically insane which was about what opposing them in a panzer iii had required wish we had one of those bombs the russians used to blow the lizards to hell and gone meinecke said when do you suppose well get one of our own damned if i know jager said i wish to god i did if you dont who does the gunner asked now jager just grunted by way of reply he wasnt supposed to say anything about that to anybody hed been part of the band of raiders that had stolen explosive metal from the lizards in russialike prometheus stealing fire from the godssaid the part of him that back before world war i had planned on becoming a classical archaeologist hed taken germanys share of the material across poland on horseback only to have half of it hijacked by jewish fighters there only luck they didnt kill me and take it allhe thought in russia and then in poland hed learned what thereich had done to the jews whod fallen into their hands it made him sick so he understood why the polish jews had risen in favor of the lizards and against their german overlords hed also been involved in the german physicists efforts to build an atomic pile at hechingen although again luckily hed been in combat in eastern france when the pile went out of control somehow and killed off a good many physicists including werner heisenberg how long the program would take to recover was anyones guess meanwhile the unglamorous infantry and panzer troops would have to keep the lizards from overrunning thevaterland if they didnt the high foreheads would never get the chance to finish their research and make something that would goboom in hechingen jager had felt useless hed been too ignorant to contribute properly now he was back to doing what he did best off to one side of the road an artillery piece barked then another and another eightyeights jager said identifying them by the report thats good meinecke understood him without any more discussion than that so they can fire their salvo and then get the hell out of there you mean right the first time sergeant theyre easy to shift to a new firing positiona lot easier than the bigger guns jager paused meditatively and lizard counterbattery fire is better than anything we ever dreamt of isnt that the sad and sorry truth sir meinecke agreed with a mournful sigh they can drive nails into your coffin from halfway round the world seems like sometimes if there were more of them and if they had the doctrine to go with all their fancy equipment the likes of us would have been dead for quite a while now jager finished for him meinecke laughed though again the colonel had spoken nothing but the truth down lower in the turret wolfgang eschenbach the loader laughed too he was a big blond farm boy getting more than half a dozen words out of him in the course of a day was just this side of miraculous for all their good points s had drawbacks too they couldnt fire shells as heavy as the larger guns and they couldnt throw the shells they did fire as far that meant well probably see action in the next few kilometers jager said bumping up against whatever the artillery boys are shooting at you mean sir meinecke said at jagers nod he went on makes sense to me besides south of rouffach is where they told us wed start running into the enemy isnt it they have to be right once in a while your confidence in the high command does you credit sergeant jager said dryly which set the gunner and the loader to laughing again i just hope the lizards use the same kind of flank guards we did when we got stretched thin fighting the russians hows thatherr oberst meinecke asked me i was playing games with the tommies in the desert before they stuck me in the flying circus here when panther and tiger panzers started rolling off the assembly lines thewehrmacht put only the best crewmen into them you you didnt miss a thing jager said mimicking his gunners diction but sometimes wed have to concentrate our german troops at theschwerpunkt the decisive place and cover our flanks with romanians or hungarians or italians god save us wolfgang eschenbach used up half his daily quota of speech they werent the worst soldiers ive ever seen jager said they might not have been bad at all if they were decently equipped but sometimes the russians managed to hit them instead of us and it got pretty ugly im hoping the lizards are concentrating all their best troops up where theyre trying to advance id just as soon not have to fight the first team all the time amen to that eschenbach said jager confidently expected him to fall silent till the morning the colonel stood up in the cupola again that was a good way to get shot but it was also far and away the best way to see what was going on and if you didnt know what was going on you had no business commanding a panzer let alone a rather battered regiment of them slamming the lid down and peering through the periscopes made you feel safer but it also made you miss things that were liable to get you killed northbound shells whistled overhead undoubtedly the lizards response to the germans s jager hoped the artillerymen had moved their pieces elsewhere before the shells came down on them the countryside began to have the look of a land at war wrecked and burned farm buildings smashed trees bloated dead animals shell craters pocking fields jager clucked sadly at the charred wreck of a german halftrack the panther rolled past trenches and foxholes that showed the earlier limits of the german push to the south stooping to get down into the turret for a moment jager said were moving forward anyhow against the lizards that was no small novelty and boosted his hopes that they had only secondline troops on their flanks like a jackinthebox he popped up out of the cupola again through the rasping roar of the panthers big maybach engine came the rattle of smallarms fire ahead a couple of german mgs were in action their rapid rate of fire unmistakablethey sounded as if a giant were ripping enormous bolts of thick tough cloth between his hands jager was glad the german infantry had the machine guns since all lizard foot soldiers carried automatic weapons the poorlandsers needed all the help they could get the german panzers deployed for action moving into their blunt wedge formation two companies forward jagers command panzer and another company in the middle to support them and a fourth company in the rear as a reserve they chewed brown muddy lines through the green of growing crops without warning a streak of fire lanced through the air toward a panzer iv in one of the lead companies new panzer ivs had longbarreled mm guns almost as good as the ones panthers carried but their armor though thicker than in the earlier models wasnt excellent protection even against terrestrial foes against a lizard antipanzer rocket the armor might as well not have been there at all the panzer iv brewed up orange flame billowing and a column of thick black smoke mounting swiftly into the air confused angry shouts filled the radio jager grabbed the headset shoved the earphones into place and shouted orders into the microphone the nearest surviving panzer poured machinegun fire into the thick clump of bushes from which the antipanzer rocket had come hoping to flush out or knock down the lizards who had fired it nothing without armor could have survived that hail of bullets from more than four hundred meters farther to the rear jager watched the bushes writhe under it as if under torture but a moment later another rocket incinerated a german panzer theyve got one of their troop carriers in there jager shouted into the microphone give em your main armament unlike german halftracks the lizards armored troop carriers bore light cannon that could chew up anything this side of a panzer and carried those rockets on turret rails to either side of the cannon with them the troop carriers became deadly dangerous panzer killers but while they were formidably armed they were only lightly armored they could withstand smallarms fire but when a panzer shell came knocking they opened up the german panzer hit the brakes to fire into that stand of bushes moments later the bushes went up in flames as part of the troop carriers funeral pyre jager whooped like a red indian he remembered all too well the bad days of the summer before when killing any lizard armored vehicle seemed to require divine intervention hed done it himself once with the mm cannon of a panzer iii but he didnt pretend hed been anything but lucky yet another rocket streaked out from cover and smote a panzer iv the rocket exploded in a ball of flame but the panzer did not brew up jager whooped again theschurzen work he shouted to the world at large the hollowcharge warheads of the lizards antipanzer rockets sent a jet of whitehot flame through armor and into a panzer some bright engineer had figured out that mm platesskirts he called themwelded onto a panzers turret and sides would make the rocket warhead go off prematurely and dissipate that jet now jager saw that the bright idea actually worked in combat the advancing german panzers kept on spraying the lizard infantry positions with machinegun bullets covered by that german infantrymen ran forward too the only opposing fire came from small arms jagers hopes rose if the lizards didnt have any panzers in this sector thewehrmacht really could make some gains he hadnt taken the brass seriously when they talked about getting mulhouse back and cutting the lizards off from the rhine but he was starting to think that just might happen then three lizard helicopters popped up from behind cover two from out of clearings in the woods and the third from behind a barn jagers mouth went dry helicopters were deadlier foes than panzers they launched two rockets each one blew a hole in the ground the other five hit german panzers two of the machines survived but the other three went up in flames a couple of crewmen managed to bail out of escape hatches most perished then mm rapidfire antiaircraft guns started hammering at the helicopters on the raid that captured the plutonium from the lizards the germans whod joined with the russian partisans had carried a mountain version of one of those guns which broke down into manportable loads now thewehrmacht made a habit of posting the light guns as far forward as possible to hold helicopters at bay the tactic worked the helicopters sheered away from the antiaircraft guns one of them was trailing smoke though it kept flying jager prayed for it to fall from the sky but it refused the two lead panzer companies were already through what had been the lizards front line they hadnt cleared up all the holdouts a bullet cracked past jagers head and several more ricocheted off the panther like any sensible soldiers the lizards were trying to pick off the panzer commanders for the time being jager ducked down into the panther turret were driving them he said fixing his eyes to the periscopes that gave him vision even when buttoned up with luck maybe we can push far enough to get in among their artillery and do them some real harm just then a lizard troop carrier that had lain low opened up with a rocket and took out a panzer less than a hundred meters from jagers by luck he was looking through the periscope that showed where the rocket had come from panzer halt he shouted and then armorpiercing armorpiercing wolfgang eschenbach had a dispensation to exceed his daily word quota if in the line of duty grunting a little he lifted a blacktipped shell and set it in the breech of the panthers cannon bearing three hundred degrees range seven hundred meters maybe a little less jager said the turret slewed anticlockwise i see him sir klaus meinecke said behind those bushesja thats the one jager said fire at before he could say will meinecke fired with the turret closed the noise was bearable but recoil rocked the panther the shell casing leaped out of the breech eschenbach had to move smartly to keep it from mashing his toes the acrid reek of burnt cordite filled the air hit jager yelled hit got him in one klaus forward that to the driver stopped the panther was hideously vulnerable to enemy fire the maybach bellowed the panzer leaped ahead the advance went on captain rance auerbach led his cavalry company out of syracuse kansas heading east along the north bank of the arkansas river toward garden city somewhere before he got there he expected to run into the lizards people in syracuse waved to him and his command like him they were up with the sun most of them were heading out to their farms god bless you boys a man in overalls called give em hell somebody else said two people said be careful well do our best auerbach said brushing the brim of his hat with the forefinger of his right hand he was a big rawboned man years out in the open in all weather had tanned and lined his long face till he looked a good deal older than his actual thirtytwo that was true of most of the farmers too but amid their flat kansas accents his texas drawl stood out like a bobcat in a pack of coyotes his secondincommand lieutenant bill magruder came out of virginia and had a softer version of a southern accent sot of hate to leave a nice little town like this he remarked it is pretty isnt it auerbach said syracuse boasted a cool green profusion of poplars willows and other trees on this stretch of the great plains there wasnt much like it folks drove from miles around to relax under those trees or rather folks had driven in the days before the lizards came your grandfather ride this way during the states war magruder asked two of my greatgrandfathers were texas cavalrymen sure enough auerbach answered one of em did some fighting in the indian territorywhats oklahoma nowand up in missouri so i reckon he went through kansas a time or two but probably not this far west wasnt anything here to speak of back then mm youre likely right magruder said they rode on a while in silence punctuated only by the occasional jingle of harness and the steady clopping of their horses hooves a little to the north us paralleled the arkansas but bare ground was easier on the horses feet and legs than the asphalt would have been every few hundred yards a dead car or a clump of them sat on or alongside the highway some had just run out of gas with no hope for getting more the lizards had strafed others in the early days of their invasion back when their fighter planes roamed everywhere and shot up everything farther east along the road there would be dead tanks too the great plains were wonderful country for armor too bad the lizards had the wonderful armor to take advantage of the terrain or maybe its not too bad auerbach murmured leaning forward to pat the side of his geldings neck otherwise youd be out of a job and id be just another grease monkey the horse snorted softly auerbach patted it again if you sent cavalry charging tanks the way the poles had against the nazis in youd get yourself killed but you wouldnt accomplish anything else but if you used your horses to take you to places farther and faster than infantry could go and if you made sure the garrisons you raided werent big ones you could still do some useful things you know we arent really cavalry not the way jeb stuart would have used the word auerbach said i know were dragoons magruder answered calmly if anything ever rattled him he didnt let it show on the outside we use the horses to get from here to there then get down and fight on foot jeb stuart might not have done things that way but bedford forrest sure as hell did hed have done better if hed had our firepower too auerbach said every trooper with an m except for the boys with bars a couple of nice light browning a machine guns and a mortar on our packhorses give em to forrest and wed all be singin dixie instead of the starspangled banner if forrest had em the damnyankees wouldve had em too magruder said itd just ratchet the slaughter up a notch without doin anything else much seems to me right now im not much worried about what we sing for the national anthem as long as its not the song the lizards use to that auerbach could only nod the company rode past the ruins of fort aubrey about four miles east of syracuse after the civil war the army had used it as a base from which to fight indians there hadnt been any fighting in these parts since there was now high overhead a westbound lizard airplane scribed a white contrail straight as if drawn by a draftsman across the blue skya blueprint for somebody catching hellauerbach thought the deadly roar of the planes jet engines came down to the ground as a thin attenuated whisper bill magruder shook his fist at the flying silver speck auerbach understood that only too well he said im just glad its not after us yes sir magruder said theyd both been through assaults by groundattack aircraft those chewed up horse cavalry as bad as tanks did helicopters were even worse they didnt just make strafing runs and leave they stayed around and hunted you no matter which way you ran if cavalry flew instead of riding it would be mounted on helicopters auerbach turned his head to follow the lizard plane as it disappeared into the west these days i cant help wondering what those sons of bitches carry he said i keep worrying its another one of those bombs like the one they used on washington or the russians used on them south of moscow once the gloves for that kind of fight come off how do you put em back on again damned if i know magruder answered i just wish to jesus we had some of those bombs ourselves you think we can make em i sure hope so auerbach answered he thought back to the knapsack that colonelwhat was his name groves that was ithad toted from boston all the way to denver complete with a detour into canada hed commanded the company that had escorted groves on the crosscountry jaunt he didnt know for sure what was in that knapsack groves had been mighty tightlipped about the whole business like any good officer but if it wasnt something to do with one of those fancy bombs auerbach figured his guesser needed repairing he didnt say anything about that to magruder who hadnt been with the company then if groves couldnt talk to him about it he didnt figure he could talk to anybody else the company rode into kendall twelve miles east of syracuse a couple of hours before noon if syracuse had been a small town kendall was a dusty hamlet dozing by the arkansas river auerbach let the horses rest crop some grass and drink from the river he walked into the general store to see if it had anything worth getting but the kendallians had pretty much picked it clean over the past year they were living on whatever they got from their farms the way their grandparents and greatgrandparents had just after the war between the states when the company left kendall auerbach ordered a couple of scouts with radios well forward he knew the lizards were in garden city forty miles east he didnt think they were in lakin fifteen miles east he didnt want to find out he was wrong the hard way he also ordered the men to spread out wide even if the worst happenedthe worst being attack from the airsome of them should escape one minute one hour melted into another sweat dripped from the end of auerbachs pointed nose soaked the armpits of his khaki jacket he took off his hat and fanned himself with it it didnt help much just as if the world remained at peace windmills spun pumping water up from underground to nourish wheat and corn and sugar beets almost every farm had a big brooder house every so often auerbach would hear chickens clucking cows and sheep cropped grass while pigs wandered around eating anything that wasnt nailed down even though shipping had gone to the devil here no less than anywhere else people still ate pretty well the company approached lakin in the late afternoon auerbach didnt mind that at all if the town did hold lizards theyd have the sun in their eyes when fighting started sir the radioman brought his horse up next to auerbachs henry and red they say theyve spotted razor wire like the lizards use theyre dismounting and theyll wait for us right auerbach reined in and got out a pair of binoculars he didnt see any razor wire but the scouts were a lot closer than he was far and away the biggest set of buildings ahead looked at first distant glance like military barracks auerbach turned the binoculars on them whereupon he laughed at himselfthey let him read the words painted in big letters on the side of one building which saidkearny county consolidated high school he turned back to the radioman tell em were on our way yes sir the radioman spoke into the microphone horse holders auerbach called hoping the sunwould keep the lizards in lakin from noticing him and his men if it didnt that could prove embarrassingmaybe fatally embarrassing in the states war one man in four had held horses while the others went up to fight on foot auerbachs company was already about ten men understrength he couldnt afford to lose any more effectives than he could help letting one man hold five horses also let the company bring four or five extra weapons to the front some of the horse holders resented the duty he had to rotate it through all the troopers to make it seem fair some though looked just as well pleased not to be going up against the firepower the lizards could throw at them he pretended not to notice that nobody had to be a hero all the time he wondered how big a garrison the lizards had thrown into lakin they hadnt been there long how well could they have fortified the place he was bringing about seventy men with him if they were going up against a battalion theyd get slaughtered but why in gods name would the lizards stick a battalion into a godforsaken place like lakin kansas he hoped he wouldnt find out the company advanced at the best pace the crews for the machine guns and mortar could manage they were the ones weighed down by their guns and ammunition auerbach would have liked to approach lakin closer on horseback but that was asking to get chewed up here on the plains they could see you coming from a long way off about a mile outside of town the mortar crew set up shop a little bit closer red and henry had tied their horses to fence posts redhis last name was oneillpointed ahead see that sir theyve got a perimeter out around the school mmhmm auerbach studied it wire yeah and firing pits too i dont see anybody in em though no sir oneill agreed theyre there all right but they dont look like theyre expecting company which may mean they arent and which may mean theyre laying for us auerbach rubbed his chin bristles rasped under his fingers he was getting scruffy enough to make a good states war trooper that was for sure he sighed i think we better find out nobody argued but then nobody would he was the captain the fellow who got paid to make the choices he wished someone would have tried to talk him out of this one instead the men fanned out and started moving in on the consolidated high school at his murmured orders one of the machinegun crews went straight toward it while the other circled around to the left away from the arkansas river auerbach went straight in too with every step he took he wished kansas wasnt so blinking flat he felt like a bug on a plate walking toward a man with a fly swatter the size of dallas before long he wasnt walking any more he was crawling on his belly through the grass something moved inside the perimeter ahead auerbach froze somebody fired as if that were a signal the whole company opened up some of the high schools windows had been broken before abruptly just about all of them were the lizards wasted no time shooting back they had machine guns on the roofs of several high school buildings auerbach blew air out through his lips making a snuffling noise amazingly like one a horse might produce this wasnt going to be anything like a walkover a mortar bomb whistled through the air landing about fifty yards short of the school buildings another round flew over the high schoolbracketed auerbach thought then bombs started falling on the buildings one of the rooftop machine guns suddenly fell silent auerbach yelled himself hoarse after about fifteen rounds the mortar stopped shooting that was painfully developed doctrine if you kept banging away from the same place too long the lizards would get you besides they were going to be calling in air support any minute now you didnt want to lose artillery even a little old mortar if they couldnt find you they couldnt shoot you one of the high school buildings had caught fire lizards skittered out of it auerbach drew a bead on one fired the lizard sprawled on the ragged grass and lay there kicking auerbach shot at another one to no visible effect he swore some of his men had got into lakin itself so fire came at the consolidated high school from three sides of a ring auerbach pricked up his earssome of the weapons firing from that direction werent regulation army issue that meant the locals had joined in the fight auerbach wanted to pound his head against the dirt of the shallow foxhole hed scraped out for himself the cavalry was going to have to get the hell out in a couple of minutes did the lakinites or whatever they called themselves think the lizards would give them a big kiss on the cheek for trying to make like soldiers he turned to the radioman call our boys in town and tell em to get out tell em to bring out as many of the townies with guns as they can he laughed those folks dont know it yet but they just joined the army several of his troopers had joined in the same highly informal way if you were willing to put your neck on the line to fight the lizards uncle sam was more than willing to give you a chance to do it by the numbers when firing in lakin began to die down auerbach also ordered his troops on the left to pull back now he used his machine guns to cover the retreat and keep the lizards from getting too enthusiastic about pursuit the troopers had made a lot of raids on lizardheld small towns they knew the drill you wanted to get back to your horses and scatter before the lizards brought in their planes and helicopters and splattered you all over the landscape you could tell at a glance the new fish the troopers were bringing out of lakin and uniforms or their absence had next to nothing to do with it the civilians whod taken up arms against the lizards didnt know how to take cover they didnt know how to move they hesitated before doing what somebody told them about what youd expect from three or four farmers in bib overalls and two girls auerbach did a double take sure as hell a couple of young women totings were trotting back with his soldiers one of them wore overalls too the other was in a dress he played back in his head the orders hed given the radioman hed saidtownies he hadnt saidmen if the troopers claimed they were just following orders theyd have a point oh for gods sake he muttered that sort of thing had happened before but like anybody he hadnt expected it to happen to him he hoped the girls could ride hed have horses for them hed seen a couple of his men go down companions were helping others along there were the horses in a little hollow that shielded them from being spotted from the high school the mortar was already broken down and packed away here came the machine gun crews the a had been developed especially for cavalry with the weapons came light metal fittings that attached to the standard pack saddle and carried gun tripod a spare parts chest a spare barrel and three small ammunition chests getting everything ready for travel took bare moments auerbach turned to the civilians whod taken up arms against the lizards can you ride people even in farm country like this it wasnt a given the way it would have been a generation before but nobody said no for which he was duly grateful the newcomers gave their names as they mountedor in a couple of cases clambered ontothe horses of cavalrymen who wouldnt need them any more what anybody called lorenzo farquhar was doing in lakin kansas was beyond auerbach but it wasnt his business either the woman in overalls was named penny summers her father wendell was there too the other one was rachel hines she said ive wanted to shoot those things ever since they came here thanks for giving me the chance though she showed a lot of leg mounting she swung into the saddle as smoothly as any of the men when everyone was horsed auerbach said now we scatter you new people pick a trooper and stick close to him rendezvous point is lamar colorado see you there in a couple of days lets ride scattering was the best way to make sure attack from the air didnt wipe out your whole command some of the troops galloped off to the north some to the south toward the arkansas some straight off to the west auerbach headed northwest himself to be in the middle of things when the air attacks came not that he could do anything about them but his job was to try penny summers and her dad rode with him they werent horsefolk like his troopers but they kept upand everyone was going flat out too hearing a swelling roar in the air behind him he roweled his gelding with his spurs wringing out of it every ounce of speed it had a hammering noise rang through the roar as if gods jalopy had developed a knock the damage was done in the few seconds before the fighter plane screamed overhead close enough for auerbach to see the seams and rivets on the underside of its fuselage cannon shells chewed up the ground around the fleeing cavalrymen a fragment tore his trouser leg and drew a bleeding line on the side of his calf he looked around as the plane streaked off after other targets one of his troopers was down dead so was wendell summers it looked as if one shell had got him and another his horse auerbach gulped even for war it was ugly penny summers had reined in staring in numb astonishment at the red smears and badly butchered meat that had been her father get moving auerbach shouted at her you want to end up just like him weve got to get out of here buthes dead she said disbelievingly as if such things couldnt happen as if this were peaceful rather than its a chance you take shooting back at the lizards auerbach answered he wanted to be gentle but he didnt have time look miss we cant hang around that plane may be back for another pass you know her eyes were green but white showed all around their irises she was he guessed somewhere in her middle twenties but shock left her face so blank she looked years younger but if she didnt pull herself together at least well enough to ride that horse in the next ten seconds he was damn well going to leave her here she did she was still stunned but she booted the horse in the ribs and got rolling auerbach rode alongside her when he had the time hed grieve for his lost men too not now now getting away was all that mattered if that stinking jet hadnt chewed up the rest of the company too badly he might even have won himself a minor victory ussmak said if they keep pulling us out of the line how do they expect us to maintain the advance against the deutsche nejas let out a hissing sigh i am but a landcruiser commander ussmak just as you are but a driver and skoob here but a gunner i do not make these decisions but i am a male of the race i obey yes superior sir ussmak sighed too but quietly highranking males made decisions lowerranking ones obeyed them and paid the price two landcruiser commanders and one gunner with whom hed fought were dead now and another commander and gunner arrested for being ginger addictsall that in what everyone had assumed would be a walkover campaign back when males went into the coldsleep tanks while the conquest fleet still orbited home nejas and skoob were good crewmales the best hed had since his first commander and gunner they didnt know he had his own little stash of ginger stowed away under one of the flameproof mats in the drivers compartment of the landcruiser he wished hed never got the habit but when good males died around you when half your orders made no sense when you were hurt and bored and didnt look forward to more combat but knew you had no choice what were you going to do he was no fleetlord or shiplord or grand strategist of any sort but pulling the landcruisers back from the thrust theyd made struck him as stupid theyd reached an important river the locals called it the rhine and were poised to strike deep into deutschland if they could force a crossingand now this you have to give the deutsche credit he said reluctantly no matter how hard we hit them they hit back and the swissis that what the other tribes name is are like that too they dont have weapons as good as the deutsche but i know what i want to give the deutsche skoob the gunner said he pointed to the main armament of the landcruiser a thin black line against the dark blue of the night sky better that than credit if you ask me ussmak didnt argue the landcruiser was pulled off the road north of mulhouse and hadnt going back through the wrecked tosevite town been a delight parked in a meadow tosev s big moon spilled pale light on the mountains to the west but only made the closer woods seem blacker and more forbidding even by day tosev was an alien world to ussmak it was too cold to suit him while the light from the star tosev paradoxically seemed whiter and brighter than he was used to at night though the planet turned into the sort of haunted place a female might have used to frighten hatchlings everything felt unfamiliar the odors the chilly breeze brought to the scent receptors on ussmaks tongue some spicy some bland others redolent of decay were all strange to him the air itself felt heavy and wet to breathe and the soundsthe chirps and tweets and occasional snarlswere none of them like those night creatures made back on home that was one reason ussmak found them frightening another was that he could never be certain which of those night noises came from a big ugly sneaking up with the intent of doing him permanent bodily harm he said im going to get my rest while i can well probably be fighting tomorrow somewhere altogether too close for comfort the deutsche were camped with their landcruisers too waiting for tosev to rise the landcruisers themselves werent much though the new models could sting but by the way the deutsche handled them they could have served as instructors at any training center in the empire new modelsthe thought ran through his head as he slid down into the landcruiser through the drivers hatch the weapons with which the race fought on tosev were not much different from the ones theyd used to conquer the rabotevs and hallessi thousands of years before theyd been on tosev a bit more than two years only a little more than one of this planets slow turns around its sun and already the landcruisers and aircraft with which the big uglies fought them were vastly more dangerous than those theyd first met that was frightening in and of itself worse than frightening was the atomic bomb the russkis had used if the big uglies got nuclear weapons the race was liable to lose the war ussmak hadnt imagined that not when he rampaged across the plains of the sssr just after the race landed he closed the hatch after him dogged it tight nejas and skoob would sleep by the landcruiser they didnt have enough room for comfort in the turret but his seat reclined to make a fair bed he lay there for a while but sleep eluded him ever so cautiously he reached under the mat and took out a little plastic vial it was full of brownish powder he pulled off the top poured a small mound of powder into the palm of his hand and brought the hand up to his mouth his scent receptors caught the gingers spicy tang even before his tongue flicked out to lap up the powder as it made its way to his brain wellbeing flowed through him he felt wise and quick and powerful all at the same time as if he were the fleetlord and part of the fleetlords computer scrambled together but he also feltgood almost as good as he would during mating season with no females within lightyears mating hardly ever crossed his mind to the race the habits of the big uglies seemed a planetwide dirty joke when ginger coursed through him the big uglies were laughable contemptible better yet in his mind they weresmall with ginger the war looked not only winnable but easy the way everyone had thought it would be before the conquest fleet left home but ussmak had learned better than to taste just before he went into combat ginger made you think you were smart and strong but it didnt really make you smart and strong if you roared into action convinced the tosevites couldnt possibly hurt you you were all too likely to end up dead before you realized youd made a mistake tasting ginger had two other problems attached to it one was that the first thing a taste made you want was another taste ussmak knew he was an addict he fought against it as best he could but an addict he remained the other problem was what happened when you didnt take that second taste ginger didnt just lift you when it was through with you it dropped youhard and the drop seemed all the worse because of how high youd been before ussmak made himself not reach for the vial again when exhilaration faded ive done this a lot of times by now he said aloud willing himself to stillness depression and fear crashed down on him just the same he knew they werent real but they felt as real as the pleasure that had gone before them infantrymales screened the landcruisers in ussmaks worried imagination they fell asleep at their posts or simply failed to spy deutsch males creeping through what were to the race alien woods the first the crewmales would know of their blunders was satchel charges chucked at their landcruisers ussmak dozed off shivering in terror he woke with a fresh spasm of alarm when the turret hatches clanged shut but it was only nejas and skoob getting into the landcruiser i thought you were a couple of tosevites he said resentfully if we were youd be dead meat skoob retorted a short pause showed he was letting his mouth fall open in laughter lets get moving nejas said driver start the engine it shall be done superior sir the return to routine heartened ussmak however battered by fate hed been he was still a male of the race the hydrogenburning turbine caught on the first try he would have been astonished at anything else the races engineering was solid well clean up the deutsche here and then resume our advance nejas said as the landcruiser began to move a little delay wont matter ussmak wondered if hed had his tongue in the ginger jar too but no nejas and skoob had never developed the habit they were everything a male of the race should be and so unselfconscious about it that he couldnt even resent them landcruisers and troop carriers rumbled up the road together the farmland to either side had probably been fertile once but armies going back and forth across it hadnt done much to help that ruins craters and the tumbled corpses of tosevite animals were appalling ussmak didnt see any big uglies they werent too stupid to get out of the way of the war not far ahead a male in the gray sacks the deutsche wore to protect themselves from their worlds beastly climate popped up out of a concealed hole in the ground and pointed something at a troop carrier flame shot from the rear of the device a projectile rocketed toward the carrier without looking to see whether hed scored a hit the big ugly ducked back into his hole troop carriers were armored against smallarms fire but unlike landcruisers not against heavy weapons the projectile struck just below the turret the carrier burst into flames at once escape hatches popped open as its crew and the fighting males it bore tried to escape some did fire from deutsch gunners cut down others smash that tosevite nejas screamed from the intercom speaker taped to ussmaks hearing diaphragm normally a calm collected commander he sounded as furiously excitable as any gingerlicker after three tastes by contrast ussmak was coldly furious it shall be done superior sir he said grimly and steered straight for the foxhole from which the big ugly had emerged he made sure he put a tread right on it then locked that tread and turned the landcruiser in its own length crushing the deutsch male as if he were grinding an insect underfoot then he drove on its not revenge enough skoob complained it certainly isnt by the emperor nejas agreed the deutsche came out ahead in that exchange as hed been trained since hatchlinghood to do ussmak cast down his eyes at the mention of his sovereign before he could raise themwham the impact against the front of the landcruiser was like a kick in the muzzle hed been in a landcruiser that had taken shell hits back in the sssr but never one like this but the armor heldif it hadnt he wouldnt have been sitting there thinking about how hard hed just been hit commander and gunner normally went through a series of orders identifying a target and designating it for destruction this time skoob just said with your permission superior sir and fired after a tiny pause that hesitation was enough to let the deutsche fire again too wham again an impact that jolted ussmak again the shell failed to penetrate the landcruiser rocked with the round skoob fired hit ussmak shouted as flame and smoke spurted from behind bushes not even the best big ugly landcruiser gun could pierce the frontal armor of one of the races landcruisers but the reverse did not hold true forward nejas ordered ussmak gave the engine more throttle the landcruiser leaped ahead more deutsche ussmak discovered were armed with those alarming rocket projectors they killed two troop carriers that he saw and managed to set one landcruiser afire few of the males who used the projectors escaped the blast from the launchers showed just where they were and gunners sent heavy fire their waynor was ussmak the only male to take more direct measures of extermination hed almost reached a town marked on the map as rouffach when nejas ordered driver halt halting superior sir ussmak said obediently though the command puzzled him despite the antivehicle rockets theyd been driving the big uglies before them orders from the unit commander nejas said were to pull back from this position and resume our previous offensive it shall be done ussmak said as he had to say then not only because hed been through a lot of combat with a lot of crews but also because the deaths of his previous crewmales made him much more an outsider than males of the race usually became he went on that doesnt make a lot of sense superior sir even if we were beating them we havent smashed the big uglies here and by going off weve just given the deutsche by the big river a couple of days rest to strengthen their defenses they were tough enough before and theyd stay that way even if we had forced our way through some of them for a considerable time nejas did not answer him at last the landcruiser commander said driver i fear you demonstrate imperfect subordination ussmak knew he was imperfect in any number of ways that was a long way from saying he was wrong take off your clothes ttomalss said the little scaly devils chinese held a thick hissing accent but liu han was used to it and followed it without trouble she used the little devils speech in return it shall be done superior sir she wondered if ttomalss could detect the weary resignation in her voice she didnt think so the little scaly devils were interested in learning everything they could about people but only as people might be interested in learning everything they could about some new kind of pig that people might have feelings didnt seem to have occurred to them sighing liu han pulled off her black cotton tunic let her baggy trousers and linen drawers fall to the dirt floor of the hut in the refugee camp west of shanghai outside people chattered and argued and scolded children and chased chickens and ducks the marketplace lay not far away the racket that came from there was neverending like the plashing of a stream she had to make a deliberate effort to hear it ttomalss weird eyes swiveled independently as they examined her she stood still and let him look all he cared to one thing more than a years association with the little scaly devils had taught her was that they had no prurient interest in mankind not that she would have aroused prurient interest in many men not with a belly that looked as if shed swallowed a great melon whole her best guess was that the baby would come in less than a month ttomalss walked up to her and set the palm of his hand on her belly his skin was dry and scaly like a snakes but warm almost feverish against hers the little devils were hotter than people the few christians in the camp said that proved they came from the christian hell wherever they came from liu han wished theyd go back there and leave herleave everyonealone the baby kicked inside her ttomalss jerked his hand away skittering back a couple of paces with a startled hiss that is disgusting he exclaimed in chinese and added the emphatic cough liu han bowed her head yes superior sir she said what point to arguing with the scaly devil his kind came from eggs like poultry or songbirds cautiously ttomalss returned he reached out again and touched her in a very private place we have seen in your kind that the hatchlings come forth from this small opening we must examine and study the process most carefully when the event occurs it seems all but impossible it is true superior sir liu han still stood quiet enduring his hand hating him hate filled her but she had no way to let it out after the japanese overran her village and killed her husband and little son the little scaly devils had overrun the japaneseand kidnapped her the little devils had mating seasons like farm animals finding out that people didnt had repelled and fascinated them at the same time she was one of the unlucky people theyd picked to learn more about suchagain as people might explore the mating habits of pigs in essence though they didnt seem to think of it in those terms theyd turned her into a whore in a way shed been lucky one of the men theyd forced on her an american named bobby fiore had been decent enough and shed partnered with him and not had to endure any more strangers the baby kicked again hed put it in her belly but bobby fiore was dead now too hed escaped from the camp with chinese communist guerrillas somehow hed got to shanghai the scaly devils had killed him thereand brought back color photos of his corpse for her to identify ttomalss opened a folder and took out one of the astonishing photographs the little scaly devils made liu han had seen photographs in magazines before the little devils came from wherever they came from shed seen moving pictures at the cinema a few times but never had she seen photographs with such perfect colors and never had she seen photographs that showed depth this one was in color too but not in colors that seemed connected to anything in the world liu han knew bright blues reds and yellows were splashed seemingly at random over an image of a curledup infant this is a picture developed by the machinethatthinks from scans of the hatchling growing inside you ttomalss said the machinethatthinks is stupid superior sir liu han said scornfully the baby will be born with skin the color of mine except pinker and it will have a purplish patch above its buttocks that will fade in time it will not look like it rolled through a painters shop ttomalss mouth dropped open liu han couldnt tell if he was laughing at her or he thought the joke was funny he said these are not real colors the machinethatthinks uses them to show which parts of the hatchling are warmer and which cooler the machinethatthinks is stupid liu han repeated she didnt understand everything ttomalss meant by the phrase she knew that the scaly devils were pretty stupid themselves even if they were strongmaybe they needed machines to do their thinking for them thank you for showing me i will have a son before it is born she said and bowed to ttomalss how could the machinethatthinks see inside me with a kind of light you cannot see and a kind of sound you cannot hear the little devil said which left liu han no wiser than before he held out other pictures to her here are earlier pictures of the hatchling you see it looks more like you now he was right about that foolish colors aside some of the pictures hardly looked like anything human but liu han had talked with women whod miscarried and remembered them speaking of the oddly shaped lumps of flesh theyd expelled she was willing to believe ttomalss wasnt lying to her will you take more pictures now superior sir or may i dress she asked not of the hatchling but of you that we may study how your body changes as the hatchling grows inside ttomalss took out what had to be a camera although liu han had never seen one so small in a humans hands he walked all around her photographing from front back and sides then he said now you dress i see you again soon he skittered out the door he did remember to close it after himself for which liu han was duly grateful sighing she got back into her clothes other cameras hidden in the hut probably recorded that shed given up worrying about it the little scaly devils had had her under close surveillance ever since she fell into their clutches and that had grown closer yet after bobby fiore somehow managed to get out of the camp yet no matter how tight it was there were ways around it ttomalss had told her something worth knowing she took a couple of silver mex dollars from a hiding place among her pots and pans then left the hut herself a lot of people gave her a wide berth as she walked slowly down the dirt road that ran in front of the houseanyone who was so obviously involved with the little devils was not to be trusted but children didnt skip alongside her chanting running dog as they once had the market square brawled with life merchants selling pork and chicken and ducks and puppies and vegetables of every sort jade and silk and cotton baskets and pots and braziersanything they could raise or find or trade for or steal in the refugee camp women in clinging dresses with slits pasted alluring smiles on their faces and offered to show men their bodies a euphemism for prostituting themselves they didnt lack for customers liu han pitied them she knew what they had to endure she dodged a mountebank juggling knives and bowls as he strolled through the market her sidestep almost made her upset the ivory tiles of a mahjong player who made his living by matching wits against all comers and maybe by unduly clever fingers as well watch where youre going stupid woman he shouted at her bobby fiore had used a onefingered gesture to answer shouts like that he knew what it meant and the chinese didnt so he could vent his feelings without getting them angry liu han just kept walking she paused in front of a cart full of straw hats as she tried one on she said to the man behind the cart did you know the little scaly devils have a camera that can see how hot things are isnt that amazing if i cared it would be the hat seller answered in a dialect she could hardly follow the camp held people from all over china do you want to buy that hat or not after haggling for a while she walked on she talked about the camera at several other stalls and carts and bought somebok choi and a small brass pot shed wandered through half the market before she came to a poultry seller whose stand was next to that of a pig butcher she told him about the camera too while she bought some chicken feet and some necks isnt that amazing she finished a camera that can see how hot things are thatis amazing he said you think i give you that much for thirty cents mex woman you are crazy she ended up paying fortyfive cents mex for the chicken parts which was too much but she kept her temper about it with the poultry seller isnt it amazing was a code phrase that meant she had information to pass and his thatis amazing said hed understood somehowshe had no idea how and didnt want to knowhed get word to the chinese communists outside the camp she knew the little scaly devils watched her closely not only because they were interested in her pregnancy but also because of what bobby fiore had done but if she spread gossip all through the marketplace how could they figure out which person who heard it was the one who mattered she just seemed like a foolish woman chattering at random what she seemed and what she was were not one and the same as best she could she was getting her revenge having a rifle in his hands again made mordechai anielewicz feel he was doing something worth doing once more the months hed spent in the little polish town of leczna had been the most pleasant hed passed since the germans invaded in especially the romance hed had with zofia klopotowski who lived next door to the people who had taken him inbut that memory made him feel guilty not glad with a war raging all around what right did he have to take pleasure in anything back in the warsaw ghetto hed been readying an uprising against the germans when the lizards came the jews of the ghetto had risen all right against the nazis and for the lizardsand hed become head of all the jewish fighters in lizardheld poland one of the most powerful humans in all the land but the lizards while they werent interested in exterminating the jews the way the nazis had been were intent on enslaving themand the poles and the germans and the russians and everybody else joining them for the short term had helped save his people joining them for the long term would have been ruinous for all peoples so quietly hed begun working against them hed let the germans smuggle explosive metal west though he had diverted some for the british and americans hed smuggled his friend moishe russie out of the country after moishe couldnt stomach telling any more lies for the lizards on the wireless but the lizards had grown suspicious of mordechai and so here he was in the forest in dead of night with a rifle in his hands some of the partisans with him were jews some were poles a few were germans the germans still alive and fighting in poland a year after the lizards came were some very tough customers indeed somewhere up ahead an owl hooted he didnt mind that a few nights before hed heard wolves howling that had sent the hair on his arms and at the back of his neck prickling up in atavistic terror also up ahead but closer the point man for the partisan band let out a hiss everybody froze a whisper came back down the line jerzys found the highway the road from lublin up to biala podlaska was paved which by the standards of polish country roads made it worthy of that handle one of the germans in the band a hulking blonde named friedrich thumped anielewicz on the shoulder and said all right shmuel lets see how this works it worked once or something like it mordechai answered in german cleaner than thewehrmacht mans first names were plenty in the partisan band his was falseanybody who figured out who he really was might be tempted to betray him to the lizardsbut had to be jewish in spite of his unaccented german and polish languages were all very well but some things they couldnt disguise all right friedrich said we see if it works again his voice carried an implied threat but anielewicz didnt think that had anything to do with his own judaism friedrich just didnt want things to go wrong that much he still kept from his army days otherwise he didnt look much like the spitandpolish soldiers whod made life hell for the jews in warsaw and lodz and everywhere in poland a floppy hat had replaced his coalscuttle helmet he wore a fuzzy yellow beard and the bandoliers crossed over the chest of his peasant blouse gave him a fine piratical air with a grunt of relief anielewicz unstrapped the crate hed been carrying along with his knapsack some enterprising soul had stolen it from the lizards base at lublin it wasnt anything special just an ordinary lizard supply container as he carried it toward the road other partisans put in cans and jars of food some from purloined lizard stock others of human make up by the highway jerzy had thepiece de resistance a jar full of ground ginger stick it in my pocket mordechai whispered to him im not going to put it in there yet this is your play the point man whispered back as he obeyed he grinned his teeth for a moment startlingly visible you sneaky jew bastard fuck you jerzy anielewicz said but he grinned too he stepped out onto the asphalt and tipped the supply crate over sideways cans and jars rolled out of it along the surface of the road he decided that wasnt good enough he stomped on a couple of cans smashed two or three jars he stepped back considered the artistic effect and found it good the crate looked as if it had fallen off a supply lorry he took the jar of ginger from his pocket unscrewed the lid and spilled half the contents over the cans and jars still inside then he set the jar and the lid by the crate and retreated back into the woods now we set up the ambush and we wait he told jerzy the point man nodded theyre fools for not cutting the brush farther back from the sides of the road he remarked fools anielewicz said well maybe you ask me though they just dont have the manpower to do everything they need good thing too if they did theyd beat us but trying to take on the whole world spreads them thin he found a good hideyhole behind a shrubas a city boy he couldnt identify it any more closely than that he detached the bayonet from his mauser and used it to dig himself a little deeper into the soft richsmelling dirt he was too aware of how much better he could have done with a proper entrenching tool then it was lie and wait a mosquito bit him in the hand he swatted at it it or one just like it bit him on the ear somebody warned he was making too much noise another mosquito bit him he lay still lizard vehicles werent as noisy as the grunting flatulent machines the nazis used sometimes the racket from the german tanks and troop carriers was intimidating but it always told you right where they were the lizards could sneak up on you if you werent careful mordechai was careful so were the rest of the partisans the ones who hadnt been carefuland some of the ones who hadwere dead now when the faint rumble of northbound vehicles came to his ears he flattened himself against the earth to be as nearly invisible as he could the lizards had gadgets that could see in the dark like cats a personnel carrier whizzed by the artistically arranged crate without stopping so did three lorries in quick succession anielewiczs heart sank if his ambush went for nothing hed lose prestige in the band he might have been the leader of polands jewish fighters but the partisans here didnt know that as far as they were concerned he was just a new fish showing what he could do the last lorry in the convoy pulled to a stop so did the troop carrier riding shotgun for it mordechai didnt raise his head he strained to catch the noises from the highway a door on the lorry slammed his heart thumped one of the lizards was going over to investigate the crate his biggest worry was that the lizards wouldnt touch it because they were afraid it was rigged to a land mine or a grenade actually that wasnt a bad idea but mordechai was ambitious he wanted to bag more lizards than he could with such a ploy he knew the exact instant when the lizard realized the ginger was there the excited disbelieving hiss needed no translation he wanted to hiss himself with relief not all lizards were ginger tasters by any means but a lot of them were hed counted on there being at least one taster among those who investigated the spilled crate that hiss brought another male out of the lorry maybe the lizard whod made it had a radio with him for a moment later hatches on the troop carrier came down too anielewiczs lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage grin just what hed hoped for easy easy patienthe willed his comrades to hold their fire until they could do the most damage with a whole lot of luck the fighting vehicles crew would get down along with the infantry they transportedif they were smart they wouldnt but ginger tasters were more apt to be greedy than smart would they be foolish enough to forget about the heavy weapons the troop carrier bore one of the partisans couldnt stand to wait any more as soon as one man opened up everybody started shooting intent on doing the most damage to the lizards in the shortest time possible anielewicz threw his rifle to his shoulder and still prone started squeezing off shots in the direction of the crate you couldnt use aimed fire at night not unless you had gadgets like those of the lizards but if you had put enough bullets in the air that didnt matter too much hisses turned to screeches on the roadway a couple of lizards started firing back at the partisans their muzzle flashes gave the humans hidden in the woods better targets at which to aim but then the turretmounted machine gun and light cannon in the troop carrier opened up anielewicz swore first in polish then in yiddish the lizards hadnt been altogether asleep at the switch after all with that kind of fire raking the trees and bushes there was only one thing to do lets get out of here mordechai yelled and he rolled away from the road the lizards werent the only ones screeching now screams from the darkness and polish cries for the virgin said some of those sprayed bullets and shells had found targets the advantage of opening fire from close to the highway was that you were right on top of the enemy the disadvantage was that you took a long time to get away from his guns not until anielewicz scrambled behind an oak tree whose trunk was thicker than his own did he begin to feel safe firing from the road died away anielewicz didnt think the partisans had hurt the lizards so badly theyd call in air strikes this sort of warfare walked a fine line if you did too little you didnt harm the enemy if you did too much you were liable to provoke him into squashing you like a bug the lizards could do that almost anywhere in the world if they wanted to badly enough keeping them too busy in a lot of places to concentrate on any one worked fairly well mordechai was walking a line himself but not a fine one it involved fetching up against a tree with his nose stepping into a hole and twisting his ankle by luck alone not too badly and splashing through a tiny rill he discovered by the simple expedient of getting his feet wet some people moved through the woods at night silent as a lynx he sounded more like a drunken wisent he thanked god the lizards were even less woodswise that you shmuel somebody hissedjerzy yes its me anielewicz answered in polish he had no idea the other partisan was within a kilometer till he spoke well that was why jerzy walked point while he shlepped along well back in the line but the pole didnt sound angry at him that was a good scheme you had there the lizards really like sticking their snouts into that stuff dont they that they do mordechai said the ones who get hooked good theyll do just about anything for a taste of ginger and a lot of them are hookedquite a lot of them if what happened back there is any clue might as well be pussy eh friedrich stepped out from behind a tree he was twice jerzys size but just about as light on his feetand it didnt do to think him stupid either hed understood polish and answered in the same language none of which made mordechai feel easy around him i dont think they keep their brains in their pricks unlike some people i could name he said he tried to keep his tone light but wasnt sure how well he succeeded having to deal withwehrmacht men made his hackles rise if men keep brains in their pricks why do you jews make yourselves stupider by cutting some off friedrich retorted was that just raillery or did the german mean something more by it who could tell what a german had been up to in poland before the lizards came anielewicz gave it up they weresupposed to beon the same side now jerzy said come onwe go this way now mordechai was damned if he knew how jerzy could tell which way to go or for that matter which waythis way was but the pole was rarely wrongand mordechai had no idea which way he was supposed to be going he followed so did friedrich the point mans skill or instinct or whatever it was led them back to the partisans camp deep in the forest no one risked a fire even with thick tree cover overhead the lizards had too many eyes in the air they just found blankets rolled themselves in them and tried to go to sleep for anielewicz that proved impossible for one thing adrenaline still sang through him from the fight for another he wasnt used to sleeping in a blanket on the hard ground and for a third menand a few womennot lucky enough to have been guided by jerzy kept stumbling into camp all night long some of them moaned with wounds some of them couldnt sleep either he joined one of the little knots of fighters sitting in the darkness and trying to figure out how well theyd done one fellow claimed four lizards downed another twice that many it was hard to figure out the partisans losses but at least two men were known dead and four or five wounded what morning would prove remained to be seen mordechai said if we hit them this hard every time well make them know were there we can afford to trade one for one longer than they can that produced thoughtful silence then grunts he took as agreement sirens screaming airplanes roaring overhead bombs crashing down antiaircraft guns pounding maniacallymoishe russie had been through that in warsaw in when theluftwaffe methodically pounded the polish capital to pieces but this was london almost four years later with the lizards trying to finish the job the germans had started here too make it stop his son reuven cried one more wail lost in the many that filled the soho shelter we cant make it stop darling rivka russie answered it will be all right she turned to moishe she didnt speak again but her face held two words i hope he nodded back sure he bore an identical expression having to admit your powerlessness to your child was awful and being afraid you were lying when you reassured him even worse but what else could you do when you had no power and were dreadfully afraid things wouldnt be all right more bombs hit somewhere close by the mattresses strewn across the floor of the shelter jumped with the impact the outcry inside the shelter rose to a new pitch of polylingual panic along with english and the russies yiddish moishe heard catalan hindustani greek and several languages he couldnt identify soho held immigrants and refugees from all over the world reuven squealed at first moishe was afraid hed hurt himself then he realized the flickering candlelight had been enough to let his son spot the stephanopoulos twins who lived in the flat across the hall from his own reuven had no more than a handful of words in common with demetrios and constantine but that didnt keep them from being friends they started wrestling with one another when the next flight of lizard planes dropped another load of death they paid hardly any attention moishe glanced over at rivka i wish i could be so easily distracted so do i she said wearily you at least dont look like youre worried no he said surprised the beard must hide it because i am his hand went to his whiskery chin a lot of men were sporting whiskers in london these days what with shaving soap razor blades and hot water all in short supply hed worn a beard in warsaw though and felt naked when he shaved it off to escape to lodz one step ahead of the lizards after he refused to be their radio mouthpiece any more theyd captured him anyhow a few months later growing the beard again had been the one good thing about the prison into which theyd clapped him he shook his head no there had been one other good thing about that prisonthe commando raid that got him out of it the trip to england by submarine had followed immediately he peered around the shelter amazingly some people managed to sleep despite the chaos the stink of fear and stale piss was the same as hed known back in warsaw rivka said maybe that was the last wave of them alevai omaynmoishe answered fervently may it be soamen the vigor of his reply made rivka smile wishing didnt make things so worse luck but he didnt hear any more explosions either nearby or off in the distance maybe rivka was right the allclear sounded half an hour later friends and neighbors woke the men and women whod slept in spite of everything people slowly went back above ground to head back to their homesand to discover whether they had homes to head back to it was about as dark on the street as it had been inside the shelter the sky was overcast the only light came from fires flickering here and there moishe had seen that in warsaw too fire engines screamed through the streets toward the worst of the blazes i hope the lizards didnt wreck too many mains moishe said theyll need all the water pressure they can get i just hope our block of flats is still standing rivka said they turned the corner oh thank god it is her voice changed timbre get away from there reuven thats broken glassyou could cut yourself a woman lay groaning in front of the apartment building moishe hurried over to her hed been a medical student when the war started and used what hed learned in the warsaw ghettonot that all the medical training in the world did any good when people were starving to death my leg my leg the woman moaned russie was just starting to learn english so that didnt mean much to him but the way she clutched at the injured part and the way the shin bent where it had no business bending told him everything he needed to know doctor he said hed made sure he learned that word he pointed to himself it wasnt quite true but he was the closest thing to a doctor the poor woman would see for a while and thinking he was the genuine article might give her more confidence in him he wanted that he knew how to set a broken leg but he also knew how much the process hurt the woman sighed he hoped with relief a small crowd had gathered around her and moishe he looked up to the people and said fetch me a couple of flat boards and some rags to tie them to her leg nobody moved russie wondered what was wrong until rivka said gently dear they dont understand yiddish he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand feeling seventeen different kinds of idiot he tried again this time in the clear german hed learned in school every time he had to use it irony rose up to choke him here in the heart of germanys most important enemy the irony was doubled but no one in the crowd followed german any better than yiddish in desperation moishe tried polish here ill get what you need somebody said in the same language better yet he translated russies request into english several people hurried away in the rubble from years of bombings boards and rags were easy to come by moishe said to the fellow who spoke polish tell her im going to set her leg and splint it tell her it will hurt the man spoke in english the injured woman nodded maybe you and a couple of other men should hold her while i work moishe went on if she thrashes around shes liable to make things worse the woman tried to thrash moishe didnt blame her he admired the way she did her best to keep gasps from turning into shrieks he got the broken bones aligned and tied the splint tight to keep them from shifting again when he was through the woman whispered thank you doctor he understood that it warmed him when he stood up his own knees clicked the sky was growing light he sighed no point in going to bed he had an early broadcast scheduled at the bbc overseas services yawning he said to rivka i may as well just get my script and go on in oh dear she said sympathetically but nodded he and his family went upstairs together he found the manila folder with the papers inside then realized he was wearing only a greatcoat over pyjamas he threw on a white shirt and a pair of trousers and headed out to face the world a stretcher party had taken away the woman with the broken leg moishe hoped shed do well he wouldnt sleep but he thought his wife and son might the building that housed the bbc overseas services was at oxford street not far west of his soho flat and a few blocks east of hyde park as he walked to work london came to life around him pigeons cooed and sparrows chirpedlucky creatures they knew nothing of war save that it made the air sharp with smoke bicycles men and women afoot and horsedrawn wagons and even buggies taken out of sheds where theyd moldered for a generation clogged the streets petrol was in as desperately short supply here as in warsaw or lodz only fire engines had all they needed nathan jacobi approached the building that housed the studios from the other direction at the same time as moishe reached it the two men waved to each other moishe broadcast in yiddish and german jacobi translated his words into english his yiddish was polished and elegant if his english came close to itrussie wasnt qualified to judge but doubted the bbc would have hired him if it didnthe made a very effective newsreader indeed now he surveyed moishe with a sympathetic eye bad for you last night you look done in iam done in russie said i hope the tea in there has a jolt to it this morning if it doesnt im apt to fall asleep in front of the microphone itll be hot anyhow jacobi said which was true as for the jolt you never can tell from day to day not with these messes of leaves and roots and rose hips we get instead of the proper stuff he sighed what i wouldnt give for a cup of vintage darjeelingbloody war the last two words were in english moishe knew what they meant but took the adjective literally bloody war is right and the worst of it is we cant make the lizards out to be as black as we would otherwise because they havent done much worse to us than we were already doing to ourselves you would know best about that anyone who was in poland jacobi shook his head but still if we hadnt been geared up to a fever pitch to fight each other could we have put up such a battle against the lizards i suppose not but its no credit to us that we were russie answered its not as if we knew they were coming wed have gone right on slaughtering ourselves if they hadnt come too still i admit thats neither here nor there at the moment they are here and we have to make life miserable for them he waved the pages of his script then fished out his pass and showed it to the guard at the door the guard nodded russie and jacobi went in to get ready to broadcast forgive me exalted fleetlord but i have an emergency call for you from theth emperor yower atvars adjutant said in the vision screen the younger male looked as worried as he sounded very well pshing patch it through atvar said setting aside for a moment the war against the big uglies for his private conflict with the shiplord straha after straha failed to topple him from command of the conquest fleet the shiplord should have known revenge was on its way atvar wondered what sort of lying nonsense straha would come up with to justify himself pshings face disappeared from the vision screen it was not however replaced by that of straha instead atvars chief security officer a male named diffal turned his eye turrets toward the fleetlord diffal was earnest and capable all the same atvar yearned for the cunning deviousness drefsab had brought to the job even as a ginger taster hed been the best in the fleet but now he was dead and atvar had to make do do you have the shiplord straha in your custody he demanded exalted fleetlord i do not diffal also sounded worried i am informed that shortly before the arrival of my team aboard theth emperor yower the shiplord straha left this vessel and traveled down from orbit to confer with horrep shiplord of theth emperor jevon whose ship has landed in the central region of the northern portion of the lesser continental mass near the city called st louis atvar hissed horrep was a member of strahas faction pshing who must have been monitoring the conversation from his outer office came onto the screen for a moment exalted fleetlord theth emperor yower did not report this departure to us diffal said i have been in communication with theth emperor jevon straha is not aboard that ship nor has his shuttlecraft landed nearby i examined the radar records of the trajectory of the shuttlecraft computer analysis of the course they indicate gives a landing point relatively close to theth emperor jevon but not so close as would be expected if straha truly intended to confer with horrep the shiplord horrep i should inform you vehemently denies that straha sent messages announcing a visit as custom and courtesy would have required ever since we came to tosev custom and courtesy have been corroding atvar said diffal stared back at him not replying one couldnt expect a male in security to be concerned with philosophy as well atvar dragged himself back to the matter at hand well where is the shiplord straha then exalted fleetlord diffal said i dont know jens larssen was sick and tired of bicycles he was sick and tired of pedaling all over creation on missions he shouldnt have had to take on and knew he wouldnt get thanked for and of all the things he never would have expected before he set out from denver he was sick to death of pine trees first the arapaho goddamn national forest now the payette goddamn national forestor is it the nez perce goddamn national forest yet he asked as he worked his way up us toward lewiston idaho he was used to talking to himself on the road days often went by when he didnt talk to anybody else the longer he spent on his bike the better he liked being alone he wiped sweat off his forehead with a sleeve the day was hot but he wore long sleeves and a longbrimmed cap anywayhe was so fair that he worried more about burning in the sun than baking in his clothes his ears which the cap didnt protect were a permanently raw red peeling mess not that anybody gives a damn what i look like these days he said selfpity notwithstanding he wasnt a badlooking fellow a skinny blond viking just past thirty with bright blue eyes a sour twist to his mouth marred his features but since he couldnt see it he didnt know it was there a lizard jet screamed by high overhead flying west the lizards held the snake river valley from idaho falls to twin falls and used it as an air base against the pacific northwest outside of their airfields though they didnt seem to give a damn about the areaa sentiment with which jens heartily concurred hed gone through several townseven what passed for cities hereaboutswithout seeing a one of the little scaly bastards maybe i should have stopped and gone looking for them he said to the trees he knew enough to make the lizards have kittens what better way to pay back barbara for dumping him to pay back colonel hexham for helping him lose his wife to pay back oscar the guard for slugging him when he grabbed her to try to get her back to pay back the metallurgical laboratory and the whole stinking human race on general principles denver might not earn an atomic bomb all on its own but it would sure as hell get leveled a mountain stream chuckled by close to the road jens ran his sleeve over his forehead again then decided hed earned a break he pulled the bike over to the shoulder let down the kickstand and climbed off he pulled a tin cup out of the pack tied behind the bike saddle and headed for the stream he had to think about walking the first few steps his legs kept wanting to go round and round the water undoubtedly snowmelt was very sweet but so cold it gave him a savage headache for a few seconds after his first long swig he swore as he waited for the pain to subside a gray and blue jay scolded him from the branches of one of those pines oh shut up he told it youd say the same thing if it happened to you he unslung the springfield he carried on his back and looked around he wasnt much of a hunter but if a deer came down for a drink he wouldnt say no to trying for some venison the jay screeched again he swung the rifle its way then laughed at himself hed probably miss and even if he didnt nailing a jay with acaliber slug was about like smashing a roach by dropping an anvil on it you might have a few feathers left floating on the breeze but that was it since he was sitting by the stream he drank another cup of water if bambi didnt show up hed be gnawing on beef jerky for lunch hed traded a few rounds of rifle ammo for it just outside of a tiny town incongruously called cambridge the more he thought about the deal hed made the more he figured hed been snookered the water had its usual effect he got up and walked over to a treenot the one in which the jay still perched he undid his fly and setting his teeth took a leak against the tree trunk it didnt hurt as much as it had just after he came down with the clap for a while there hed been wishing his joint would drop off every time he used it but it still wasnt what anybody in his right mind would call fun goddamn bitch he ground out between his teeth as he fastened himself up again the first time hed got laid after barbara left and that was the present the stinking waitress had given him better he should have stayed a monk no sign of any deer no sign of any bears either but larssen at the moment was not inclined to look on the bright side of things cursing that slut of a waitress all over again and conveniently forgetting how much hed enjoyed having her while she lay in his arms he got up went back over to the bicycle and used his belt knife to carve off a lunchsized slab of jerky chewing on the stuff was about like gnawing wellsalted shoe leather good thing ive got a decent set of choppers jens said and the jay as if carrying on a badtempered conversation with him peevishly screeched back i told you once to shut up larssen reminded it it took no more notice of him than anybody else had lately he gulped down a mouthful of the jerky even after hed been chewing on it little sharp edges scraped his throat his laugh wasnt a friendly sound id like to see mr sam fucking yeager eat this stuff with his storebought teeth he said the more he thought about it the more he figured that if barbara could go for a guy like that she wasnt such a bargain after all but even figuring he was well rid of her didnt make the burn of being thrown over go away she shouldnt have decided he was dead not anywhere near so soon even if she had even if shed ended up in bed with that yeager son of a bitch a time or two she shouldnt have married him and she sure as hell shouldnt have let him knock her up that had put the kibosh on any hope shed come to her senses all right security larssen snarled making it into a curse word fouler than any of the others hed been throwing around if that stinking colonel hexham had just let him write to her as the met lab wagon train made its slow way across the northern great plains everything would have been fine but hed literally had to go on strike in denver to get hexham to let him send a letter by the time it got to her it was too late she was already married and already pregnant in peacetime some lawyer probably would have been able to buy himself a new packard from the fees hed have made trying to sort out the whole mess with the lizards giving the whole world hell nobody bothered with much in the way of legal niceties any more barbara decided she wanted to stay with mr dentures so she damn well did and im the one who gets screwedor rather who doesnt get screwed any more larssen said isnt that a hell of a note it was in more ways than one not only did his wife up and leave him but just because he was too burned up about it to let her go quietly hed been all but booted off the met lab team and so instead of the nuclear physics he loved and for which hed spent a lifetime training he got to play natty bumppo in the wilderness instead if he hadnt refused to admit he was beaten he never would have managed to make it back from white sulphur springs west virginia to chicago he never would have found out where the met lab crew had gone nor managed to beat them there on his own of course if he hadnt been quite so efficient there he might have had a better chance of hanging on to barbara well he owed the lizards a good deal for fouling up his life beyond all recognition so hed go on to hanford and see if it made a good place for building an atomic pile to blow them to hell and gone so much seemed only fair but after i do that ill get even with all the people who fouled me up too he said softly you just bet i will he got up from the streamside rock hed been sitting on walked over to the bicycle climbed aboard and started rolling north again ludmila gorbunova had seen more bomb craters from closer range than shed ever imagined before the war began but shed never seen never dreamt of a crater like the one over which her little u biplane skimmed now the burned area was most of a kilometer across maybe more than a kilometer the ground near the center had been baked into something that looked like glass and gave back dazzling reflections of the sun well beyond that trees housesessentially everythinghad been knocked flat it was as if god had decided to step on the land a few kilometers northeast of kaluga ludmila did not believe in god not in the top part of her mind she was a child of the revolution born in kiev in the midst of civil war but sometimes in moments of stress reactionary patterns of speech and thought emerged weve not yet built true socialism she reminded herself even with the german invasion the generation born after the war might have lived to see it now the air blowing in over the windscreen flung her words away having confessed her imperfection if only to herself she was willing to admit that stopping the lizards drive on moscow had taken something that looked very much like divine intervention shed been flying back from a harassment mission against the lizards when the bomb went off then shed thought at first that the lizards were visiting on the soviet union the same kind of destruction theyd meted out to berlin and washington only gradually had she realized her own country had matched the invaders at their murderous game thekukuruznik wheatcutterbuzzed over the hulks of three lizard tanks their guns slumped limply as if theyd been made not of steel but of wax and left too close to the fire measuring the revenge the soviet union had finally taken on its tormentors filled her with fierce joy she fired a burst from her machine guns at the dead tanks just to mark her own hatred the recoil made her aircraft shudder for a moment the u had been a trainer before the war but proved an excellent raider against the germans and then against the lizards it was quietthe germans had dubbed it the flying sewing machineand flew at treetop height and below speed wasnt everything im still alive she remarked again the slipstream blew her words away but not the truth in them the lizards hacked higherperformance red air force planes out of the sky as if they knew they were comingno notas if for intelligence was sure theydid know with help from electronics of the kind that the soviet union was just beginning to acquire the u though was small enoughmaybe slow enough tooto escape their notice ludmila patted the fabric skin of the planes fuselage shed been in theosoaviakhim the soviet pilot training organization before the war when she joined the red air force after getting out of kiev just before the germans took it shed wanted to fly bombers or real fighters getting assigned toa kukuruznik squadron had seemed a letdown shed flown in us to learn to handle other more deadly aircraft time changed her perspective as time has a way of doing she patted the us fabric skin again it kept flying kept fighting no matter what good old mule she said as she neared kaluga she grew alert once more the lizards still held the town though they hadnt tried to push north from it since the bomb went off she knew only too well that she hadnt been invulnerable till now just luckyand careful if you stopped being careful you wouldnt stay lucky far off in the distance she spotted a couple of lizard trucks stopped right out in the open by a haystack maybe one of them had broken down and the other paused to help any which way they made a tempting target her thumb slid to the firing button for the us machine guns a moment later she used stick and pedals to twist the little biplane away from the trucks in as tight a turn as she could manage that haystack didnt have quite the right shape to be sitting in a russian fieldbut it was just the right shape to serve asmaskirovka for one of the lizards antiaircraft tanks she headed back toward the airstrip from which shed taken off if anything dignifying the place with that description was flattery it was just a stretch of field with underground shelters for the pilots and groundcrew and with barleydraped camouflage nets to cover up the planes a few hundred meters away a false strip with dummy aircraft tents and occasional radio signals was much more prominent the lizards had bombed it several times sovietmaskirovka really worked as ludmila approached the airstrip a fellow who looked like any other peasant took off his hat and waved at her with it in his left hand she accepted the course correction and shifted slightly more to the north thekukuruznik bounced to a stop it was light enough to have no trouble on plowedup dirt and to stop very quickly once the wheels touched down like moles emerging from their burrows groundcrew men dashed toward the biplane and reached it before the prop had stopped spinning out out out they yelled not that ludmila wasnt already descending from the u no sooner had her boots touched ground than they manhandled the biplane toward what looked like just another piece of field but two of them had run ahead to pull aside the camouflage netting that covered a broad trench in went the aircraft back went the netting within two minutes of landing not a trace of thekukuruznik remained visible ludmila ducked under the netting too to help ready the biplane for its next mission shed made herself into a good mechanic red air force pilots needed to be good mechanics because very often the groundcrew werent that wasnt the case here one of the fellows at the base was as good a technician and repairman as shed ever known even so she helped him as much as she could it was after all her own neck zdrastyecomrade pilot the mechanic said in accented russian he was a tall lean gingerbearded fellow with a grin that said he refused to take her or anything else too seriously zdrastyeshe answered shortly georg schultz was a genius with a spanner in his hands but he was also a dedicated nazi a panzer gunner whod attached himself to the airbase staff when they were still operating out of the ukraine shed helped him get his place there shed known him and his commander heinrich jager before every so often she wondered how wise shed been how did it go he asked this time in german of which she had a smattering more than that now thanks to practice with jager and with schultz well enough she answered in the same language she turned away from him toward thekukuruznik so she wouldnt have to notice the way his eyes roamed up and down her body as if she were naked rather than covered by a heavy leather flight suit his hands had tried roaming up and down her body a couple of times too shed said no as emphatically as she knew how butnyet wasnt a russian word he seemed to have grasped for that matter he wasnt what youd call solid onnein either maybe her indifference was finally getting through to him though the next question he asked seemed strictly business did you fly over the crater from the big bomb you people set off a little while ago aber naturlichshe answered its a good direction from which to approach i can be sure no lizard guns will be waiting for me from that position and it lets me penetrate deep into their lines schultz puffed out his chest me and major jagercolonel jager nowwe were part of the raiding crew that got you russkis the metal i expect you used to build that bomb were you she wanted the words to come out cold as ice but they didnt quite one thing she reluctantly granted schultz was his habit of telling the truth as he saw it she found that sort of bluntness alarming in a way how had he managed to keep it without getting raked over the coals by thegestapo any russian so outspoken would have ended up in agulag if he wasnt simply executed as an enemy of the state but ludmila was willing to believe schultz wasnt lying just to impress her he preened some more yes we certainly were hadnt been for us germans you reds never would have been able to build your bomb at all ludmila felt like slapping his smug face i dont suppose you germansshe deliberately used the russian wordnemtsi with its overtones of barbarism and unintelligible babblingwould do anything like that if you didnt get your own share of the metal too as you say we built a bomb with ours where is the german bomb georg schultz went a dull red ludmila chuckled under her breath the nazis thought of themselves as the lords of creation and of their slavic neighbors as subhuman certainly incapable of a scientific feat like the explosivemetal bomb reminding them that wasnt so always gave a russian pleasure lets look over the aircraft schultz mumbled ludmila didnt argue with himthat was what they were supposed to be doing with tools in his hands schultz became useful enough for her to overlook if not to forgive his appalling politics his piggish approaches to her she already discounted plenty of russian men were just as unculturednikifor sholudenko for instance the nkvd man would be debriefing her as soon as she was done inspecting the u schultz grunted as he pried through the fivecylinder shvetsov radial engine ludmila had come to know that grunt whats wrong she asked one of the springs in your oil pump is starting to go he said here come see for yourself she inspected the part sure enough it wasnt as strong as it should have been she nodded with professional respect the german got into everything with monomaniacal thoroughness she couldnt imagine a russian technician stripping down a part that wasnt giving trouble do we have spares for it she asked i think so yes or if not i can steal one from a plane thats down for some other reason schultz said ludmila nodded cannibalizing machines for parts happened all the time good do that at once she said he gave her an odd look but i have not yet seen what else may need fixing he said what do you think i am some slapdash russian finding one thing wrong does not mean there will be no more after a moment he grunted again and pointed up into the greasy bowels of the engine here look ludmila who was close to twenty centimeters shorter had to stand on tiptoe to see what he was talking about as she did so he turned his head and planted a quick kiss on her cheek then he stepped back grinning as his advances went that one was downright gentlemanly she shook her head exhaling through her nose in exasperation you ought to know better than that by now why maybe ill get lucky one of these days he said altogether unabashed he grinned at her after all major jager did she hoped the light under the camouflage netting was too dim and gray for him to notice her flush but if shed seen him go red he could probably see her and she was sure she was red as fire now shed had a brief liaison with jager when shed flown foreign commissar molotov to berchtesgaden while jager happened to be there to get a medal from hitler for bringing explosive metal back to germany the major is a gentleman she said you she stopped in confusion in the classless society the soviet union was building you werent supposed to think or talk about gentlemen let alone prefer them maybe schultz said but im here and hes not ludmila made a wordless sound of fury she made it again when schultz laughed at her which only made him laugh harder what she wanted to do was stalk indignantly out of the underground shelter wriggling out from under the camouflage net was a poor substitute but it had to do a groundcrew man came hurrying over to smooth the netting and preserve themaskirovka he said comrade pilot they are ready to debrief you on your mission now thank you she said and hurried over to the underground bunkers that housed the air bases personnel more camouflage netting concealed the entrance she pushed it aside to go in there had always been the hope that colonel karpov the base commandant would take her report but no such luck behind a folding table in a chamber lit by four stinking candles sat nikifor sholudenko she sighed internally she and the nkvd man had come to the base together out of the ukraine so his presence here like schultzs was her own fault that didnt make him any easier to take sit comrade pilot he urged waving her to a battered armchair like hers his russian had a bit of a ukrainian flavor in it he handed her a glass here drink this it will make you feel better after your dangerous flight the glass held a reddish liquid weak tea she sipped cautiously nopepper vodka smoother than anything shed had in quite a while all the same she sipped cautiously drink drink sholudenko urged her his eyes glittered avidly in the candlelight it will relax you he wanted her relaxed all right she sighed again sometimes facing the lizards was easier than coming back and trying to deal with her own side a few kilometers south of pskov lizard artillery hammered at the line the russians and germans had built together to try to hold the aliens away from the northwestern russian city george bagnall watched the explosions from pskovskrom the old stone fortress that sat on the high ground where the velikaya and pskova rivers came together thekrom wasnt quite in range of the lizards gunshe hoped beside him ken embry sighed theyre catching it pretty hard out there i know bagnall answered there but for mistrust go we embry snorted though it wasnt really funny hed piloted the lancaster bomber on which bagnall had served as flight engineer when they brought an airborne radar to pskov to help the soviets in their struggle against the lizards the mission had been hurried and imperfectly conceived nobodyd bothered to tell the raf men for instance that pskov wasnt altogether in soviet hands the russians shared it uneasily with the germans each side hating the lizards just a littlesometimes a very littlemore than it did the other nikolai vasiliev and aleksandr german came into the makeshift office the one blackbearded and stocky the other redwhiskered and foxyfaced before the lizards came theyd commanded the first and second partisan brigades in what they called the forest republic harassing the nazis whod held pskov now they made up an uneasy triumvirate withgeneralleutnant kurt chill who had led a german infantry division and commanded all german forces in the pskov area gentlemen bagnall said in german and then amended that in russian tovarishchicomrades these are not the same thing aleksandr german said reprovingly russia had gentlemen the soviet union has comradeswe got rid of the gentlemen his smile showed yellow pointed teeth as if hed had some of those gentlemen for supper he was a jew he spoke yiddish not german and bagnall had to struggle to understand him but bagnalls russian picked up word by word since hed come to pskov was much worse the partisan leader translated what hed said for his companionda nikolai vasiliev boomed he drew his thumbnail across his throat under his beard as if to show what had happened to the gentlemen of old russia then he came out with one of the handful of german words he knewkaputt bagnall and embry both comfortably middle class by upbringing shared a look even in the middle of a war such wholehearted enthusiasm about the virtues of liquidation was hard to stomach cautiously bagnall said i hope this command arrangement is working to your satisfaction this time aleksandr german spoke to vasiliev before he replied vasilievs answer was voluble but unintelligible at least to bagnall aleksandr german said it works better than we had expected maybe because you englishmen seem more honest than we had expected when bagnall translated that for embry the pilot said general chill told us the same thing thats the idea old man bagnall told him and then turned the remark into german for the benefit of the partisan brigadiers the reds didnt want chill giving orders to their men and he would sooner have swallowed his monocle than let them command hisbut if pskov didnt have some sort of unified command it would damn well fall both sides then appealed orders they reckoned unsatisfactory to the raf men and both sides had agreed to abide by their decisions so far both sides had if you can keep the nazis and us equally dissatisfied you are doing well aleksandr german said bloody wonderful ken embry muttered without a moments hesitation bagnall translated that asochen khorosho very good here he was willing to sacrifice the spirit to preserve the letterand good feeling all around vasiliev and aleksandr german walked over to study the situation map tacked up on the wall the lizards were still about twenty miles south of town they hadnt tried a big push in a whilebusy elsewherebagnall supposedbut the work of building new defensive lines against them went on day and night not that pskov had much night during high summer bagnall waited for the russians to ask something complain about something demand something they didnt vasiliev pointed to one of the defensive positions under construction and grunted a mouthful of consonants at aleksandr german the other partisan brigadier grunted back then they both left the room maybe to go have a look at that position that was too easy embry said when they were gone cant have disasters every day bagnall said though he wondered why not as soon as the words were out of his mouth given his own experience disasters seemed almost as common as sparrows he went on can you tend the shop by yourself for half a moment id like to get outside for a bit and stretch my legs go ahead embry answered i owe you one or two there i think and this is a bloody gloomy room too right and not just because its poorly lit either bagnall said embry laughed but they both knew bagnall hadnt been joking when he escaped the massive medieval stone pile of the pskovkrom he let out a long sigh of relief now that summer truly was here pskov seemed a very pleasant place or could have seemed such if you ignored war damage everything smelled fresh and green and growing the weather was warm and pleasant the sun smiled down from a bright blue sky ornamented with puffy little white clouds linnets chirped ducks quacked the only trouble was you had to go through eight months of frozen hell to get to the four nice ones the lizards had bombed the sovietsky bridge older russians in pskov bagnall had noted sometimes still called it the trinity bridge over the pskova their accuracy was fantastically good as the flight engineer noted with professional jealousy theyd put one right in the middle of the span men could cross over the timbers laid across the gap but machines couldnt a german on a bicycle rode by and nodded to bagnallheil hitler the fellow said probably taking the englishman for one of his own bagnall contented himself with a nod having stalin for an ally had felt strange back in having stalin and hitler both for allies felt surreal as if the world had turned upside down well it bloody well has bagnall muttered boards clumped under his feet as he crossed the bridge into the zapsokvye district on the west side of the river behind a stone fence which looked old enough to have been there before the city itself stood the church of sts cosmas and damian on primostye its tall onion dome surmounted by an orthodox cross with a diagonal below the horizontal arm unlike a lot of the bigger buildings in the area the church hadnt been bombed it looked rundown anyway with paint peeling and pigeon droppings resembling snow on the green copper sheathing of the dome bagnall wondered if the communists had let anybody worship in there since the revolution a soldier in red army khaki was sitting on the fence that surrounded the church heno shewaved to bagnall zdrastyetatiana fyodorovna he said waving back tatiana fyodorovna pirogova swung down from the fence and strode toward him her blond curls gleamed in the bright sunshine she was prettyhell she was more than prettyin the broadfaced flatfeatured russian way and not even baggy red army tunic and trousers could altogether disguise her shape as she came up to bagnall she ran her tongue over her full lower lip as if she were contemplating what sort ofhors doeuvre hed make she probably was shed been after him ever since hed coordinated the defense that beat back the last lizard push against pskov up till then shed been with jerome jones the radarman bagnall and embry and alf whyte poor alfhed caught a bullet south of the city had flown into russia with an airborne set not poaching on his countrymans turf wasnt what made bagnall shy about taking advantage of tatianas abundant charms the moisinnagant rifle with telescopic sight she wore slung over her right shoulder had a lot more to do with it she was a sniper by trade and a damn good one bagnall wasnt in the least ashamed to admit she scared the whey out of him he pointed to the church and saidschon tatiana understood a little german though she didnt speak it that luscious lip curled she let loose with a spate of russian he had no hope of following in detail she repeated herself often enough though that after a while he got the gist the church and everything it stood for were primitive uncultured an insult to conjure with in russian superstitious rubbish and too bad neither the nazis nor theyashcheritsi lizardshad managed to blow it to kingdom come then she pointed to the church herself mimed opening the door and asked him a question so bluntly coarse that the bad language hed picked up from red army officers and men let him understand it perfectly did he want to go in there for a quick poke he coughed and choked and felt himself turn red not even english tarts were so bold and tatiana maneater though she might have been was no tart he wished to god shed been content with jones instead of setting her sights on him stuttering a little he saidnyet spasebo aber nyet nothanks but no he knew he was mixing his languages but he was too rattled to care bourgeois tatiana said scornfully she turned on her heel and strode off rolling her hips to show him what he was missing he was perfectly willing to believe thered be never a dull moment in the kip with her all the same hed sooner have bedded down with a lioness a lioness couldnt put one between your eyes at fifteen hundred yards he hurried back over the sovietsky bridge toward thekrom after an encounter with tatiana trying to figure out what the lizards would do next struck him as a walk in the park mutt daniels hunkered down in the swift and company meatprocessing plant behind an overturned machine whose gleaming blades suggested a purpose hed sooner not have thought about was that something moving toward him in the gloom in case it was he fired a burst at it from his tommy gun if it had been moving before it didnt afterwards which was what hed had in mind meatprocessing plant my ass he muttered this heres a slaughterhouse nothin else but his thick mississippi drawl didnt sound too out of place not when summer heat and humidity turned chicagos south side southern indeed he wished he had a gas mask like the one hed worn in france in the heat and humidity were also bringing out the stink of the slaughterhouse and the adjacent union stockyards even though no animals had gone through the yards or the plant in the past few months that smell would hang around near enough forever as to make no difference the huge bulks of the swift meat factory the armour plant beside it on racine avenue and the wilson packing plant not far away formed the keystone to the american position in the south side of chicago the lizards had bombed them from the air and shelled them to a faretheewell but gis still clung to the ruins the ruins were too ruinous for tanks too if the lizards wanted the americans out theyd have to get them out the hard way lieutenant daniels that was hank york the radioman who habitually talked in an excited squeak whats up hank mutt asked without taking his eyes off the place where he thought hed seen movement he wasnt used to being called lieutenant hed joined up as soon as the lizards invaded and went in with two stripes because he was a first world war vet hed added the third one pretty damn quick but hed only gotten a platoon when the company commander captain maczek went down with a bad wound he didnt much blame the army for being slow to promote him when the lizards came hed been managing the decatur commodores but in normal times whod want a platoon leader nearer sixty than fifty hell hed been a backup catcher for the cardinals before most of the guys he led were born but times werent normal no way hed stayed alive in spite of everything the lizards had thrown at him and so he was a lieutenant hank york said sir word from hq is that the lizards have asked to send somebody forward under a white flag to set up a truce to get the wounded out hell be coming from that directionyork pointed past a ruined conveyor beltin about ten minutes they say you can agree to up to three hours hold fire mutt yelled loud as he would have shouted for a runner to slide going into third spread the wordhold fire we may get ourselves a truce gunfire slowly died away in the relative quiet bela szabo one of the fellows in the platoon who toted a browning automatic rifle let out a yip of glee and said hot damn a chance to smoke a butt without worryin about whether those scaly bastards can spot the coal you got that one right dracula daniels answered the bar man szabos nickname was used as universally as his own nobody ever called him pete the handle hed been born with the cigarettes were also courtesy of dracula the most inspired scrounger mutt had ever known the limit of vision in the ruined packing plant was about fifty feet past that girders walls and rubble obscured sight as effectively as leaves branches and vines in a jungle daniels jumped when a white rag on a stick poked out of a bulletpocked doorway he swore at himself realizing he should have made a flag of truce too he jammed a hand in a pants pocket pulled out a handkerchief he hadnt been sure he still owned and waved it over his head it wasnt very white but it would have to do when nobody shot at him he cautiously stood up just as cautiously a lizard came out of the doorway they walked toward each other both of them picking their way around and over chunks of concrete pieces of pipe and in mutts case an overturned halfburned file cabinet the lizards eyes swiveled this way and that watching not only the floor but also for any sign of danger that looked weird but mutt wished he could pull the same stunt he saluted and said lieutenant daniels us army i hear tell you want a truce he hoped the lizards were smart enough to send out somebody who spoke english because he sure as hell didnt know their lingosam yeager might understand it by now if hes still alive mutt thought he hadnt seen yeager since his exoutfielder took some lizard prisoners into chicago a year before however strange the lizards were they werent stupid the one in front of mutt drew himself up to his full diminutive height and said i am wuppahhe pronounced eachp separatelysmallgroup commander of the race his english was strange to the ear but mutt had no trouble following it it is as you say we would like to arrange to be able to gather up our wounded in this building without your males shooting at us we will let you do the same and not shoot at your males no spying out the other sides positions now daniels said and no moving up your troops to new ones under cover of the truce hed never arranged a truce before but hed gathered up wounded in france under terms like those it is agreed wuppah said at once your males also will not take new positions while we are not shooting at each other mutt started to answer that that went without saying but shut his mouth with a snap nothing went without saying when the fellow on the other side had claws and scales and eyes like a chameleons just for a moment mutt wondered how funny he looked to wuppah if the lizards wanted everything spelled out that was probably a good idea we agree daniels said i am to propose that this time of not shooting will last for one tenth of a day of tosev wuppah said im authorized to agree to anything up to three hours daniels answered they looked at each other in some confusion how many of these hours have you in your day wuppah asked twentysix twentyfour mutt answered everybody knew thateverybody human anyhow which left wuppah out the lizard made hissing and popping noises this three hours is an eighth part of the day he said it is acceptable to us that this be so my superiors have given me so much discretion for an eighth part of a day we and you will do no shooting in this big and ruined building but will recover our hurt males and take them back inside our lines by the emperor i swear the race will keep these terms he looked down at the ground with both eyes when he said that truces with theboches hadnt required anybody to do any swearing but the germans and americans had had a lot more in common than the lizards and americans did well keep em too so help me god he said formally it is agreed then wuppah said he drew himself up straight again though the rounded crown of his head didnt even come up to mutts adams apple i have dealt with you as i would with a male of the race that sounded as if it was meant to be a compliment mutt decided to take it as one ive treated you like a human being too wuppah he said and impulsively stuck out his right hand wuppah took it his grip was warm almost hot and though his hand was small and bony surprisingly strong as they broke the clasp the lizard asked you have been injured in your hand mutt looked down at the member in question hed forgotten how battered and gnarled it was a catchers meat hand took a lot of abuse from foul tips and other mischances of the game how many split fingers dislocated fingers broken fingers had he had more than he could remember wuppah was still waiting for an answer daniels said a long time ago before you folks got here ah the lizard said i go to tell my superiors the truce is made okay mutt turned and shouted threehour ceasefire no shootin tillhe glanced at his watchquarter of five warily men and lizards emerged from cover and went through the ruins sometimes guided by the cries of their wounded sometimes just searching through wreckage to see if soldiers lay unconscious behind or beneath it searchers from both sides still carried their weapons one gunshot would have turned the swift plant back into a slaughterhouse but the shot did not come the terms of the truce forbade either side from moving troops forward mutt had every intention of abiding by that if you broke the terms of an agreement youd haveand youd deserve to havea devil of a time getting another one all the same he carefully noted the hiding places from which the lizards came if wuppah wasnt doing the same with the americans he was dumber than mutt figured here and there lizards and americans who came across one another in their searches cautiously fraternized some officers would have stopped it mutt had grown up listening to his grandfathers stories of swapping tobacco for coffee during the war between the states he kept an eye on things but didnt speak up he was anything but surprised to see dracula szabo headtohead with a couple of lizards dracula was grinning as he came back to the american lines what you got mutt asked dont quite know lieutenant szabo answered but the brass is always after us to bring in lizard gadgets and the scaly boys they traded me some he showed them to mutt who didnt know what they were good for either but maybe some of the boys with the thick glasses would or could find out what did you give for em draculas smile was somewhere between mysterious and predatory ginger snaps a blast of chatter greeted david goldfarb when he walked into a friend in need the air in the pub was thick with smoke the only trouble was it all came from the fireplace not from cigarettes and pipes goldfarb couldnt remember the last time hed had a smoke he worked his way toward the bar a friend in need was full of dark blue raf uniforms most of them with officers braid on the cuffs of their jacket sleeves just a radarman himself goldfarb had to be circumspect in his quest for bitter if it hadnt been for the raf uniforms a friend in need couldnt have stayed in business bruntingthorpe was a tiny village a few miles south of leicester a greengrocers shop a chemists a few houses the pub and damn little else but the raf experimental station just outside the place brought hundreds of thirsty men almost to the door of a friend in need the place not only survived it flourished goldfarb somebody bawled in a loud beery voice the radarmans head whipped around there at a table waving enthusiastically sat flight officer basil roundbush who along with goldfarb was part of group captain fred hipples team that labored to incorporate lizard knowledge into british jet engines and radars goldfarb often thought that was the equivalent of trying to incorporate the technology of smokeless powder into the duke of wellingtons infantry squares but carried on regardless roundbush by some miracle had an empty chair next to him goldfarb made for it with mixed feelings on the one hand sitting down would be nice on the other if he sat next to the flight lieutenant not a barmaid in the world let alone the ones in bruntingthorpe would look at him besides being an officer roundbush was tall and blond and ruddy and handsome with a soupstrainer mustache a winning attitude and a chestful of medals goldfarb had a military medal himself but it didnt match up nor did he other rank mediumsized lean with the features and dark curly hair of an eastern european jew sitting down next to roundbush reminded him of how unenglish he looked his parents had got out of poland a little before the first world war a lot of people hadnt been so lucky he knew that very well stella darling roundbush called waving because it was he the barmaid came right away with a broad smile on her face pint of best bitter for my friend here and another for me as well right yare dearie stella said and swayed away roundbush stared after her by god id like to take a bite out of that arse he declared his upperclass accent made the sentiment sound a trifle odd but no less sincere for that as a matter of fact so would i goldfarb said he sighed he didnt have very much chance of that not just with roundbush next to him but with the pubwith the whole experimental stationfull of officers stella came back with the tall glasses of beer roundbush banged his teeth together if goldfarb had done that hed have got his face slapped for the mustachioed fighter pilot stella giggledwhere is justice goldfarb wondered a thought that would have been more talmudic had it been directed to something other than trying to end up in bed with a barmaid basil roundbush raised his glass on high goldfarb dutifully followed suit instead of proposing a toast to stellas hindquarters as the radarman had expected roundbush said to the meteor and drank to the meteor goldfarb drank too when you got right down to it a jet fighter was more toastworthy than a barmaids backside and less likely to cause fights too on account of the meteor were going to be good chaps and pedal on back to barracks at closing time roundbush said were going up tomorrow afternoon and the powers that be take a dim view of improving ones outlook even with such camel piss as this allegedly best bitter within twelve hours of a flight the thin sour beer did leave a good deal to be desired even by wartime standards goldfarb was about to agree to that with the usual profane embellishments when he really heard what the flight officer had said weregoing up he said theyve installed a radar in a meteor at last then that they have roundbush said it will give us rather better odds against the lizards wouldnt you say he spoke lightly hed flown a spitfire in the battle of britain when a fighter pilots life expectancy was commonly measured in days but a spitfire had had an even chance against a messerschmitt bf against lizard aircraft you had to be lucky just to come back from a combat mission actually shooting the enemy down was about as likely as winning the irish sweepstakes dyou think well actually be able to accomplish something against them now goldfarb asked we add the radar which is your wicket and we add a good deal of speed which is always an asset roundbush said put them together and id say they improve our chances all the way up to bloody poor as a joke that wouldnt have been bad the trouble was roundbush wasnt joking goldfarb had tracked lizard aircraft on groundbased radar down at dover before the aliens openly revealed their presence theyd gone so high and fast he and everybody else had wondered if they were real or defects in the mechanism he and everybody else knew the answer to that now roundbush said youve flown airborne radar before havent you yes of course you have thats why group captain hipple wanted you as part of the group dont mind me im a silly ass tonight thats right goldfarb hoped the pilot would realize he was agreeing about his experience not the later parenthetical comment hed been in charge of a set flown in a lancaster to see if the thing could be done rather more room to fit the set in a bomber fuselage than in the meteor rather roundbush said and drained his glass goldfarb finished his bitter too then held up a hand to buy a round in turn that was inviolable pub custom two men together two rounds four men together four rounds eight men together and theyd all go home half blind stella took her time about noticing a mere radarman but goldfarbs halfacrown spent as well as anyone elses when she went off to get change though she didnt put as much into her walk for him as she had for roundbush the pilot said wed be better off still if we had guided rockets like the lizards then wed knock their planes out of the sky at twenty miles as they can with us once were inside gun range we have an almost decent chance but getting there as the saying goes is half the fun yes i know about that goldfarb said the lizards had fired radarhoming rockets at his lanc turning off the radar made them miss but a turnedoff radar was of even less use than no radar at all because it added weight and made the aircraft that carried it slower and less maneuverable good one less thing to have to brief you about roundbush poured down his pint apparently in one long swallow then waved to get stellas attention well just have ourselves another one before we toddle on back to base another one turned into another two goldfarb insisted on buying a matching round part of that was pub custom another part was a conscious effort on his part to give the lie to jews reputation for stinginess his parents products of a harsher world than england had drilled into him that he should never let himself become a spectacle for the gentiles pedaling back to the airbase with four pints of best bitter in him gave a whole new meaning to roundbushs mockaristocratic toddling he was glad he wasnt trying to drive a car he expected to have a thick head come morning but nothing that would keep him from doing his work and certainly nothing that would keep him from flying the next afternoon the headache with which he did wake up wasnt what left him abstracted when he headed for the nissen hut hipples team shared with the meteorological staff he had his mind too focused on the flight ahead to be as efficient as he might have been in trying to decipher the secrets of a captured lizard radar though basil roundbush had had more than four pints the night beforehow many more goldfarb didnt knowbut seemed fresh as a daisy he was whistling a tune the radarman hadnt heard flight lieutenant maurice kennan looked up from a sheaf of threeview drawings and said thats as offkey as it is offcolor which is saying something thank you sir roundbush said cheerfully which made kennan return to his drawings in a hurry if roundbush hadnt been a flier he would have made a masterful psychological warfare officer goldfarbs pretense of its being a normal day broke down about ten oclock when leo horton a fellow radarman nudged him in the ribs and whispered you lucky sod after that he was only pretending to work an hour or so later roundbush walked over and tapped him on the shoulder what say we go don our shining armor and make sure our steed is ready to ride from another man the arthurian language would have sounded asinine he was not only a spirit blithe enough to carry it off without selfconsciousness hed fought a great many aerial jousts already goldfarb nodded and got up from his desk the flight suit of leather and fur was swelteringly hot in the bright sunshine of an english summers day but goldfarb zipped zippers and fastened catches without complaint three or four miles straight up and it wouldnt be summery any more for that matter the meteor surely had a higher ceiling than the trudging lanc in which hed flown before in the lancaster hed tended the radar in the cavernous space of the bomb bay in the new twoseater version of the meteor he sat behind the pilot in a stretched cockpit the radar set itself was mounted behind and below him in the fuselage only the controls and the screens were where he could get at them if something went wrong with the unit hed have to wait till he was back on the ground to fiddle with it groundcrew men pulled the plane out of its sandbagged camouflaged revetment and onto the runway goldfarb had heard jet engines a great number of times but being in an aircraft whose engines were being started was a new experience and one he could have done without it reminded him of nothing so much as taking up residence inside a dentists drill bit noisy what roundbush bawled through the interphone the moment the meteor began to taxi goldfarb realized hed traded a brewery horse for a thoroughbred the engine noise grew even more appalling but the fighter sprang into the air and climbed as if it were shot from a boys catapult so goldfarb thought at any rate till basil roundbush said this mark is on the underpowered side but theyre working on new engines that should really pep up the performance overwhelming enough for me already thanks the radarman said whats our ceiling in this aircraft just over forty thousand feet roundbush replied well be there in less than half an hour and well be able to see quite a long ways i expect i expect youre right goldfarb said breathing rubbery air through his oxygen mask the lancaster in which hed flown before had taken almost twice as long to climb a little more than half as high and roundbush was complaining about this machines anemia in a way that struck goldfarb as absurd in another way given what the pilot would have to face it seemed only reasonable the meteor banked gently through puffs of fluffy white cloud goldfarb peered out through the perspex of the cockpit at the green patchwork quilt of the english countryside good show this isnt a few months ago roundbush remarked casually time was when the ackack crews would start shooting at the mere sound of a jet engine thinking it had to belong to the lizards some of our pioneers and meteors took shrapnel damage on that account though none of them was shot down urk goldfarb said perhaps luckily that hadnt occurred to him down in dover the antiaircraft crew had opened up at the roar of jets without a second thought hows the radar performing roundbush asked reminding him of why they were flying the mission he checked the cathoderay tubes strange to think he could see farther and in greater detail with them than with his eyes especially when from this airy eyrie he seemed to be the king of infinite space with the whole world set out below for his inspection everything seems to be performing as it should he said cautiously i have a couple of blips that by their height and speed are our own aircraft could you fly a southerly course to let me search for lizard machines changing course to oneeightzero roundbush said obliging as a victorian carriage driver acknowledging his toff of a masters request to convey him to boodles like a proper fighter pilot he peered ahead and in all directions as the meteor swung through its turn i dont see anything goldfarb didnt see anything either his screens remained serenely blank in a way that was disappointing in another way it was a relief if he could see the lizards they assuredly could also see himand roundbush had made no bones about their planes remaining far superior to the meteor then off in the electronic distance he thought he detected somethingand then an instant later the radar screens went crazy with noise as if the aurora borealis had decided to dance on them im getting interference goldfarb said urgently i spied what seemed to be a lizard plane right at the edge of where the set could reach and then everything turned to hashwhich means he likely detected me too which also means were apt to have a rocket or two pay us a visit in the not too distant future roundbush said i dont propose to wait around for them all things considered he threw the meteor into a dive that left goldfarbs stomach some miles behind and thousands of feet above the aircraft he gulped and did his best to keep his breakfast down vomiting while you were wearing oxygen gear was not a good idea roundbush didnt make it easy twisting the plane from side to side in evasive maneuvers violent enough to make the wings groan in protest goldfarb suspected he was stretching the meteors performance envelope and hoped it had enough stretch in it the radarman had shut down his set to keep any rockets from homing on its signal now he was just a passenger useless weight as roundbush shed altitude the ground rushed up as if thrown at him not knowing whether the lizards had fired and missed or contented themselves with simply scrambling his signal made the descent all the more harrowing the first thing he said when the nose wheel touched down at bruntingthorpe was thank you the next thing was we have a bit more work ahead of us havent we teerts was getting quite handy with the eating sticks the nipponese used he shoveled rice with bits of raw fish into his mouth hardly spilling a grain or a morsel the big uglies were feeding him better than they had when they first took him prisoner he shuddered they could hardly feed him worse hishashi discovered a thin reddish piece of pickled ginger he picked it up turned both eye turrets toward it not so long ago hed been a killercraft pilot a proud male of the conquest fleet of the race now thanks to bad luck he was a prisoner in an empire of big uglies convinced that no worthy warrior ever let himself be taken prisoner to help squeeze all they could out of him theyd addicted him to this perfidious tosevite herb with a convulsive jerk of his hand he popped the piece of ginger into his mouth he went rooting through the bowl with the eating sticks looking for others he found them and gobbled them up the nipponese cook had been unusually generous he wondered what that meant the nipponese were not given to generosity unless they expected to realize something from it then as the ginger took effect he stopped worrying about why the nipponese had given it to him that they had was enough he felt smart enough to outwit every big ugly interrogator and nuclear physicist strong enough to bend the bars of his tokyo prison cell and escape the life of torment that he led those were only feelings he knew it all too well the interrogators and physicists had drained him dry everything hed known about splitting atoms they now knew theyd known much of it already the russkis had already built a bomb how the nipponese gloated over that how they strained every fiber to get one of their own could teerts have torn out the bars of his cell he would have thinking he could wasnt enough to make it real hed tried the first few times ginger had made him feel like a machine in somber fact he was just a male of the race and steel bars defeated him usually when they fed him so much ginger an interrogation was in the offing the nipponese liked to question him when the herb made his tongue loose and lively he waited for major okamoto his interpreter interrogator and occasional tormentor to come down the hall but okamoto did not come from the top of the lift ginger gave him teerts slid into the trough of despair that followed just as he started to curl up in the farthest corner of his cell with the blanket drawn up over him both for warmth and to cut himself off from the unpleasant outside world heavy tosevite footsteps came echoing down the corridor the jailer unlocked his cell come along major okamoto said in teerts language by now teerts paid little attention to his accent it shall be done superior sir teerts said but okamoto had to shout at him before he would get up the silent guard who always accompanied the major gestured with his bayoneted rifle for teerts to precede him before they left the prison okamoto decked teerts in a conical straw hat like the ones some nipponese wore and also gave him trousers and tunic he looked ridiculous but that was not the point the point was to keep him from being spotted from the air or by the races reconnaissance satellites the beastdrawn wagon that waited outside did not head off toward the nuclear physics laboratory as it usually did instead it took an unfamiliar path through the narrow crowded streets of tokyo teerts asked where are we going superior sir to the train station and then on to kobe okamoto answered dr nishina does not think you can tell him any more of use in his plutonium bomb project so the naval aviators will resume their questioning of you i see teerts said dully now something more than the absence of ginger weighed down his spirits the scientists on the whole had been restrained when he didnt know something the military maleshe shuddered the train station was packed with nipponese some in gowns some in shirts and trousers many in the uniforms of army and navy using a separate service for the water struck teerts as absurd but tosev had oceans where home had small seas so perhaps there was some justification for the idea most of the train was even more crowded than the station as a whole but teerts major okamoto and the stolid guard had a car all to themselves with tea and food already laid on okamoto did not object to teerts feeding himself his rice had ginger in it which buoyed his spirits a jerk said the train was in motion puffs of smoky steam flew from the engine teerts reckoned the coalburner an unbelievably filthy machine but on such matters the big uglies did not solicit his opinion above the racket of the engine above the clicking of the cars it pulled over the rails came another sound one teerts knew intimately the high screaming wail of a turbofan engine major okamoto looked up in alarm air raid he shouted just as bombs and cannon fire began chewing up the train shells punched through the roof of the car as if it were made of tissue a bomb exploded right next to it teerts felt as if he were caught in the egg from which all earthquakes hatched glass sprayed around him the car derailed and overturned when the crashing and the spinning stopped he found himself sitting on what had been the roof im alive he exclaimed and then even more surprised im not hurt major okamoto and the silent stolid guard lay on the roof too both of them bleeding and unconscious teerts snatched up the guards rifle and scrambled out through a shattered window ahead the engine was a shattered wreck behind some of the other passenger cars were in flames the big uglies who had managed to escape from them were more interested in rescuing their trapped and endangered comrades than in a male of the race especially since he still wore tosevitestyle clothes and from a distance might have looked like one of them he knew the rifle would fire once if he squeezed the trigger he wasnt sure how to work the bolt but one shot was more than hed had since he fell into nipponese captivity if all else failed he could use it on himself he put more distance between himself and the train wreck as fast as he could he didnt know what hed do for food or ginger but he didnt much care as soon as he found a place that was out of sight of the railway cars he took off the hideous clothes the big uglies had given him and stretched his arms up to the planes and satellites he devoutly hoped were watching come and get me he cried oh please come and get me sam yeager had been staring out the window of the bright yellow dc ever since it took off from lowry field outside denver hed never been in an airplane before and found looking down at the ground from two miles in the air endlessly fascinating ullhass and ristin kept looking out the window too but anxiously every time turbulence shook the aircraft they hissed in alarm you are certain this machine is safe to fly ullhass demanded for the dozenth time hasnt crashed yet yeager answered which for some reason did not fully reassure the lizard pows he added the pilot wouldnt take it up if he didnt think he could bring it down again biggest thing we have to worry about is having one of your friends shoot us out of the sky and everythings supposed to be taken care of to make sure that doesnt happen ullhass jerked a clawed thumb at barbara yeager who had the single seat in front of sams on the right side of the aisle shed closed the curtain over her window and was snoring gently how can she sleep in this trap of death the lizard said indignantly well for one thing being in a family way tires you out so you want to sleep all the time yeager said and for another she doesnt think this is onea death trap i mean relax boys well be down on the ground pretty soon now he looked out the window again the endless flat expanse of the great plains had given way to rather rougher ground much of it covered with pine woods the airliners two engines changed their note as it descended and it bounced a little when the flaps came down whats that ristin and ullhass exclaimed together sam didnt answer the flaps had caught him by surprise too off to the north the arkansas river was a silvery ribbon of water here and there buildings poked out of the forest more rumblings and thumpings came from under the dc the lizards started having conniptions again the noise and the bumping were enough to wake barbara oh the landing gear is down she said stretching which told ullhass and ristin and incidentally her husband what was going on after one bounce landing was as smooth as takeoff had been as soon as the plane rolled to a stop in front of a building made of corrugated sheet metal a fellow in khaki brought a wheeled ladder up to the door behind the left wing everybody out he shouted he had a rifle on his back just in case ullhass and ristin proved friskier than they looked the only friskiness they showed was grumbling over how far apart the rungs were on a humanbuilt ladder the hot muggy air hit sam like a blow when he got down onto the tarmac he hadnt played in the southeast for a good many years hed forgotten how sticky and unpleasant it could be he stood at the base of the ladder to help barbara down in case she needed it she didnt but her eyes widened just the same thank goodness the babys not due till winter if i were going to have it in august in this weather i think id sooner die come on lets get you folks under cover too the guard said pointing to the door in the airport building through which the lizards had already gone as they moved away from the ladder a couple of colored men in overalls climbed up into the dc to get out their luggage it was even hotter inside the building than it had been on the runway yeager felt as if he were stuck inside an upsidedown frying pan ullhass and ristin strutted around obviously enjoying the heat if it didnt seem like too much work id strangle them sam said barbara nodded even the tiny motion made sweat leap out on her forehead a twohorse team pulling a covered wagon a lot like the one in which theyd traveled from chicago to denver left from the other side of the building a moment later so did another one and a moment after that another one still what are those all about barbara asked pointing come onyou people and the pows go in the next one the guard answered we send em out in all different directions to keep the lizards from swooping down and tryin a rescue while we move the prisoners to their camp where is this camp anyway yeager asked hot springs maybe sixty miles west and a little south of here the fellow answered havent ever been there yeager said a gleam of mischief in her eye barbara said what with your baseball and all i thought youd been everywhere sam yeager shook his head i played in el dorado in the cotton states league back maybe ten years ago the year after i broke my ankle the league went under partway through the season hot springs wasnt in it then though i hear it joined up after the league started up again a few years later the negroes had already stowed their suitcases in the back of the wagon and had made themselves invisible again yeager had forgotten what things were like in the south how many colored people there were and how they mostly got the short end of the stick he wondered if they wouldnt have been just as well pleased to see the lizards win the war the lizards would treat everybody white and black like niggers after flying more than nine hundred miles from denver to little rock in a little over five hours sam and barbara and the lizards took two days to go the sixty miles from little rock to hot springs all the same yeager didnt complain till they got there he was essentially on leave it was pretty country too pine woods more than halfway to hot springs after which black gum and sweet gum began to predominate in the bottomlands by the creeks everything smelled green and alive and growing arkansas didnt seem to have seen a lot of war when he asked the wagon driver about that the fellow said the lizards bombed the aluminum plants over there by bauxite pretty good when they first got here but those are going again now otherwise it aint been too bad just looking at the highway tells me that barbara said and sam nodded theyd passed only a few wrecked rusted cars dragged off to the side of us most of them had their hoods gaping open as if visiting an automotive dentistwhatever was useful in their engine compartments had been salvaged by the time the wagon got into hot springs sam envied ristin and ullhass their scaly hides mosquitoes had made him and barbara miserable but didnt seem to bother the lizards maybe we do not taste good to them ristin said i wish i didnt yeager answered darkly hot springs was a mediumsized town tucked in among the deep green slopes of the ouachita mountains us entered it from the northeast and swung south past what the driver called bathhouse row where in happier times people had come from all over the world to bathe in the springs that gave the town its name and its fame the wagon rolled past the greensward of arlington park the limestoneandbrick fordyce bathhouse the plastered quapaw bathhouse with its red tile roof and mosaic dome and the hot springs national park administrative building before turning left on reserve and stopping at the magnificent fivestory towers of the army and navy general hospital the wagon pulled past the onestory white stone front and up under an awning that led into one of the towers were here folks he announced he looked back over his shoulder at the lizard pows youll want to stay under the awning when you go inside it shall be done superior sir ristin answered though whether he actually wanted to obey remained an open question but lizard aerial intelligence was uncannily good so if you were smart you revealed as little as you could to the sky yeager wondered where the decoy wagons were unloading their feigned prisoners he left his bags in the wagon helped barbara down and hurried after his charges into the hospital building barbara followed him inside there ullhass and ristin were talking in a mixture of english and their own language with a brightlooking man some years younger than sam who wore captains bars sam waited for the officer to notice him then saluted and said sergeant samuel yeager reporting from denver as ordered sir with my wife barbara and the lizard prisoners ristin and ullhass the captain returned the salute pleased to meet you sergeant mrs yeager he had a new york accent im benjamin berkowitz he glanced down at some papers stuck in a clipboard general groves speaks highly of your abilities with the lizards yeager from what ive heard any praise from him is high praise how did you get so good with them were you a translator or something like that before the war no sir i was a baseball player sams face heated as he admitted all i knew about creatures from outer space before the war sir i got from reading science fiction berkowitz grinned it made him look like a kid you know what sergeant im just the same way you know what else that starts us out two jumps ahead of everybody else because our minds are flexible he looked down at the papers in the clipboard again weve got you and your wife and the pows assigned to rooms and upstairs why dont you get settled in tonightsuppers at about half an hour from nowand report with the lizards at tomorrow that sounds fine sir sam said uhour bags are still in the wagon sir somebody will carry them up for you berkowitz said your job is to ride herd on your friends here a room in a hospital wasnt going to be as nice as an apartment across the street from the university of denver but yeager was in no position to argue he hoped barbara wouldnt mind the change too much she wasnt in the army but it still jerked her around when he and his companions trudged up to the fourth floor the rooms proved bigger than hed expected the window to had iron bars fittedon the inside so they wouldnt show from the airwhich meant that one was intended for the lizards a negro in khaki brought up the luggage sam pulled a halfdollar out of his pocket the black man shook his head sergeant im in the army jus like you this heres my job i dont care if youre a congressman buddy you do that kind of work in this kind of weather you ought to get something special for it yeager tossed the man the halfdollar he picked it out of the air with an infielders smoothness sketched a salute and went down the hall whistling something dixieland drawn by the noise in the hallway a lizard came out of room to see what was going on he had the fanciest body paint sam had ever seen ristin and ullhass hadnt kept themselves painted for months which made the contrast all the more striking this males body gleamed with spirals and swirls of silver and gold and red ullhass and ristin turned and stared their eye turrets swiveling toward the fancily painted lizard as if drawn to him by magnets then they started spluttering honorifics yeager had never heard before supreme sir splendid shiplord how did you come here splendid sir barbara didnt follow the lizards language as well as sam but tone and gesture spoke volumes by themselves thats animportant lizard she said quietly no kidding yeager murmured back his two scaly buddies were reacting to the fellow with the bright paint job the way a couple of bobbysoxers would have reacted to frank sinatra he walked over to the lizard gave forth with his best interrogative cough and said may i ask your name and rank he didnt use any of the formal titles of respect ullhass and ristin had employed the lizard was after all a prisoner the male turned from his two fellow aliens to yeager you speak our language as well as any tosevite i have heard he said and added the emphatic cough sam grinned a wide foolish grin as if hed just knocked in the gamewinning run in the bottom of the ninth the lizard went on i am straha shiplord of theth emperor yower former shiplord i should sayno more thanks to the exalted incompetence of atvar the fleetlord yeager stared how the devil had the americans bagged a shiplord from what he knew a lot of them stayed up in outer space where nothing human could touch them let alone capture them ristin said this is our thirdhighest male superior sir in all the fleet above him are only the shiplord of the bannership and the exalted fleetlord himself most of that was in english so barbara caught it too it was her turn to gape whats he doing here she asked a split second ahead of her husband whatare you doing here shiplord sam asked in the lizards language he granted straha his title but not the flowery language that went with it the lizard didnt take offense he said when the russkis set off their plutonium bombyou know about this he waited for yeager to say he did then went on and when other parts of our campaign were botched and mishandled i alone had the courage to stand up and propose that we replace the inept exalted fleetlord my motion had large majority but not the three parts in four our law requires it was defeated oh lord yeager said softly the scene sounded like something out of south america or the balkans somehow he hadnt imagined the lizards with political squabbles of their own it made them seem much morehuman he switched back to their language what happened then i knew the exalted incompetent would have his revenge straha said nowhere in the conquest fleet would i be safe from his injustice and so with my pilot i brought my shuttle down and gave myself into the hands of you tosevites here god its almost like rudolf hess flying to england barbara said when sam translated that yeah it sure is he said and sticking to english went on i wonder if we have the spaceship he flew down in if we do i wonder if we can make one like it if we can do that if you can you will be a greater danger to the race ristin said in the same language sam wondered why he didnt translate that for straha maybe he wasnt happy with him for giving the usa that kind of chance letting that go yeager gave his attention back to straha shiplord now that you are here with us what will you do i have already begun the alien answered i have made one radio broadcast telling the males of the race that this war will be lost because of the stupidity of the males who lead themeither that or this planet will be wrecked in the fighting i tell them the best thing for them to do would be to give up to the males of the empires in whose lands they are situated do you yeager said with something like delight lizard pows had broadcast to their comrades before but they were the alien equivalent of dogfaces nobody to take seriously on account of who they were but straha was a big wheel if he was turning collaboratorthe world might become a very interesting place the recording of the broadcast was scratchy full of hisses and pops and bursts of static tosevite radio equipment left a great deal to be desired and the big uglies broadcasts were vulnerable to interference from their star and from atmospheric electrical phenomena nonetheless the message being sent was perfectly comprehensible and made atvar perfectly furious straha was saying because our campaign has been misadmimstered at the highest level we have no hope of the victory for which the emperor sent us forth we have been betrayed by the arrogance and overconfidence of the exalted fleetlord who consistently refuses to listen to advice from those who know better than he and if we cannot win this war what must we do getting rid of traitors would be a good first step kirel said savagely who could have imagined this atvar agreed to be captured in battle is one thing and no disgrace to flee to the enemy especially when the enemy is not of the race such has never been done in all our history not since the empire first covered all of home in his mind breaking a precedent a hundred thousand years old was a crime as appalling as betraying the race strahas ranting had gone on while atvar and kirel vented their fury the fleetlord ran the recording back and let it play once more we must make the best terms with the tosevites we can i am treated well here by the americans though i was a shiplord in the force that vainly tried to overcome them males of lower rank enjoy treatment equally good here as is true in many of the other empires on this world take yourselves out of danger you should never have been in atvar stabbed out a clawed forefinger and turned off the recording how many of our males will hear this poisonous nonsense he demanded kirel looked unhappy some of these broadcasts are on our entertainment frequencies no doubt the big uglies learned those from prisoners otherstranslationsuse the frequencies the tosevites more commonly employ and are no doubt intended to boost their morale exalted fleetlord my opinion is that both uses are extremely damaging to us i should say so atvar snarled the race is hierarchical by nature and training foolish males who hear the thirdhighest officer in the conquest fleet tell them all is lost are all too likely to believe him what can we do to suppress his treacherous twaddle kirel looked unhappier still exalted fleetlord of course we attack transmitters but that does only so much good the americans quickly rebuild and relocate them and straha i am certain is not present at the transmission sites our engineers say these broadcasts are made from recordings where is he then atvar demanded his shuttle landed not far from one of the sites to which the big uglies fly prisoners surely they must have a facility somewhere in this area no doubt they do but they have gone to great pains to keep us confused as to where it might be kirel said so far they have succeeded too besides they may well have shifted straha away from that region to prevent us from reacquiring him through a raid on the prisoner holding facility in short we do not know where he is and have no immediate hope of learning most unsatisfactory atvar said we can jam the frequencies where strahas babbling is directed at other big uglies but if we jam those on which he seeks to speak to our males we jam our own entertainment channels which is also unsatisfactory straha he let out a long hiss i was angry at him for trying to overthrow me but even then i never expectedthis nor i exalted fleetlord kirel said he must have greatly feared the might of your vengeance atvar wondered if that was polite oblique criticism should he have tried to come to terms with straha after the shiplord failed to oust him how could he without relinquishing some of the power the emperor had granted him in any case no point worrying about that now far too late did we at least succeed in destroying the shuttle straha used to escape he asked ibelieve so exalted fleetlord kirel answered cautiously the big uglies show an amazing capacity for deception though so i cannot be quite certain wed better have destroyed it atvar said the deutsche are already throwing their own missiles at us but those are just shortrange weapons with bad guidance small payloads and no chance of achieving orbital velocity much less velocity to escape this planet if the big uglies get proper rocket motors though and a couple of them with atomic weapons he and kirel stared at each other in horror kirel said if that happens exalted fleetlord the entire conquest fleet is at risk we may have to think about wrecking this world for the sake of our own survival this fleets survival yes but the colonization fleet will be thrown away if it arrives to discover a world unsuitable for colonization it will also be thrown away if it arrives to discover a world that is the base for spacetraveling big uglies with atomic weapons kirel replied atvar would have given him a hot answer if only he could have come up with one at last he said let us hope we did destroy the shuttle that will buy us the time we need to complete the conquest before the tosevites become spacefarers but when you bought time against the big uglies somehow you always ended up buying less than you thought you were paying for marching nieh hoting sometimes thought hed been born marching he would have bet a goodly sum that he would die marching if his death advanced the cause of the proletarian revolution he would have accepted it without a qualm although he had no more interest in immediately dying than any other healthy man of thirtyfive hed been on the long march with mao commanding a ragged division of the communist army as it fled chiang kaisheks counterrevolutionary forces that had been a march worthy of the name now he personally commanded only a squadron of men on the road northwest from shanghai to peking it looked like a demotion it wasnt responsibility for guerrilla resistance to the scaly devilsand when necessary to other foes of the revolution as wellthrough that whole stretch of territory rested in his hands he turned to his secondincommand hsia shoutao and said this is surely the most complicated piece of warfare the world has ever known hsia grunted he was a big burly man with a wide toughlooking face the archetype of a stupid brutal peasant he had a deep rasping voice too and had used it and his appearance to escape trouble any number of times he was however anything but stupid laughing a little he said why on earth would you say that just because we the little scaly devil imperialists the kuomintang and chiangs counterrevoluntionary clique and the remnants of the eastern devil imperialists from japan areall struggling over the same territory no not just because of that nieh paused a moment to fan himself with his straw hat peasant dressthe hat loosefitting black cotton shirt and trousers sandalswas as good as anything at withstanding the muggy heat of chinese summer if we faced merely a fourcornered struggle everything would be simple for you maybe hsia shoutao said sometimes he played the role of foolish boor so well that he even seemed to convince himself with it i mean what i say nieh hoting insisted this is not a war with corners this is a war in a spiders web with threads running from each force to all the others and sometimes sticking when they cross consider sometimes the men of the kuomintang cooperate with us against the scaly devils sometimes they betray us to them knowing when they will do the one and when the other is a matter of life and death of success or failure for the progressive forces weve sold them out a few times too hsia said with a reminiscent chuckle exactly so and they are as wary of us as we are of them but sometimes we do work with them as we do sometimes with the japanese and sometimes with even stranger allies nieh said that foreign devil the american you mean hsia asked yes he was useful ive never seen a man who could throw likewhat was his name bobby fiore nieh answered pronouncing the foreign sounds with care yes without him we probably would not have escaped after we assassinated that scaly devil back in shanghai pity he was killed he could have taught our men his skill he was a reactionary of course hsia said of course nieh hoting agreed also a lecher bobby fiore had made full use of the services of the shanghai brothel in which nieh bad based himself while preparing the assault on the scaly devil official like a lot of his communist comrades nieh looked on such looseness with disdain but he was a pragmatic man as you say though he was useful not only for his throwing but also because he understood the little devils language we would have had to liquidate him sooner or later hsia said he was ideologically most unsound of course nieh said again i think he may even have known that but he had a true hatred for the little scaly devils even if it was just personal and not ideological personal hatred for the little devils is too easy to come by to be much of a virtue hsia shoutao said there nieh could not disagree with him pick up a foot put it down pick it up put it down if you let your feet work and didnt think about it you covered more ground than you dreamt you could the long march had drilled that into nieh he looked back over his shoulder the men he led were strung out along ali a third of a mileof the dirt road that was all right the less they looked like part of an armed force the less likely the little devils were to give them trouble peasants labored in the fields and paddies to either side of the road they looked up warily from their labor as nieh and his followers went by they were wiser than the scaly devils they knew soldiers when they saw them a couple of men waved to nieh they knew what kind of soldiers he led too that pleased him if at need his men could become but a single minnow in the vast school of the peasantry they would be impossible for any enemy to root out one of the peasants called are you people going by the camp the little devils built up ahead you want to be careful if you are they dont like anyone snooping around there thank you for the warning friend well steer clear nieh ho ting said he waved to the peasant who nodded and went back to work nieh and hsia nodded too to each other as long as the people supported your efforts you could not be beaten as a matter of fact nieh wanted as close a look at the prison camp as he could get without making himself appear an obvious spy to the scaly devils the camps theyd set up to oppress the people had become fertile sources of intelligence against them from this one for instance had come word that the scaly devils had cameras that could somehow see heat the news had tactical implications no campfires at night when in close contact with the enemyexcept as diversionstravel through cool water whenever possible and more the camp set in the middle of the fields that might otherwise have raised a good crop of beans was as big as a fairsized city the stink of its night soil came sharp on the breeze a lot of shit there thats not going into the fields for fertilizer as it should hsia shoutao said he thought like a peasant too true nieh said his voice abstracted as casually as he could he peered across the fields toward the perimeter of the camp razor wire with sentry posts and little forts all around liberating it would be suicidally expensive however grand to contemplate down the road swiftly drawing nearer came a rising cloud of dust its speed meant motor vehicles were kicking it up and motor vehicles in these days meant little scaly devils nieh did not break his stride his submachine gun was hidden in the blanket roll he carried slung over one shoulder he could get at it in a hurry if he had to but hoped the occasion would not arise motor vehicles were usually armored against weapons like his hsia walked along as nonchalantly as he did they stepped off the road into the field beside it when the vehiclea troop carriersped past had they not moved nieh thought the driver would have run them down what were peasants to an imperialist aggressor especially one of alien race what we ought to have hsia said thoughtfully is more land mines the little devils would lose some of their arrogance if they had to worry about blowing up as they barreled down the road we have people manufacturing some of them nieh answered if we want to get them fast and in quantity though wed do best to dicker with the japanese they dont have many vehicles of their own left in this part of china so they shouldnt mind trading us some mines i wonder what wed have to give in exchange food probably theyre always hungry as if we arent but hsia nodded after a few seconds he nodded again for a different reason youre right comradethisis a complicated war heinrich jager felt like a soccer ball with the continent of europe his pitch since the war started in hed been to just about every corner of it poland france the soviet union france again back to germany croatia france one more time and now germany again he turned to kurt diebner who stood beside him on the walls of schloss hohentubingen professor i tell you again that i am not needed for this recovery operation i would be of far more use to thevaterland leading panzer troops against the lizards diebner shook his head it has to be you colonel the physicist said running a hand through his greasy dark brown hair we need someone with a military background to supervise those engaged in recovering the material from the failed pile down in hechingen and you also have the required security clearances we prefer you to anyone from theschutzstaffel and the ss itself has no objection to your employment so you see he beamed at jager through thick blackrimmed spectacles and spread his hands as if hed just proved some abstruse piece of math relating to quantum mechanics the explanation made sense to jager which did not mean he liked it he wondered how hed got a good character from the ss otto skorzenys doing most likely skorzeny no doubt thought he was doing him a favor jager supposed itwas a favor but having himmlers approval however useful it might be was also slightly chilling jager also noted the bloodless language diebner used the failed pile twenty kilometers south in hechingen had poisoned a good stretch of the local landscape and would have poisoned tubingen too had the wind been blowing out of the south rather than from the north and west after the accident soldiers talked the same way they spoke of maintaining fire discipline when they meant not shooting until the enemy was right on top of you a geiger counter sat on the wall between jager and diebner it rattled away a good deal more quickly than it would have had everything gone right in hechingen diebner insisted the level of radiation they were getting wasnt dangerous jager hoped he knew what he was talking about of course nobody had thought the pile would go berserk before it did either diebner glanced down at the geiger counter its good enough he said maybe he needed to reassure himself every so often too good enough for us yes jager said what about the poor devils whore getting that stuff out of there getting pulled away from the front line was one reason he hated the assignment here having to deal with the men who went into hechingen to recover uranium from the pile was another kurt diebner shrugged they are condemned by the state he said as if he were pilate washing his hands if this did not happen to them something else would nothing like thisjager started to say but the words did not cross his lips some of the men who went into the underground chamber with shovels and lead boxes wore pink triangles on their striped uniforms others wore sixpointed yellow stars in thereich anything was liable to happen to jews and homosexuals you have of course told them the sickness from which they are suffering is only temporary and that they will make a full recovery diebner said yes ive told themthe first group and then the ones who replaced them when they got too sick to work no one had argued with jager when he spoke what he knew to be a lie the thin weary men just stared back at him they didnt believe a word he said he didnt blame them diebner shifted uncomfortably like jager he was a fairly decent man in a nation whose regime did horrible things as a matter of course if you werent directly involved in them you could pretend they werent there even if you were directly involved pretending not to see was one way of preserving in your own mind your sense of personal decency very fewwehrmacht officers admitted to knowing what the ss had done to jews in poland and russia jager hadnt admitted it to himself until a russian jew rubbed his nose in it diebner said if we do not recover the nuclear material colonel jager we are all the more likely to lose the war against the lizards at which point all ethical arguments become irrelevant whatever we must do to get it back we have to have it jager turned his back and walked several paces along the parapet arguments from military necessity were hard to refute and losing the war against the lizards would be disastrous not just for germany but for mankind as a whole and yetjager took the physicist by the arm when you say these things professor you should know firsthand whereof you speak come along with me diebner was not a small man nor a weak one he hung back protesting this is not my concern it is why we had you brought here my business is with the nuclear pile itself though a couple of centimeters shorter than the nuclear physicist jager was wider through the shoulders and better trained at wrestling not only that his will burned hotter he frogmarched the reluctant diebner off the wall and down into the bowels of schloss hohentubingen the castles cellar was a different world from the light and fresh air of the wall it was dank and gloomy somewhere out of sight water dripped continuously a startled bat dropped from the roof and flew chittering between jager and diebner the physicist jumped back with a startled oath jager wasnt dragging him along any more but he followed nonetheless officers learned ways to get themselves obeyed in happier times the cellar had contained a monster wine cask that held liters of burgundy the cask was gone now probably chopped into firewood in its place were the miserable cots of the prisoners who got the uranium out of the pile at hechingen faugh diebner said a noise of disgust jager wrinkled his nose too the cellar stank not least because the only sanitary arrangements were some buckets off in a corner not everything went into the buckets either jager said one of the symptoms many of these people seem to have is diarrhea yes i knew of this in principle diebner said in a small voice that suggested he was much more used to dealing with abstract principles than this reeking reality ah jager clicked his heels in exquisite irony are you also awarein principle of courseof the other symptoms this work brings with it which ones do you mean the physicist asked the burns from actually handling the metal the loss of hair the bleeding gums and nausea i am familiar with these yes and also with the cancer that is likely to result some years from now as a result of this exposure i know these things colonel you know of them jager said coldly heresee what they do to real people who are not just abstracted principles a man with a pink triangle on the front of his striped shirt was spooning cabbage soup into the mouth of a jew who lay on a straw pallet too sick to get up when the jew retched and coughed up the soup the homosexual held his head so he would not foul himself too badly then got a rag and put it on the patch of vomit then he started trying to feed the jew again it doesnt have to be like this jager insisted maybe we do have to use condemned people as you call them for this work but we dont have to make their lot worse by treating them like beasts of burden diebner nodded to the several wooden platforms that had been built around the edges of the cellarincongruously they reminded jager of the lifeguards stands by a lakeshore or along a popular stretch of riverbank each held not a lifeguard in white tank top and colorful trunks but a uniformed helmeted guard who cradled a submachine gun quietly the physicist said without coercion this work would not be doneand itmust be done for that matter neither the guards nor we are entirely safe jager looked at him sharply how do you mean how do you think colonel diebner answered we tooand the guardsare exposed to these radioactive materials at lower levels than the prisoners yes but certainly exposed what the longterm consequences of this may be i cannot say with certainty but i doubt they will be good we have lined the roof of this cellar with lead to keep the lizards from detecting the radioactivity gathered here that we are close to hechingen will help account for a higher level than might otherwise be expected and gives us some added security isee jager said he rubbed his chin remembering the raid in which he along with russians and other germans had stolen explosive metal from the lizards and remembering riding across poland with the german share of the explosive metal stowed in leadlined saddle bags he wondered what hed done to himself in the service of thereich the classically trained part of him thought of prometheus whod stolen fire from the gods and brought it down to mankind zeus had chained prometheus to a rock with a vulture gnawing at his liver the gods werent much in the habit of manifesting themselves these days but jager wondered what might be gnawing at his own entrails despairingly teerts turned his eye turrets toward the heavens those heavens remained empty silent if they remained so much longer he would either starve or be recapturedor use the one shot he was sure he could fire from his nipponese rifle he counted himself lucky not to have been recaptured already so much of the train on which hed been riding had gone up in flames however savage and backwards they were though the big uglies were not stupid enough to take his demise for granted a search would be mounted teerts was gloomily certain of that a little stream tinkled by the stand of brush where he was holed up at night he could come out to drink hed caught a couple of crawling and scurrying things and eaten them raw but hunger gained on him regardless he did his best to remember how used to hunger hed got while the nipponese were mistreating him but it wasnt easy he hungered for ginger too all the way down to the depths of his spirit every once in a while when he saw no tosevites around he emerged from the shrubbery during daylight to show himself for aircraft or satellites that might be passing overhead if theyd spotted him theyd certainly given no sign of it now he lay curled up in a nest hed made of branches and twigs and dry leaves it was the sort of thing in which an animal might live not a male of the race the nipponese had done their best to make him into an animal and failed now he was doing it to himself a noise in the skyteerts head came up but only for a moment some of the flying creatures of tosev were noisy as they made their way through the air his hearing diaphragms stretched tight with hope hed mistaken their wingbeats for the thutter of a rescue helicopter again and again he couldnt fool himself any more but this sound swelled and swelled teerts jumped to his feet crying the emperors name from above in a voice like thunder came a call in his own language male of the race show yourself this is hostile airspace we cannot stay long the accent was pure and cleanthat of home teerts had been listening to the mushy barking way the nipponese mangled his speech for so long he needed a moment to recognize this was how it should be spoken he sprang from cover waved his arms frantically and did everything but turn backflips in the wild effort to make himself as visible as he could his swiveling eyes caught sight of the helicopterand one of the crewmales saw him too and the big ungainly ever so beautiful machine swung in his direction its rotor kicked up gravel and dust nictitating membranes slid across his eyes to protect them from flying grit the helicopter hovered its landing wheels not quite touching the ground its side door came open a male inside let down a chainlink ladder teerts was already running toward the copter he scrambled aboard weve got him the male shouted to the pilot and weapons officer in their cockpit forward the fellow hauled in the ladder slammed and dogged the door the helicopter was already gaining altitude and scurrying out toward the sea thank you teerts gasped the emperor grant you bounty you dont know dont thank me yet the crewmale answered he hurried to a machine gun that stuck out one of the windows were a long way from safe weve got a killercraft overhead but if the big uglies send enough aircraft after us theyre liable to catch up with us and shoot us down theyre a lot faster than we are he turned one eye back toward teerts who are you anyway teerts killercraft pilot and flight leader teerts answered stating his specialization and rank made him consciously aware for the first time in a very long while that he was without his body paint that didnt seem to bother his rescuer who said good you know how to handle one of these things then he patted the machine gun in case i get hit keep shooting till we go into the water it shall be done superior sir teerts said actually he outranked the male at the gun but he was not part of the helicopter crewand after so long in nipponese captivity he was used to attaching honorifics to anyone with whom he spoke as the land of nippon receded behind them his wits began to work again you couldnt have flown straight here from any land the race controls you must have used inflight refueling thats right the crewmale said were on our way out for more hydrogen now too that should be enough to take us back to base he paused listening to the microphone fastened to one hearing diaphragm pilot says our killercraft cover just shot down three of the big uglies aircraft and the rest have broken off pursuit now i really start to think were going to be all right emperor be praised teerts said dropping his eye turrets to the grimy mats on the floor of the helicopter when he raised them again he asked how is the conquest faring ive been away from our kind for what has to be more than a year between you me and this gun here not so well the crewmale answered we were driving the russkis hard and then they somehow exploded an atomic bomb and made us stop there these big uglies are a thousand times worse than we expected when we got to this stinking planet you dont know the half of it teerts said feelingly the nipponese told me aboutgloated aboutthe russkis atomic bomb i was afraid they were telling the truth but i wasnt sure he suddenly sat bolt upright on the hard uncomfortable seat theyre working on their own nuclear project too they spent endless time interrogating me about atomic energy they got everything out of me too thats how i managed to escape they were taking me somewhere else so they could ask me about different things well sendthat news upstairs by the emperor the crewmale exclaimed lowering his eyes as teerts had and after that unless i miss my guess well have a present for these big uglies you can show us where this work was being done the city was tokyo teerts answered where in the city likely wont matter the crewmale finished for him teerts shivered the male was probably right the nipponese would discover firsthand what nuclear weapons were like they were only big uglies and vicious ones to boot but did they deserve that whether they did or not he would have bet they were going to get it no point in arguing about that the decision would come from levels far higher in the hierarchy than himself or the crewmale he said do you have any food here the nipponese didnt give me a lot to eat the crewmale unsnapped a pouch on the side of the helicopter wall pulled out a couple of ration packs and tossed them to teerts they were unheated and inherently unexciting just fuel for the body to keep a male going until he had a chance to stop and rest and eat something better teerts thought hed never eaten anything so wonderful in his life after so long without the tastes of home this may be the best meal i ever had he said ecstatically his tongue cleansed the hard outer surfaces of his mouth every crumb it encountered brought him fresh delight ive heard others we rescued say the same thing the crewmale answered that may be true for them but i just cant see it he let his mouth fall open to show he didnt expect to be taken altogether seriously teerts laughed too he remembered the rude jokes he and the rest of his flight had made about ration packs in the days before hed been captured he also remembered something else remembered it with a physical longing more intense than anything hed ever known outside of mating season hesitantly he said the nipponese fed me a tosevite herb they made me depend on it my body craves it still i dont know what ill do without it to his surprise the crewmale laughed again he rummaged in a pouch he wore on one of his belts pulled out a tiny plastic vial and offered it to teerts who says you have to do without it friend here have a taste on me liu han grunted as the labor pain washed over her oh that is a good one ho ma the midwife said enthusiastically shed been saying that for a long time now she went on soon the baby will come and then you will be happy shed been saying that for a long time too which only proved she didnt know liu han very well several midwives had set up shop in the prison camp liu han recognized the redtasseled signs they set up outside their huts and knew what the characters on those signs said even if she could not read them light cart and speedy horse on one side and auspicious grandmotherinlaw on the other the midwife whod worked in her nowwrecked village had had just the same sign ttomalss said move aside please female ho ma so the camera can see as it should the midwife grumbled under her breath but moved aside the little scaly devils were paying her extravagantly in silver and food and even shed boasted to liu han in tobacco theyd got from who could say where they had to pay her extravagantly to ignore the bright lights theyd put into liu hans hut to ignore their presence and that of their cameras and to ignore the way that contrary to all custom and decency theyd insisted on liu hans being naked through the entire delivery so those cameras could do their work as the little scaly devils thought proper to the scaly devils payment liu han had added several dollars mex from her own pocket to persuade ho ma not to gossip about the humiliations she would witness the midwife had agreed at oncefor money a midwife would agree to almost anything whether she would keep her promise afterward was a different question another contraction shook liu han ho ma peered between her legs i can see the top of the babys head she said lots of nice black hair but then the father had proper black hair even if he was a foreign devil didnt he yes liu han said wearily bobby fiores being the babys father would just add to the scandal of this already extremely irregular delivery liu han feared she could never bribe ho ma enough to be sure of keeping her quiet then her body made its own demands and she stopped worrying about what ho ma would say the urge to push the baby out of her became overwhelming she held her breath and bore down with all her might a squealing grunt told of her effort again ho ma exclaimed when liu han had to stop because like a punctured pigs bladder she had no more air left in her liu han needed no urging she panted for a moment gathering her strength took a deep breath and held it and pushed once more the urgency seemed unbearable as if she were passing night soil at last after months of complete constipation once more ho ma said reaching down to help guide the baby out a couple of the little scaly devils with their accursed cameras shifted so they could still see what they wanted to see caught up in her bodys travail liu han barely noticed them here i have the head the midwife said a pretty baby considering who its father wasnot bignosed at all one more push now and ill bring the baby out of you liu han pushed now that the head had emerged the rest was easy a moment later ho ma said a girl baby liu han knew she should have been disappointed but she was too worn to care a couple of more pushes brought out the afterbirth looking like a great bloody chunk of raw liver one of the little scaly devils set down his camera and ran out of the hut slamming the door behind him ho ma tied off the umbilical cord with two pieces of silk thread then she cut the cord with a pair of shears she pinched the babys feet after a moment it began to squall like an angry kitten the midwife thrust an iron poker into the flames of the fireplace then touched the hot tip of it to the end of the umbilical stump do you do that to kill the little invisible demonsnot the word i want but as close as your language hasthat cause sickness ttomalss asked i do that because it is custom to do that ho ma answered rolling her eyes at the foolish questions the scaly devils asked she wrapped the afterbirth in a cloth to take it away and bury it in some outoftheway place liu han had long since resigned herself to the little devils ignorant and presumptuous questions give me the baby please she said just talking was an enormous effort she remembered that crushing weariness from the son shed borne to her husband not long before a japanese attack killed him and the boy ho ma handed her the child as shed said a girl her private parts swollen as newborns often were liu han set the baby to her breast the tiny mouth rooted found the nipple and began to suck liu han turned to ttomalss and said have you seen everything you need may i put my clothes on again she wanted to put some rags between her legs she knew she would pass blood and other discharge there for weeks to come the little scaly devil did not answer not directly instead he asked another question why do you not clean off the hatchling which is still covered with these disgusting substances from inside your body liu han and ho ma exchanged glances how stupid scaly devils were the midwife answered the baby is still too new to the world to bathe on the third day after it is born it will be more solid we will wash it then ttomalss spoke to one of his machines in his own language the machine answered back liu han had seen that too often to be amazed by it any more the scaly devil switched to chinese and said my information is that other groups of big uglies do not do this who cares what foreign devils do ho ma said scornfully liu han nodded surely chinese ways were best cradling the baby in one arm she sat up ever so slowly and carefullyshe felt as if shed aged about fifty years this past halfdayand reached for her tunic and trousers when ttomalss did not object she set the baby down for a moment and got dressed then picked up the child again set it to her shoulder and patted it on the back till it belched out the air it had sucked in with her milk ho ma gave her some tea a single hardboiled egg had she had a son she would have got five round sugar cakes of fermented dough and little sponge cakes shaped like fans pomegranates and ingots of silver she devoured the traditional food for shed eaten nothing and drunk only a glass of hot sugar water with a dried shrimp in itshe hadnt eaten the shrimpsince her labor began she was stuffed when she was through but felt she could have eaten twice as much one of the little scaly devils holding a camera spoke to ttomalss in their language superior sir that was one of the most revolting processes i have ever had the misfortune to observe i thank you for maintaining your position ttomalss answered we may have lost valuable information when dvench fled this hut he failed in his duty to the race you are generous in your praise superior sir the other scaly devil said shall we now proceed with the experiment liu han had listened to their hisses and squeaks with half an ear not only was she exhausted from childbirth and distracted by her newborn daughter but she also had only a halting command of the scaly devils tongue but the word experiment made her start paying close attention though she tried not to show it shed been part of the little devils experiments ever since they first appeared they had their purposes which emphatically werenot hers ttomalss said no the matter is not yet urgent let the chinese carry on with their ceremonies these may conceivably produce an increased survival rate for infants more tosevites appear to be of this chinese variety than any other it shall be as you say superior sir the other little devil said my opinion is that its surprising the big uglies retain their numbers let alone increase them with this system of reproduction passing an egg is far simpler and less dangerous and harrowing to the female involved than this gorefilled procedure there we agree msseff ttomalss said that is why we must learn to understand how and why the tosevites do in fact increase perhaps the risks inherent in their reproductive processes help explain their yearround sexual activity this is another connection we are still exploring liu han stopped listening whatever their latest experiment was they werent going to tell her any more about it now ho ma took up the cloth with the afterbirth and carried it away even ttomalss and the other scaly devils got out of the hut leaving liu han alone with the baby she set the sleeping little girl in the scrapwood cradle shed readied as ho ma had said it did look like a proper chinese baby for which she was glad if she ever escaped the camp she could raise it properly too with no awkward questions to answer if she ever escaped the campher laugh rang bitter what chance of that with or without the baby then all thought no matter how bitter dissolved in an enormous yawn liu han lay down on top of thekang the raised heated platform in the middle of the hutand fell deeply asleep the baby woke her a few minutes later she had groggy memories of her first child doing that too the next two days passed in a blur of fatigue ho ma came back with food and the little scaly devils with their cameras then on the third day the midwife brought incense paper images of the gods and paper goods to sacrifice to them and a basin to be filled with water and a spicy mixture of ground locust branch and catnip leaves ho ma prayed to the family kitchen god the goddess of smallpox the goddess of playmates the goddess of breast milk the six minor household gods the god of heaven and the god of earth and the god and goddess of the bed and burned offerings to each she set out round cakes in a row before their images msseff said to ttomalss superior sir if all this is necessary for survival then i am an addled egg ttomalss mouth fell open the midwife bathed the baby dried her and sprinkled alum on her here and there then she laid the child on her back and set slices of ginger by the blackened stump of the umbilical cord she put a little smoldering ball of catnip leaves on the ginger and another at the babys head a couple of the scaly devils let out hisses of longing for the ginger ttomalss took no notice of those perhaps not recognizing what they signified other ritual objects made their appearance the small weight that portended a big future the padlock to ward off impropriety the tap of the onion punningly used to impart wisdom both were pronouncedtsung and the comb for the childs hair the onion would be tossed on the roof of the hut to predict the sex of liu hans next child by the way it landed ho ma extinguished the burning balls of catnip and lit the paper images of the gods who having done their duty were thus urged to depart the scene the hut filled with smoke coughing a little the midwife took her leave the onion thumped up onto the roof the root points to the eaves ho ma called your next baby will be a boy liu han couldnt remember what the onion had foretold after the birth of her first child she wondered how many fortunetellers made a good living by counting on their bad predictions being forgotten a lot of them she suspected but how could you tell which ones till after the fact as if ho mas leaving the hut had been a signal several little scaly devils came in they were not carrying cameras they were carrying guns alarm flared in liu han she snatched up the baby and held it tight ttomalss said that will do you no good we now go to the next step of the experimentwe of the race will raise this hatchling apart from you tosevites to learn how well it can acquire duty and obedience he turned to the males and spoke in his own language take the hatchling liu han screamed and fought with all she had in her it did no good individually the scaly devils were little but several of them together were much stronger than she the threat of their guns drove back the people who came out to see why she was screaming even the sight of a wailing infant in their arms was not enough to make men brave those terrible guns liu han lay on the ground in the hut and moaned then slowly she rose and made her painful way through the staring chattering people and into the marketplace eventually she came to the stall of the poultry seller the little scaly devils might think they were through with her but she was not through with them half past two in the morning vyacheslav molotov wished he were home and asleep in bed stalin however had not asked his opinion merely summoned him stalin was not in the habit of asking anyones opinion he expected to be obeyed if he kept late hours everyone else would too the doorman nodded politely to molotov who nodded back normally he would have ignored such a flunky but the doorman alongtime crony of stalins knew as many secrets as half the members of the politburoand he had his masters ear slighting him was dangerous stalin was writing at his desk when molotov came in molotov wondered if hed become dominant simply because he needed less sleep than most men no doubt that wasnt the whole answer but it must have played its part take some tea vyacheslav mikhailovich stalin said pointing to a samovar in a corner of the cramped room thank you iosef vissarionovich molotov answered when stalin told you to take tea you took tea even if it was the vile mix that passed for the genuine article these daysmuch worse than the coarsemakhorka everyone even stalin had to smoke molotov poured a glassful sugared itas long as the soviet union had beets it would have sugarand drank he had to work to keep from betraying surprise this isexcellent the real leaf stalin said smugly brought in from india thanks to the lull in the fighting with the lizards after we showed we could match them bomb for bombso there his eyes added hed gone against molotovs advice and not only got away with it but prospered not only was that bad in itself it meant he would pay less attention to molotov the next time the foreign commissar sipped his tea savoring its warmth and its rich flavor when he was through he set the glass down with real regret what do you need iosef vissarionovich he asked the lull is slowly dying away stalin answered the lizards begin to suspect we have no more bombs than that first one he sounded as if that were molotovs fault as i have noted comrade general secretary they are aware we used their metal to produce that bomb molotov said cautiously telling stalini told you so was as dangerous as defusing any other pyrotechnic device molotov tried to put the best face on it he could they cannot know however whether we have enough of that metal to use it for more bombs we should stalin said sharing with the germans was a mistake his mouth twisted in annoyance at the irrevocability of the pastnichevo try as he might stalin could not utterit cant be helped with the fatalism a native russian put in the word his throaty georgian accent gave it a flavor ofbut someone ought to be able to do something about it molotov said creating the impression that wedo have more bombs available will be a cornerstone of our policy against the lizards for some time to come they suspect our weakness now if they become certain of it the strategic situation reverts to what it was before we used the bomb and that was not altogether to our advantage he stood up and got himself another glass of tea both because he hadnt had any real tea in a long time and because he was all too aware of how large an understatement hed just loosed if the soviet union hadnt set off that bomb the lizards surely would have been in moscow by now if stalin and he had escaped the fall of the city theyd be trying to run the country from kuibyshev in the heart of the urals would the workers and peasantsmore to the point would the soldiersof the soviet union have continued to obey orders from a defeated government that had had to abandon the national capital maybe neither molotov nor stalin had been anxious to attempt the experiment stalin said kurchatov and his team must accelerate their efforts yes comrade general secretary molotov said dutifully igor kurchatov georgi flerov and the rest of the soviet nuclear physicists were doing everything they could to isolate uranium and to produce the equally explosive element unfortunately before the war nuclear physics in the soviet union had lagged several years behind its course in the capitalist and fascist nations the mere search for abstract knowledge had not seemed vitally urgent then now it did but with their limited expertise and limited cadre the physicists were still years away from producing homegrown nuclear material the fascists in germany are not idle stalin said in spite of their setback espionage confirms that their explosivemetal project goes forward i believe the same is true in the united states and britain though communications with them both are not everything we might wish he slammed a fist down on the top of the desk and the japanesewho knows what the japanese are doing i dont trust them i never trust them the only man stalin had ever trusted was hitler and that trust almost destroyed the soviet union but here molotov agreed with him he said if zhukov hadnt treated them roughly in mongolia in they would have joined with the nazis two years later and that might have been very difficult for us it would have been altogether disastrous but molotov didnt have the nerve to tell that to stalin no one had the nerve to tell stalin such things the moskva hotel had two wings that spectacularly didnt match the architects had chosen to show stalin their plans expecting him to pick one design or the other hed just nodded and said yes do it that way and no one dared do anything else the doorman tapped on the door stalin and molotov looked at each other in surprise they werent supposed to be interrupted then the doorman did something even more surprising he stuck his head in and said iosef vissarionovich the officer here bears an urgent message may he deliver it after a moment stalin saidda with clear overtones ofit had better be the officer wore the three red squares of a senior lieutenant and the green backing on his collar tabs that meant he was from the nkvd saluting he said comrade general secretary lizard propaganda broadcasts reportand japanese radio confirmsthat the lizards have detonated an explosivemetal bomb over tokyo they say this was because the japanese were engaged in nuclear research there casualties are said to be very heavy molotov waited to see how stalin would react intending to match his own response to his leaders stalin said the germans were inept and blew themselves up the japanese were careless and let the lizards get wind of what they were about we can afford neither mistake we already knew that but now we are mm strongly reminded once more truth comrade general secretary molotov said stalin did have an eye for the essential not for nothing had he dominated the soviet union these past twenty years molotov wondered whereor ifthe ussr would be in another twenty the engineer in the room next to the broadcast studio gave theyoure on signal through the large window the two rooms shared nodding moishe russie began reading from his yiddish script good day this is moishe russie coming to you by way of the bbcs overseas services another great world capital has fallen to the malice of the lizards he sighed the sigh was part of the script but also heartfelt when the lizards destroyed berlin last year i confess that i was not altogether brokenhearted the germans had done dreadful things to the jews under their control i thought the lizards who helped the jews of poland escape the nazi yoke were our benefactors i was wrong the lizards used us too they were willing to let us live yes but only as their slaves and that holds not just for us but also for all mankind when the lizards destroyed washington they made that plain for anyone with eyes to see when they destroyed washington they showed they were fighting freedom and now tokyo the lizards no longer even try to pretend they come straight out and tell us they dropped one of their hellish bombs on it because the japanese were seeking to build weapons there that could meet them on even terms that some hundreds of thousands of human beings most of them civilians died in the bombing is to the lizards of no consequence mankind has employed one of these bombs against a purely military target the lizards have now incinerated three historic cities seeking to terrify humanity into surrender london from which i am broadcasting has already been bombarded by both hitler and the lizards yet still endures even if in their madness the lizards treat it as they did tokyo the british isles and the british empire will continue not only to endure but also to resist we hope and expect that all of you who are unfortunate enough to live in territory overrun by the aliens yet can hear my voice will continue to resist too in the end we shall prevail he came to the end of the script just as the engineer drew a finger across his throat beaming at the good timing nathan jacobi took over in english rather than yiddish i shall translate moishe russies remarks momentarily first though i should like to note that no one is better qualified to judge the perfidy in the lizards promises than mr russie for he watched them turn what hed thought to be liberation into the enslavement and wholesale murder they bring to the entire world as he said moishe listened to the introduction with half an ear he was picking up more english day by day but remained far from fluent by the time he figured out what most of one sentence meant two others would go by jacobi went through an english version of russies speech for eastern european listeners who had no yiddish since moishe already knew what hed said he did better at following that than he had with the introduction when the engineer signaled that they were off the air he leaned back in his chair and let out a long sigh switching from english to yiddish for moishes benefit the newsreader said i do wonder at times whether any of this does the least bit of good it does moishe assured him when the lizards had me locked up in lodz it wasnt just my english cousin who helped me get out but plenty of jewish fighters from poland they need encouragement and to be reminded theyre not the only people left in the whole world who want to stand up to the lizards no doubt youre right jacobi said you would know better than i having been on the spot i just seem to have spent almost all of the last four years broadcasting messages of hope into occupied europefirst nazioccupied europe now lizardoccupied europewith what looks like very little return for the effort i do want to feel im actually contributing to the war effort the lizards dont like truth any better than the germans did russie answered next to what the nazis were doing in poland they looked good for a moment but that was all they may not be out to exterminate anyone but they are aiming to enslave everyone all over the world and the more people realize that the harder theyll fight back all over the world jacobi repeated that takes thinking about we called it a world war before the lizards came but the americans africa india much of the near eastthey were hardly touched now the whole world really is in play rather hard to imagine moishe nodded it was harder for him than for the british jew jacobi had grown up in london the center of the greatest empire the world had ever known and also closely linked to the united states thinking of the world as a whole had to come easy for him moishes mental horizons hadnt really reached beyond polandindeed seldom beyond warsawuntil the day von ribbentrop and molotov signed the nazisoviet friendship pact and guaranteed that war would not only come but would be disastrous when it came through the glass the engineer motioned russie and jacobi out of the studio they got up quickly another broadcaster or team would soon be taking over the facility sure enough out in the hall stood a tall skinny craggyfaced man with a thick shock of dark hair just beginning to go gray he was looking at his wristwatch and holding a sheaf of typewritten pages like the ones jacobi carried good morning mr blair russie said trotting out his halting english good morning russie eric blair answered he slid off his dark herringbone jacket warm work closed up in the coffin there id sooner be in my shirtsleeves yes warm moishe said responding to the part hed understood blair broadcast for the indian section of the bbc hed lived in burma for a time and had also fought and been badly wounded fighting on the republican side in the spanish civil war somewhere there or perhaps back in england hed picked up a wet cough that was probably tubercular he pulled out a handkerchief to stifle it then said excuse me gentlemen im going to take some tea to get the scaling out of the pipes hes astonishing jacobi murmured in yiddish as blair walked away ive known him to bring up bloody phlegm after a broadcast but youd never imagine anything was the matter if you listened to him over the air blair returned in a moment with a thick white china cup he gulped down the notquitetea made a wry face and hurried into the studio no sooner had he gone inside than the airraid sirens began to wail russie blinked in surprise he heard no lizard jets screaming overhead shall we go down to the shelter in the cellar he asked to his surprise jacobi said no waitlisten moishe obediently listened along with the howling sirens came another sounda brazen clangor he needed a moment to identify why are the church bells ringing he asked theyve never done that before in that was going to be a signal jacobi answered thank god it was one we never had to use what do you mean russie asked what was it for after theluftwaffe began to bomb us they silenced all the bells jacobi said if they ever started ringing again it meantinvasion the church bells rang and rang and rang a wild carillon that raised the hair on moishes arms and at the back of his neck the germans arent going to invade now he said however much it grated on him relations between england and germanoccupied northern france and the low countries had been correct even sometimes approaching cordial since the lizards landed the lizardsoy oyis right jacobi agreed he cocked his head to one side listening to the bells and the sirens i dont hear any lizard airplanes and i dont hear any antiaircraft guns either if they are invading they arent coming down on london where are they then moishe asked as if the newsreader had some way of learning that to which he himself was not allowed access how should i know jacobi answered testily then he answered his own question were in a bbc studio if we cant find out here where can we russie thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand feeling very foolish next thing ill do ill ask a librarian where to find books he hesitated again he still didnt know the overall layout of the bbc overseas section all that well being primarily concerned with his own broadcasting duties jacobi saw his confusion come on well go to the news monitoring service theyll know as much as anyone does a row of wireless sets sat on several tables placed side by side the resultant dinning mix of languages and occasional squeals and bursts of static would swiftly have driven any unprepared person mad the mostly female monitors though wore earphones so each one of them gave heed only to her assigned transmission one phrase came through the babel again and again theyre here a women took off her earphones and got up from her set for a moment probably for a trip to the loo she nodded to jacobi whom she obviously knew i can guess why youre hanging about here dearie she said the buggers have gone and done it parachutists and i dont know what all else in the south and up in the midlands too thats about all anyone knows right now thank you norma the newsreader said thats more than we knew before he translated it for moishe russie who had understood some of it but not all the south and the midlands russie said visualizing a map thats doesnt sound good it sounds as if theyre heading for london from north and south both jacobi interrupted he looked seriously at moishe i dont know how much longer well be broadcasting here for one thing god may know how theyll supply a city of seven million with invaders on both sides of it but i dont ive been hungry before moishe said the germans would have had no logistic problem in keeping the jews of the warsaw ghetto fed they simply hadnt bothered i know that jacobi answered but theres something else too we would have fought the germans with every man we had i dont expect churchill will do anything less against the lizards before long theyll come for us put rifles in our hands give us as many bullets as they happen to have for them and send us up to the front line that had the ring of truth to it it was what russie would have done had he been running the country all the same he shook his head to you theyll give a rifle to me theyll give a medical bag probably with rags for bandages and not much else he surprised himself by laughing whats funny jacobi asked i dont know if its funny or justmeshuggeh moishe said but here ill be a jew going to war with a red cross on my arm i dont know which either jacobi said but you havent gone to war the wars come to you ussmak was afraid the lumbering transport in which his landcruiser rode was big and powerful enough to haul two of the heavy machines at a time but it wasnt much faster than the killercraft the big uglies flew killercraft of the race were supposed to be flying cover missions and making sure no tosevite aircraft got through but ussmak had seen enough war on tosev to know that the races neat carefully developed plans often turned to chaos and disaster when they ran up against real live perfidious big uglies he wondered if this plan had turned to chaos and disaster even before it ran up against the big uglies into the intercom microphone he said i dont see why we were ordered away from fighting the deutsche just when wed finally starting making good progress against them we are males of the race nejas replied the duty of our superiors is to prepare the plans our duty is to carry them out and that shall be done ussmak liked nejas more to the point he knew nejas was a good landcruiser commander somehow though nejas had managed to come through all the hard fighting hed seen with his confidence in the wisdom of his superiors unimpaired not even when ussmak was happy almost to the point of imbecility with three quick tastes of ginger could he sound so certain everything would be all right and nejas didnt even taste neither did skoob the gunner he and nejas had been together ever since the conquest fleet touched down on tosev and he was every bit as enamored of the straight and narrow as his commander now though he said superior sir i believe the driver has a point dividing and shifting effort in combat creates risks some of which may be serious while we and our equipment are transferred to attack the british we grant the deutsche time to recover even to counterattack the deutsche are staggering ready to fall on the tailstumps they dont have nejas insisted the british have seen little of the war till now their miserable little island has been a base for endless mischief against us because it is an island we can conquer it completely remove this threat and then resume our campaign against the deutsche secure in the knowledge that britain can no longer threaten our rear he sounded like the dapper officers who had briefed the landcruiser units as they pulled them out of line against the deutsche those officers had exuded wholesome confidence too so much confidence that ussmak was certain theyd never led males in combat against the big uglies he said i dont think military needs have all that much to do with it or not in the usual way i think more of it comes down to politics how do you mean driver nejas asked the interrogative cough with which he punctuated his question was so loud and explosive ussmak knew he didnt follow at all a good commander yes but a naturalhatched innocent superior sir when straha fled to the big uglies the emperor only knows how many of our plans he took with him they probably know just what we intend to try for the next two years to keep them confused we have to do different things now curse straha may the emperor turn his eye turrets away from him forever now and in the world to come nejas answered fiercely after a moment though he said yes some truth may hatch from that eggshell we before he could finish what he was saying the transport without warning dropped like a stone the chains that held the landcruiser secure in the fuselage groaned and creaked but held ussmaks seat belt held too to his relief so he didnt bounce all over the drivers compartment as the aircraft dove as landcruiser commander nejas had a communications link with the pilot of the transport he said we had to take evasive action against a tosevite killercraft there the machine guns stitched us up a bit but no serious damage we should land without trouble a good place not to have trouble superior sir ussmak agreed and tacked on an emphatic cough to show he really meant it what happened to the big ugly aircraft skoob demanded he had the proper attitude for a gunner he wanted to be sure the foe was gone unfortunately this time the foe wasnt gone nejas said i am told that the tosevite male escaped the british apparently had more aircraft available than we anticipated and are throwing them all into the battle against our forces here and there sheer numbers let some of them get through weve seen that before superior sir ussmak said individually a landcruiser or killercraft of the race was worth some large number of the machines the big uglies manufactured but the tosevites after theyd lost that large number proceeded to manufacture several more when the race lost a machine it and the male or males who crewed it were gone for good nejas might have picked the thought from his head with luck our conquest of this island of british or whatever its name is will make it harder for the big uglies at least in this part of tosev to continue building the weapons with which they oppose us yes superior sir with luck ussmak said hed given up on the idea that the race would get much luck in its struggle with the big uglies maybe along with their aircraft and landcruisers the tosevites manufactured luck in some hidden underground factory nejas broke into his reverie saying we are on the point of landing prepare yourselves sealed up in the landcruiser ussmak hadnt noticed maneuvers less violent than the ones the transport had used to escape the big ugly raider now he braced himself for a jolt as the aircraft touched down it came hard enough to make his teeth click together the airstrip made by combat engineers in country for which hostile was a polite understatement would be short and rough and probably pocked with shell holes too he wondered if any transportsand the males they were transportinghad been caught on the ground things started happening very fast once the transport landed the scream of its engines reversing thrust to help slow it made ussmaks head ache even through the aircraft fuselage and the steel and ceramic armor of the landcruiser deceleration shoved him forward against his seat belt the instant the transport stopped nejas ordered driver start your engine it shall be done superior sir ussmak replied and obeyed the hydrogenburning turbine purred smoothly ussmak stuck his head out through the drivers hatch to get a better view at the moment he did so the nose door of the transport opened swinging up and back over the cockpit while the aircrafts integral ramp rolled down to the ground air from outside flowed into the fuselage bringing with it the smells of powder and dirt and alien growing things it was also cold cold enough to make ussmak shiver the idea of being on an island entirely surrounded by water was less than appealing too back on home land dominated water and islands on the lakes were small and few and far between a male with a lighted red wand ran up to guide the landcruiser out of the transport forwarddead slow nejas ordered ussmak engaged the lowest gear and eased forward the landcruiser rattled over the metal floor of the fuselage then nosed down onto the ramp the male with the wand hadnt done anything but urge ussmak straight aheadhe might as well not have been there the race though tookbetter safe as a general working rule by the way they fought the big uglies had never heard of that rule a buzzing in the air like the wingdrone of a flying biter immensely magnified ussmak hadnt heard that sound often but knew what it meant he ducked back into the landcruiser and slammed the hatch shut the big uglies killercraft shot by at a height not much greater than the top of the transports tail machinegun bullets rattled from the glacis plate of ussmaks landcruiser a couple hit the justclosed hatch had his head been sticking out through it they would have hit him the male whod been directing him out of the transport reeled away blood pouring from two or three wounds forwardtop speed nejas screamed into the microphone taped to ussmaks hearing diaphragm ussmaks foot was already mashing the accelerator if the tosevite killercraft had poured bullets into the front end of the transport what had it done to the rest of the machine superior sir is the other landcruiser following us out he asked with the prisms in the cupola nejas could see all around while ussmaks vision was limited to ahead and a bit to the sides not quickly enough the commander answered and oh hed better hurrytheres flame from one wing of the transport and now from the fuselage and the blast behind him drowned his words the rear of the heavy landcruiser lifted off the ground for a terrifying instant ussmak thought it was going to flip end over end but it thudded back down harder than any of the jolts it had given the crew while the transport took evasive action in the air more explosions followed one after another as the ammunition of the landcruiser trapped in the inferno of the fuselage began cooking off emperors past take the spirits of the crewmales into your hands skoob said may they takeour spirits into their hands too nejas said until that wreck is cleared no traffic will be using the runwayand we need all the traffic we can get more landcruisers more soldiers more ammunition more hydrogen to keep our machines running ussmak hadnt thought of that when hed rolled across the plains of the sssr hed thought the conquest of tosev would be as easy as everyone back on home had expected before the fleet left even though the big uglies had opposed him with landcruisers of their own rather than the animalriding swordswinging soldiers hed been led to expect he and his fellow males disposed of them easily enough even then though things had gone wrong the sniper whod killed his first commander the raider whod wrecked his landcruiserhed been lucky to get out of that alive even if hed had to jump into radioactive mud to do it hed picked up his ginger habit recovering in the hospital ship things had got tougher in france the terrain was worse the deutsche had better landcruisers and they knew what to do with them the francais were hostile too he hadnt thought that would matter but it did sabotage bombings endless nuisances all of which caused damage and forced the males of the race to divert efforts and guard against them and now thistrapped on an island partially cut off from resupply with the big uglies even the ones who werent soldiers certain to be more dangerous than the ones in france superior sir ussmak said the deeper we get into this war the more it looks as if we might lose it nonsense nejas declared the emperor has ordained that we bring this world into the light of civilization and it shall be done ussmak thought him optimistic to the point of idealism but even protesting to a superior was unusual arguing with his commander would have got him punished a male with fancy body paint ran up to the landcruiser waving his arms driver halt nejas said and ussmak did the male clambered up onto the landcruiser ussmak heard nejas open the cupola lid the male shouted his voice deep with excitement yes we can do that superior sir nejas answered him provided you have a clearing blade to fit to the front of the vehicle even really hearing only one side of the conversation ussmak had no trouble figuring out what the male wanted help pushing the wrecked transport off the runway the officer ran off not much later a truck with a winch came rumbling up to the landcruiser combat engineers began attaching the blade not far off dirt suddenly rose into the air in a graceful fountain one of the engineers screamed loud enough for ussmak to hear him through nejas microphone emperor protect us theyve snuck a mortar inside the perimeter again another bomb landed this one even closer fragments of the casing rattled off the sides of the landcruiser a combat engineer went down kicking blood spurted from a wound in his side a medical technician gave him first aid then summoned a couple of other males to take him away for further treatment the rest of the engineers kept on bolting the clearing blade to the landcruiser ussmak admired their courage he wouldnt have done their job for all the moneymaybe not even for all the gingeron tosev for that matter his own job didnt look like such a good risk at the moment mordechai anielewicz huddled in a deep foxhole in the middle of a thick clump of bushes he hoped it would give him good enough cover the forest partisans must have miscalculated how much their raids were annoying the lizards for the aliens were doing their best to sweep them into oblivion firing came from ahead of him and from both sides he knew that meant he ought to get up and move but getting up and moving struck him as the quickest and easiest way to get himself killed sometimes sitting tight was the best thing you could do the lizards were worse in the woods than even an urban jew like him he heard them skittering past his hole in the ground he clutched his mauser if the lizards started poking through the bushes that shielded him hed sell his life as dear as he could if they didnt he had no intention of advertising his existence the essence of partisan warfare was getting away to fight another day time crawled by on leaden feet he took awehrmacht issue canteen from his belt sipped cautiouslyhe had less water than he wanted and didnt know how long it would have to last going out to find more didnt strike him as a good idea not right now the bushes rustledshma yisroayl adonai elohaynu adonai ekhod ran through his head the first prayer a jew learned the last one that was supposed to cross his lips before he died he didnt say it now he might have been wrong but as silently as he could he turned toward the direction of the rustling he was afraid hed have to pop up and start shooting otherwise the lizards could finish him off with grenades shmuel a bare thread of whisper but an unmistakably human voice yes whos that the voice was too attenuated for him to recognize it but he could make a good guess jerzy by way of reply he got a laugh as discreet as the whisper had been you damn jews are too damn smart you know that the partisans point man answered come on though you cant hang around here sooner or later theyll spot you i did if jerzy said staying around wasnt safe it probably wasnt anielewicz scrambled up and out of his hideyhole howd you notice me anyway he asked i didnt think anybody could thats just how the point man answered i looked around and i saw an excellent hiding place that didnt look like it had anyone in it i asked myself who would be clever enough to take advantage of that kind of place your name popped into my head and so i suppose i should be flattered mordechai said you damn poles are too damn smart you know that jerzy stared at him then laughed loud enough to alarm them both lets get out of here he said then quietly once more well head east in the direction theyre coming from now that the main line of them is past we shouldnt have any trouble slipping away theyre probably aiming to drive us against some other force they have waiting thats how the nazis hunted partisans anyhow we caught plenty of you pole bastards too someone behind them said in german they both whirled friedrich sneered at them poles and jews talk too fucking much thats because we have germans to talk about anielewicz retorted he hated the arrogant way friedrich stood there feet planted on the ground as if hed sprung from it every line of his body proclaiming that he thought himself a lord of creation just as if it had been the winter of with the lizards nowhere to be seen and the nazis bestriding europe like a colossus and driving hard on moscow the german glared at him youve got smart answers for everything dont you he said anielewicz tensed a couple of more words to friedrich and somebody was liable to die right there he resolved he wouldnt be the one but then the nazi went on well thats just like a jew youre right about one thingwed better get out of here come on they headed east down a game track mordechai never would have noticed for himself just as if they were raiding rather than running jerzy took the point and friedrich the rear leaving anielewicz to move along in the middle making enough noise to impersonate a large band of men friedrich said this partisan business stinks then he laughed softly course i dont remember hunting you bastards was a whole lot of fun either hunting us bastards mordechai corrected him remember which side youre on now having someone along whod been on both sides could be useful anielewicz had theoretical knowledge of how partisan hunters had operated friedrich had done it if only he werent friedrich up ahead a few meters jerzy let out a hiss hold up he said were coming to a road mordechai stopped he didnt hear friedrich behind him so he assumed friedrich stopped too he wouldnt have sworn to it though he hadnt heard friedrich when they were moving either jerzy said come on up i dont see anything well cross one at a time anielewicz moved up to him as quietly as he could sure enough friedrich was right behind him jerzy peered cautiously from behind a birch then sprinted across the rutted muddy dirt road and dove into the brush there mordechai waited a few seconds to make sure nothing untoward happened then made the same dash and dive himself somehow jerzy had done it silently but the plants he dove into rustled and crackled in the most alarming way his pique at himself only got worse when friedrich who would have made two of him also crossed without producing any noise jerzy cast about for the game trail found it and headed east once more he said we want to get as far away from the fighting as we can i dont know but you feel it too eh friedrich said like somebody just walked over your grave i dont know what it is but i dont like it what about you shmuel no not this time anielewicz admitted he didnt trust his own instincts though not here in the ghetto hed had a finetuned sense of when trouble was coming he didnt have a feel for the forest and he knew it something jerzy muttered just before the shooting started the lizards were ahead of them and off to one flank at the first gunshot mordechai threw himself flat he heard a grunt and a groan from in front of him he groaned toojerzy was hit in lizardaccented polish a tremendously amplified voice roared you have been tracked since you crossed the road surrender or be killed you cannot escape we shall cease fire to allow you to surrender if you do not you will die as promised the hail of bullets stopped by the noises in the trees more lizards were moving up on the side opposite the one from which the shooting had come a helicopter thrummed overhead sometimes visible through the leafy forest canopy sometimes not anielewicz weighed the odds the lizards didnt know who he was that counted for a great dealwhat they didnt know he knew they couldnt squeeze out of him wearily he set down his mauser and got to his feet arms high over his head five or ten meters behind him friedrich was doing the same thing the german managed a wry grin maybe well get away eh that would be good anielewicz agreed hed managed to arrange it for other people he wondered how moishe russie was getting along these days and hed managed to slip out of warsaw right under the lizards snouts whether he could get out of a prison camp once he was inside it was another question though and it was going to be one hed have to answer several lizards all of them with automatic rifles at the ready approached him and friedrich he stood very still not wanting to spook them and get himself shot one of the lizards gestured sharply with the barrel of his gunthis waygo he said in barely understandable polish anielewicz and friedrich shambled into captivity rance auerbach and his troopers rode into lamar colorado after another hitandrun raid into lizardheld kansas a couple of horses had bodies tied across their backs nothing came easy when you fought the lizards but the company had done what it set out to do auerbach turned to bill magruder old joe selig wont play footsie with the lizards any more sir thats a fact and a good thing too magruder answered his face was sootgrimy hed been one of the band that had torched seligs barn the rest of the company had burned seligs farmhouse and selig inside it magruder leaned down and spat right in the middle of main street goddamn collaborator i never thought wed see bastards like that not in the united states me neither auerbach said glumly just goes to show theres some bastards everywhere i guess hate to say ithate to see it by godbut i reckon its true near the railroad station right where main street crossed the santa fe tracks stood the madonna of the trail monument dedicated to all the pioneer mothers too bad some of those pioneer mothers had snakes in the grass for grandchildren a pigeon flew overhead making a beeline for the county courthouse auerbach spotted the little aluminum tube fastened to its left leg spying it took some of the bitter taste out of his mouth id like to see the lizards figure out a way to jam that he said magruder hadnt noticed the bird but he figured out what the captain had to be talking about homing pigeon was it he said at auerbachs nod he went on yeah as long as we stick to the nineteenth century the lizards dont have a clue about what were doing only trouble is when we get up to the here and now we get licked isnt it the truth auerbach said ruefully and if we have the nineteenthcentury stuff and they have the twentieth and the buck rogers gadgets too were going to keep right on getting licked unless were a damn sight smarter than weve been so far the beginning of an idea flickered across his mind but was gone before he could capture it before the war lamar had been a mediumsized town four thousand people maybe a few more unlike a lot of places it was bigger now a lot of the original inhabitants were dead or fled but soldiers made up for a good many of them because it was an important forward base against the lizards and because it remained firmly in american hands it was a magnet for refugees from farther east army headquarters was in the first national bank building not far from the courthouse not that lamar was a big enough town for anything to be real far from anything else auerbach dismissed his troopers to see to their horses then went in to report colonel morton nordenskold the local commander heard him out and made encouraging noises well done he said traitors need to know theyll pay for treason nordenskold had to be from somewhere in the upper midwest his voice held a trace of singsong scandinavian intonation yes sir auerbach felt his own texas drawl coming out more strongly in reaction to that very northern accent what are your orders for the company now sir as usual nordenskold answered observe patrol raid given what we have what else can we do nothing much i can see sir auerbach said uh sir what do we do if the lizards push west with armor the way they did last summer to get into kansas im proud to be a cavalrymandont get me wrongbut you go with horses against tanks once and you wont do it again with the same horses probably not with the same men either i know nordenskold wore a small precise gray mustachetoo small and precise to fluff out when he sighed captain well do the best we can under the circumstances well harass well counterattack when we can he sighed again take away the army guff and a lot of us are going to get killed trying to hold them back any further questions auerbach uh no sir rance answered nordenskold had been more forthright than hed expected things werent good and they werent likely to get better any time soon hed known that but having his superior come right out and say it made it feel as real and immediate as a kick in the teeth dismissed then the colonel said his desk was piled high with papers some of them reports and notes handwritten on the backs of old bank forms he bent to them once more before auerbach was out of the office without electric lights the room where first national bank customers would have stood was dark and gloomy rance blinked several times when he went out into the bright sunshine of the street then he blinked again and touched the brim of his cap with a forefinger in what was more a polite gesture than a salute hello miss penny how are you today im all right i suppose penny summers answered indifferently shed been like that ever since auerbach had brought her back to lamar from lakin kansas nothing seemed to matter much to her he understood that watching your father smashed to cat meat right before your eyes was plenty to leave you stunned for a while you look mighty nice he offered gallantly she was a nicelooking girl true but that wasnt the same thing her face still had a wounded look to it and like a lot of faces in lamar was none too clean she still wore the overalls shed had on when she and her father decided to pitch in and help the cavalry against the lizards in lakin under them she had on a mans shirt that had seen better yearsmaybe better decadesand was also several sizes too big for her she shrugged not because she didnt believe him he judged but because she didnt care one way or the other he tried again the folks youre staying with here are they treating you okay i guess so she said still so flat that he started to give up hope of bringing her back into full contact with the world but then her voice picked up a little as she went on mr purdy he tried peekin at me when i got undressed one night but i told him i was your girlfriend and youd whale the stuffing out of him if he ever did it again i ought to whale the stuffing out of him for doing it once auerbach growled he had definite even vehement notions about what you should and shouldnt do taking advantage of somebody you were supposed to be helping fell with a thud into the second category i told him id tell his wife on him too penny said was that amusement in her voice auerbach wasnt sure but it was something and he hadnt heard anything there since the lizard plane swooped low over her father he decided to risk laughing that was a good idea he said then he asked why did you say you were my girlfriend not that i wouldnt like it if it were so mind you but on account of mr purdy knows you brought me here and he knows youre half his age and twice his size penny summers answered if she noticed the last sentence hed politely tacked on she didnt show it he sighed he wished he could do something for her but had no idea what that something might be when he said goodbye penny only nodded and went on down the street he didnt think she was going anywhere in particular just wandering aroundmaybe she and the purdys got on one anothers nerves in ways other than the one shed mentioned too he turned a corner and headed for the stables funny to think of towns having stables again theyd been going out of business since about the time he was born to see to his horse if you didnt worry about your animal before you worried about yourself you didnt belong in the cavalry somebody sang out hello captain rance sir auerbach whirled only one person called him captain rance to his men he was captain auerbach to his friends he was just ranceor rather hed been just rance the people hed called friends were a lot of duty stations away from lamar colorado sure enough there stood rachel hines grinning at him he grinned back hello yourself where penny weighed down by her fathers death had withdrawn into herself since she came to lamar rachel had blossomed she was still wearing the dress in which shed come to town and it wasnt any too clean but she wore it with a flair penny had forgottenif shed ever known it from god knows where rachel had managed to come by makeup which highlighted her blond good looks and perhaps for no better reason than to keep life interesting she still had her slung over a shoulder or perhaps she did have a reason perhaps she was trying to make a point she walked up to auerbach and said when am i going to get to ride out with your men against the lizards he didnt dismiss the idea out of hand as he would have before the lizards came the position of the united states was in a word desperate in a situation like that whether you could take a leak standing up suddenly looked a lot less important than whether you could ride hard shoot straight and follow orders he studied rachel hines she stared saucily back at him he wasnt sure about that last one not where she was concerned some women wouldnt be any trouble on campaign but rachel enjoyed flaunting what she had that could make trouble so auerbach temporized saying i cant tell you yes or no yet colonel nordenskold is still thinking that one over that had the additional virtue of being more or less true she took another step toward him now she was so close she made him want to take a step back she ran her tongue over her lips which made him notice again that shed painted them red id do just about anything to get the chance to go along she murmured in a breathy little voice he wasnt used to hearing anywhere outside the bedroom the sweat that sprang out on his forehead had nothing to do with the heat of colorado summer women had been few and far between for him this past crazy summer and like a lot of guys he always came back from action horny probably because he was so relieved to be coming back alive but if rachel would go to bed with him to get what she wanted shed do the same thing with somebody else politely in case hed somehow misunderstood her though he knew damn well he hadnt he said im sorry but it isnt in my hands like i said its up to the colonel well ill just have to talk withhim then wont i she sashayed off toward the first national bank auerbach wondered if colonel nordenskold would be able to resist her blandishments and if hed even try the cavalry captain went on to tend to his horse also wondering how much hed regret turning her down damn if shed only wanted something easy from me he muttered under his breath robbing the bank here say leslie groves did not pretend to be a combat general even to himself engineers fought nature and they fought the efforts of illintentioned people in the wrong kinds of uniforms who wanted to knock down the things they ran up they werent supposed to worry about fighting the bad guys not directly on the other hand engineers had to be able to fight in a pinch you never could tell what might happen to the officers who made battle their proper business if enough of them went down you were liable to be the man on the spot for a while so groves had plenty of experience reading situation maps just to keep himself in practice he often tried to figure out strategy for each side with pardonable pride he thought he was pretty good at it when he looked at the situation map on the wall of his office he grimaced you didnt have to be napoleon to realize that if the lizards wanted to they could stroll across colorado and seize denver without breathing hard let alone slowing down whats going to stop them groves snorted cavalry for gods sake he hadnt seen cavalry symbols on a map for a long time hed felt mild pride for remembering what they meant cavalry against the lizards cavalry had had trouble with the sioux indians and he didnt see that the state of the art had improved enough in the past three generations to give the horse soldiers much of a chance of holding off creatures from another planet if the lizards took it into their toothy heads to go after denver cavalry wouldnt be enough to hold them back more armored divisions than the us army owned might not be enough to hold them back either but groves didnt worry about mighthavebeens whatwas posed quite enough difficulties they cant find out were working on the atomic bomb here he announced as if he expected someone to materialize in an empty chair across the desk from him and nod at his wisdom of course if the lizards did find out the metallurgical laboratory had settled down here they probably wouldnt bother mounting an armored drive across colorado theyd just do unto denver what theyd done unto tokyo theyd blow it off the face of the earth if they did that and especially if they did that before the united states had made any bombs the war would be as good as lost at least on this side of the atlantic japans smashed englands invaded he said astonishing how much the destruction of tokyo worried him not much more than a year before jimmy doolittle had won himself a congressional medal of honor for bombing the japanese capital and the whole usa had stood up and cheered nowif we go under now everything rides on the reds and the nazis groves said scowling that was a hell of a thought depending on a couple of the nastiest regimes ever invented to save the day for everybody else living under the lizards might almost be better groves shook his head nothing was worse than living under the lizards he held one finger in the air as if to show hed had a good idea the thing to do is not to let them know he declared so far they hadnt tumbled with luck and care they wouldnt what really worried him though was that they wouldnt have to figure out that the americans were doing nuclear research to want to conquer denver if they decided to head west from where they already were it was the biggest city in sight maybe the met lab team would escape the way they had from chicago but where would they go next he hadnt the faintest idea how much precious time would they lose he didnt know that either but a lot could the united statescould the worldafford to have them lose all that time there for once he knew the answer no he got up from his desk stretched and headed out the door instead of his officers cap he grabbed a civilianstyle fedora he was finally wearing a brigadier generals stars on his shoulders but hed daubed gray paint on them so they wouldnt sparkle and perhaps draw the notice of lizard aerial reconnaissance the last thing he wanted the lizards wondering was what a general was doing on a university campus if they were smart enough to figure out that that meant military research they might also be smart enough to figure out what kind of research it meant in which case goodbye denver the walk to the pile under the football stadium was aside from eating and sleeping almost the only break groves allowed himself in his days of relentless toil off to the east civilians men and women alike were out digging tank traps and trenches those might not come to anything without the soldiers and guns theyd need to make them effective but the civilians were giving their all he could hardly do anything lessand it wasnt in his nature to do anything less anyhow a chart was thumbtacked to a hallway wall of the stadium by the atomic pile it kept track of two things the amount of plutonium produced each day and how much had been produced overall that second number was the one groves watched like a hawk leo szilard came round the corner good morning general he said in the thick hungarian accent that always made grovesand a lot of other peoplethink of bela lugosi something else besides the accent lurked in his voice groves suspected it was scorn for anybody who put on his countrys uniform groves reaction to that was returned scorn but he did his best to hide it he was after all fighting to keep the united states a free country and besides he might have been reading altogether too much into a threeword greeting although other encounters with the physicist made him doubt that good morning dr szilard he answered as cordially as he couldand the chart gave him some reason for cordiality weve been up over ten grams a day this past week thats excellent it is certainly an improvement having the second pile operational has helped a good deal more than half the production now comes from it we were able to improve its design with what we learned from this one thats always the way things go groves said nodding you build the first one to see if it will work and how it will work whatever it happens to be your second ones a better job and by the third or fourth youre about ready to enter regular production adequate theory would enable the first attempt to be of proper quality szilard said now with a touch of frost groves smiled that was just the difference between a scientist who thought theory could adequately explain the world and an engineer who was sure you had to get in there and tinker with things before theyd go the right way groves said were bringing down the time until we have enough plutonium for a bomb every time i look at the chart but next year still isnt good enough we are now doing everything we can here at denver given the materials and facilities available szilard answered if the hanford site is as promising as it appears to be we can begin producing more there soon assuming we can set up the plant without the lizards noticing yes assuming groves said heavily i wish id sent larssen out as part of a team if something goes wrong with him well just have to judge going ahead at hanford on the basis of theory rather than experience szilard gave him a surprised look the physicist owned a sense of humor a rather dry puckish one but seemed surprised to find anything similar lurking in the soul of a military man after a moments hesitation he said the atomic piles we have in mind for that facility are truly elegant and will make these seem like clumsy makeshifts the columbia has enough cooling flow to let them be enormously more efficient getting equipment and people to hanford is going to be complicated groves said getting anything anywhere is complicated these days thats what having aliens occupying half the country will do to you if we do not establish additional facilities our production rate for plutonium here will remain cruelly low szilard said i know groves answered so many things the united states had to do if it was going to win the war so many things also the united states couldnt do and if the united states couldnt do the things it had to do groves was an excellent logician he wished he werent because he hated the conclusion to which logic led him david goldfarb drew himself to attention as fred hipple walked by which meant he looked down on the crown of the diminutive group captains service cap permission to speak to you a moment sir hipple stopped nodded what is it goldfarb the rumble of artillery was plainly audible in the moment goldfarb used to gather his thoughts the lizards northern perimeter was only a few miles away up till now it had been a defensive perimeter their main effort went into the southward push toward london that didnt mean the british were attacking it with any less ferocity though goldfarb said sir id like your endorsement on a request to transfer from this unit to one where i can get into combat i thought that might be what you would say hipple rubbed at the thin line of his mustache your spirit does you credit however i shall not endorse any such request on the contrary as long as this research team exists i shall bend every effort toward maintaining it at full strength he scratched at his mustache again you are not the first man to ask this of me i didnt think i would be sir but this is the first chance ive had to speak to you in any sort of privacy goldfarb said being one of the other ranks he didnt share quarters with hipple as did the officers on the jet propulsion and radar research team stealing this moment outside the nissen hut where they all worked wasnt the same thingalthough the roar of cannon and the cloud of dust and smoke that obscured the southern horizon lent his words urgency yes yes i understand all that quite hipple looked uncomfortable i might add that my own request to return to combat duty was also rejected and i must admit i found the reasons for its rejection compelling enough to apply them myself he shifted from foot to foot a startling gesture from such a usually dapper little man what are those reasons sir goldfarb gestured violently with the country invaded seems to me we need every man who can carry a rifle to do just that hipples smile was rueful exactly what i said though i believe i used the phrase climb into a cockpit instead i was told quite pointedly that this was penny wise and pound foolish that we have a sufficiency of fighting men who are only that and nothing more but that technical progress had to continue lest in winning this fight we sow the seeds of losing the next one and thatyou will forgive me i trust for quoting the words of the air vice marshali was to bloody well stay here till we were either evacuated or bloody well overrun yes sir goldfarb said then greatly daring he added but sir if we lose this fight can we make another a cogent point hipple admitted if by we you mean the british isles i daresay the answer is no but if you mean by it mankind as a whole i believe the answer to be yes and if we are evacuated i believe we shant go into the welsh mountains or up into scotland or across the irish sea to belfast my guess is that they may send us across to norway and from there to join forces with the germansno i dont care for that and i see from your face that you dont either but neither of our opinions has anything to do with anything more likely though wed sail across the atlantic and set up shop in canada or the united states meanwhile we soldier on here is that clear yes sir goldfarb repeated hipple nodded as if everything were settled and went on his way sighing goldfarb walked into the nissen hut basil roundbush was in there poring over a blueprint with a singular lack of enthusiasm he looked up saw goldfarbs hangdog expression and recognized it for what it was the old man wouldnt let you go fight either eh too bloody right goldfarb waved to the sten guns and spare magazines that had gone up on hooks and in bins on the walls of the hut ready to be grabbed i suppose those are there to make us feel like soldiers even if were not roundbush laughed but without much humor thats well put i never should have learned so blinking much if i were just a pilot id be in there battling not chained to a draughtsmans table away from it all one of the meteorologists said if you were just a pilot youd have been in there battling all along and odds are youdve long since bought your plot oh bugger off ralph basil roundbush said for a crack like that he would have beaten most men to a jelly but ralph wiggs had had an artificial leg since the day when a generation before hed gone over the top at the somme having seen that and been lucky enough to survive it he knew everything worth knowing about senseless slaughter now he said oh dont get me wrong lad i tried to get back into it tooif theyd take tinlegs bader to fly a spit with both legs gone why wouldnt they take me to fight with just one blighters said id best serve his majesty by keeping an eye on air pressure and wind direction its a filthy job ralph but someones got to do it roundbush said i just wish id never heard of turbines teach me to be an engineer goldfarb couldnt make complaints like that if he hadnt been mad for wireless sets and the like before the war he wouldnt have become a radarman in the first place hed have gone straight into the infantry he might have come back from dunkirk but then again he might not have so many good chaps hadnt he stuck a lead onto one of the subunits he and leo horton had salvaged from the radar of a crashed lizard fighter little by little they were figuring out what the unit did if not always how it did it just as he was about to take his first reading the airraid alarm began to wail swearing in english and yiddish he dashed for the trench right outside the nissen hut and jumped down into it basil roundbush landed almost on top of him the flight officer clattered as he dove into the trench on the way out hed grabbed several sten guns and enough ammunition to fight a small war when the first lizard plane screamed overhead he fired off a long burst just on the off chance dont you know he shouted to goldfarb through the hellish din bombs slammed down all around jerking them and the other men in the trench around like so many rag dolls odd pattern goldfarb remarked hed become something of a connoisseur of bombing runs usually they go after the runways but it sounds more as though they were hitting the buildings today he stuck up his head thats what they were doing all right most of the huts and barracks and other buildings of the bruntingthorpe experimental air station had just taken a dreadful pounding the nissen hut from which hed fled was still intact but all its windows had blown in roundbush also peered this way and that youre rightnot a scratch on the runways he said that isnt like the lizards not even a little bit its almost as if they wanted them his voice faded before the last word intact no sooner had that passed his lips than goldfarbs battered ears caught a thuttering roar from out of the south it seemed to be coming from the air but hed never heard anything like it then he caught sight of something that reminded him of a tadpole slung beneath an electric fan helicopter he yelled helicopters roundbush corrected grimly and theyre coming this wayprobably want to seize the airstrip goldfarb kept his head up another moment then one of the helicopters let loose with a salvo of rockets he threw himself flat again several of them tore into the nissen hut a piece of hot corrugated iron landed on him like an overaggressive player in a rugby scrum oof he said a couple of precious meteors blew up in their revetments the radarman started to shake the slab of metal off and get up but roundbush sat on him stay low you bloody fool the flight officer shouted as if to underscore his words machinegun bullets kicked up dirt all around when a fighter plane strafed you it made its pass and flew on the helicopters hung in the air and kept shooting and shooting over the racket of the guns goldfarb said i think group captain hipples research team has just broken up too bloody right it has roundbush answered here give me one of those sten guns ralph wiggs said if theyre going to shoot us we may as well shoot back as long as we can the middleaged onelegged meteorologist sounded a great deal calmer than goldfarb felt after the somme wiggs might not have found a mere airborne invasion worth showing excitement over roundbush passed him a submachine gun wiggs pulled the bolt back stuck his head up and started shooting regardless of the bullets still raking the trench the somme had been machinegun hell hundreds of them firing at the overburdened british troops slogging toward their positions next to that what the lizards were throwing at bruntingthorpe had to seem negligible if wiggs could get up and fight goldfarb supposed he could also manage it he peered over the lip of the trench the helicopters still hovered above the runway covering the lizards who skittered along the tarmac shooting as they ran goldfarb blazed away at them several of them went down but whether hed hit them or they were just taking cover he could not say all at once one of the helicopters turned into a bluewhite fireball goldfarb whooped like a red indian antiaircraft guns ringed bruntingthorpe nice to know that aside from almost shooting down british jet fighters they could also do some damage to the enemy the remaining helicopter whirled in the air and fired more rockets at the ackack gun that had brought down its companion goldfarb couldnt imagine anyone living through such a barrage but the gun kept pounding away then the helicopter lurched in the air goldfarb screamed louder than he had before the helicopter did not explode but did flee trailing smoke basil roundbush bounded out of the trench and fired at the lizards on the ground who had halted in dismay we have to wipe them out now he shouted before they get their air cover back goldfarb got up onto the greensward too though he felt horribly naked outside the trench he fired a burst went down on his belly wriggled forward and fired again other men came up and started shooting too from their slit trenches from others and from the wreckage of the buildings the lizards had bombed ralph wiggs limped straight toward the lizards as if this were all over again a bullet caught him he went down but kept on shooting you hurt badly goldfarb asked wiggs shook his head i took one through the knee there so i cant walk but otherwise im right as rain he fired again he didnt sound like a man whod just been shot goldfarb stared for a moment then realized the lizard bullet must have wrecked the knee of wiggs artificial leg even out in the open with precious little cover and bullets whistling all around he burst out laughing they cant have more than two squads on the ground roundbush said we can take them i really think we can as if to underline his words the antiaircraft gun the helicopters hadnt been able to silence opened up on the lizard infantry using ackack as regular artillery was unconventional although the germans were supposed to have started doing it as far back as their blitzkrieg through france in it was also deucedly effective goldfarb scurried forward toward some wreckage strewn over the runway he got in behind it with a grateful belly flop any bit of cover was welcome he poked the barrel of his sten gun up over the edge of the torn wood and metal and blazed away hold fire somebody yelled from across the runway theyre trying to give up one weapon at a time the insane rattle of smallarms fire died away goldfarb ever so cautiously raised his head and peered toward the lizards hed seen them as blips on a radar screen and briefly in the raid on the prison in lodz that had freed his cousin moishe russie now as the survivors of the force threw down weapons and raised hands high he got his first good look at them they were only the size of kids hed known that intellectually hed even seen it for himself but it hadnt really registered on an emotional level the lizards technology was so good that they seemed nine feet tall except for size they didnt remind him of children with their forwardslanting posture and scaly skins they looked something like dinosaurs but their helmets and armored jackets gave them a martial airprobably a better martial air than he had himself right now he thought glancing down at his grimy raf uniform basil roundbush tramped up beside him by jove we did it he said so we did goldfarb knew he sounded surprised but couldnt help it he was surprised to be alive much less victorious musingly he went on i wonder if one of those bulletproof waistcoats would fit me now theres a thought roundbush exclaimed he appraised goldfarb with his eyes youre smaller and leaner than i am so you stand a chance i hope for your sake one does because the time for research in merry old england i fear is past he kicked at a broken slide rule lying on the tarmac till we throw those scaly buggers out theres nothing but fighting left o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams what the devil was that frommacbeth hamlet king lear jens larssen was damned if he could remember but it was something out of shakespeare sure as hell the lines came floating up into his conscious mind the moment he reached the top of lewiston hill looking west from the hilltop he could certainly count himself a king of infinite space even in a land full of spectacular scenic vistas this one stood out there was the endless rolling sagebrush prairie of washington statedesert might have been a more accurate name for it if less kind nearer though were the towns of clarkston washington and on this side of the snake river lewiston idaho itself nestled between the snake and the clearwater with mountains pinching it off north and south so that at first glance it seemed to consist of nothing but one long street rafts of logs floated on the snake to head downstream to be made into who could say what to help fight the lizards as if the clock had turned back a generation more and more aircraft parts were wood these days but did jens really care these days how the war against the aliens went having the lizards conquer the world was a nightmare of a bad dream but when the people who had the best chance of stopping them were also the people whod done him the most dirt how was he supposed to feel like hell he announced to the air and kicked his bicycle into motion to roll down into lewiston roll down intowere the operative words in the ten miles between lewiston hill and lewiston itself us dropped two thousand feet about a four percent average grade averages were trickyit was a lot steeper than that in some places and going downhill was the easy way if he came back by this route hed have the long slog up to the summit of the hill just thinking about it made his thighs ache lewiston bustled in a way he hadnt seen since he left denver or maybe since he left chicago loggers swaggered down the street so did sawmill workers not all the timber cut around here headed into washington not by a long shot the bulk of what had to be one of the worlds biggest lumber plants was just a mile down the clearwater by the smoke that poured from its chimneys it was going flat out too the world was a big place too big for the lizards to knock out every factory in it no matter how thoroughly destructive they were the sawmill was interesting in the abstract but it didnt make jens want to stop for a closer look when he came up to a ymca building though he stopped so hard he almost pitched himself over the handlebars of his bicycle several bikes were parked out front with a pistoltoting guard to keep an eye on them larssen had seen that in denver and elsewhere too bicycles now were what horses had been in the old dayscome to that there were also a good many horses on lewistons streets jens nodded to the guard as he let down the kickstand to his bike when he went inside he asked the clerk at the front desk you have hot water yes sir the man answered unfazed by the sudden appearance of a grimy stranger with a knapsack and a rifle on his back hed probably seen a lot of such strangers for he went on a hot shower is two dollars if you want a shave you can use a straight razor andhmmprobably a scissors for you too for another fifty cents if youll give me your goods there you can have them back when you pay larssen passed him the springfield and the knapsack thanks pal ill take a miss on the razor im used to the beard by now a lot of men say the same thing the clerk answered nodding if you want your clothes washed too chungs laundry down the street does a firstclass job im just passing through so i dont think i can stay for that but thanks again jens said but a hot shower hot dog he followed the signs back to the shower room as promised the water was hot almost hot enough to scald the soap took off not only the dirt but part of his top layer of hide too it was obviously homemade mushy and full of lye and strongsmelling but when he turned off the water and toweled himself dry he was pink again not assorted grimy shades of brown putting stale clothes over his clean body made him wrinkle his nose hed been rank for so long hed stopped noticing it maybe hed stop at chungs after all he combed back his hair and walked out to the front desk whistling when he gave the clerk a couple of dollar bills he got his chattels back he checked the knapsack to make sure nothing was missing the clerk looked pained but said nothing hed probably seen that a hundred times too jens tossed the bike guard a dime climbed onto his machine and headed toward the bridge over the snake that would lead into washington state a couple of blocks west of the ymca as the clerk had said was chungs laundry with chinese characters below the english name of the shop jens was about to roll past it however regretfully when he saw the place simply called mamas next door he stopped if this chung worked fast maybe he could get his clothes washed while he had a leisurely lunch why the hell not he muttered an hour this way or that wasnt enough to worry about the laundrymanhis first name you learned inside was horacespoke perfect english he giggled when larssen said he was going into mamas for lunch but promised to have his clothes ready in an hour when jens opened the door to mamas place he didnt smell the friendly odors of homecooked food hed expected perfume hit him in the nose instead the joint reeked like a cathouse after a moment he realized the jointwas a cathouse it made sense all those lumberjacks would want something to do besides chopping down trees all day but no wonder horace lung had broken up when he said he was coming over here to eat a big blowsy woman maybe mama herself came out of a back room jens rifle didnt seem to bother her either aint you squeaky clean she said eyeing his justwashed face and damp hair bet you been over to the y thats right thoughtful of you it sure is now come on back with me and pick yourself out a pretty girl jens opened his mouth to tell her hed thought the place was a restaurant but then he shut it again and followed her he wasnt going anywhere till the laundryman got done with his clothes and this would be more fun than lunch the girls werent particularly pretty no matter what mama said and most of them looked mean the lingerie they were wearing had seen better years he wondered again if he really wanted to do this but then he found himself nodding to a girl with curly dark blond hair she looked a little like barbara had back when they were married but he didnt notice that he just thought she was the bestlooking woman there she got up and stretched as she headed for the stairs she said a straight screw is forty ten bucks more than that for halfandhalf another ten for french you want anything else find yourself a different gal that bald announcement almost made jens turn on his heel and walk out if horace chung hadnt had his clothes he might have done it as it was he went after the hooker the linen on the bed in the little upstairs room was frayed but clean larssen wondered if horace did the laundry for mamas place and if so how he got paid the girl kicked off her shoes pulled her nightgown up over her head and stood impassively naked whatll it be buddy tell me your name at least jens said unnerved by such straightforward capitalism edie she answered and didnt bother asking his instead she repeated whatll it be halfandhalf i guess he said with dull embarrassment show me the money first you dont pay you dont play she nodded when he tossed the bills onto the bed then warned you come while im sucking you you gotta pay the extra ten for full french okay okay okay he shook his head horny and disgusted with himself at the same time this wasnt what hed been used to getting in his happier days it bore about as much resemblance to love as the painting on an orange crate did to the mona lisa but it was all he could find right now he shrugged out of his knapsack set it and the springfield in a corner by the bed then he undressed edie looked him over like somebody inspecting a slab of meat as mama had she said youre clean anyhow thats something havent seen you round these parts before you stop at the y before you came here yeah i did he answered cherishing any human contact between them it was the first thing shed said to him that wasnt strictly business it was also the last sit on the edge of the bed will you she asked when he did she got down on her knees in front of him and went to work she knew what she was doing no doubt about that presently he patted the mattress with one hand she lay down on the bed her legs open she didnt respond when he caressed her but gave him a good professional ride after he got on top afterwards the first thing she did was scoop up the money he was dressing again when he realized he hadnt put on a rubbertoo bad for her he thought coldly if you were in her line of work you took your chances with things like the clap she said you want another round half price no thats all right he answered what he was thinking about was going back to the ymca for another shower he probably had time but he didnt feel like explaining himself to the desk clerkor not explaining himself but bearing up under the guys fishy stare you want a drink downstairs then edie asked we got homebrew beer moonshine even a little real whiskey if you feel like payin for it she should have been peddling used cars instead of her ass and related amenities thats all right jens said again all he wanted to do was get the hell out of there edies look saidcheapskate he ignored it when he went back into chungs laundry the proprietor asked you have a nice lunch sir and giggled louder than he had the first time then he called something in chinese into the back room a womans laugh floated out jens ears felt on fire he thought seriously about abandoning his clothes and riding west as fast as he could go in the end he decided to stay but as soon as horace chung handed him the hot laundry he shoved it into his knapsack and fled without changing and getting the clothes he had on cleaned as hed intended to do the steel suspension bridge over the snake river was historythe lizards hadnt missed it as they had the sawmill the only way across the river was by rowboat the oarsmen all wanted fifteen bucks for the trip too jens flashed his letter that said he was on important government business one of the boatmen said im as patriotic as the next guy mac but i gotta feed my face jens paid eastern washington as seen from us reminded him of utah very fertile when next to a river or irrigated otherwise pale alkali flats with not much more than sagebrush growing on them hed always thought of washington as full of pines and moss and ferns with water dripping everywhere all the time this part of the state didnt live up to the description the roads hereabout hadnt been badly bombed most of the bridges over rivers smaller than the snake remained intact timber makeshifts let light traffic cross some of the spans that had been destroyed from the air a couple of times he had to pay his way across he got his ashes hauled again in walla walla on the third day after hed crossed into washington again he picked a dark blond girl again he didnt think anything of it this time he didnt have any laundry to reclaim when he left the bordello he knew nothing but relief that that was so about thirty miles west of walla walla us swung north along the eastern bank of the columbia toward its junction with the snake the country had been irrigated farmland once upon a time some of it looked to have been abandoned for quite a while maybe the farmers hadnt been able to pay their water bills other stretches though especially where the two big rivers joined were just now fading irrigation ditches were nothing but muddy weedchoked grooves in the ground here and there farmers still cultivated small orchards and berry patches but big stretches of land between them baked brown under the summer sun jens wondered what had gone wrong till he pedaled past the ruins of a pumping station and then of another if the water couldnt reach land the land wouldnt bear the town nearest the snake river bridge not that jens expected to find it standing was called burbank just before he got into it he pulled off the highway to contribute his own bit of irrigation to the roadside plants no sooner had he started to piss than he stopped again with a snarl of pain now he knew without having to think about it what that burning meant anotherdose of clap he howled to the sky though that was not where hed got it the next week or two till things calmed down in there were going to be anything but fun then half to his own surprise he started to laugh from everything hed heard the clap didnt usually make a woman as sore as it did a man but that didnt mean she didnt have it and this time there was every chance hed given as goodor as badas hed got when nikifor sholudenko poked his head unannounced into the underground chamber where ludmila gorbunova slept and rested between missions her first thought was that the nkvd man hoped to catch her half dressed but sholudenko said comrade pilot you are ordered to report to colonel karpovs office at once that was different that was business ludmila jumped to her feet thank you comrade take me to him at once please colonel feofan karpov was not a big man but in his square solidity reminded ludmila of a bear nonetheless the stubble on his chin and the decrepit state of his uniform only added to the impression so did the candles flickering in the underground office they gave the place the look of a lair good day comrade pilot karpov said after returning ludmilas salute his voice which was on the reedy side did not sound particularly ursine not even when he growled that will be all comrade at sholudenko but the nkvd man disappeared even so good day comrade colonel ludmila said i report to you as ordered at ease ludmila vadimovnayoure not in trouble certainly not from me karpov said ludmila did not ease the colonel was a stickler for military formality and not in the habit of addressing her by name and patronymic the first reason she came up with for his changing his tune was that he was going to make advances at her if he did she decided shed scream but instead of coming around the desk to lay a comradely hand on her shoulder or any such thing he said i have orders for you to report to moscow immediately well not quite immediately he made a wry face a wagon is waiting above ground to transport you it brought a replacement pilot and a replacement mechanic a replacement mechanic comrade colonel ludmila asked puzzled dakarpov scowled an angry bears scowl they are robbing me not only of one of my best pilots in you but also of that germanschultzyou roped into this unit whatever bungler theyve sent me he wont measure up to the german engines dont care if youre a fascist the prospect of riding in to moscow with georg schultz was less than appealing the prospect of being paired with him on whatever mission followed the trip to moscow was downright appalling hoping she might find out why the two of them had been ordered to the capital she asked where and to whom are we to report comrade colonel to the kremlin or whatever may be left of the kremlin after the lizards have done their worst karpov looked down at a scrap of paper on his desk the order is signed by a certain colonel boris lidov of the peoples commissariat for the interior he saw ludmila stiffen you know this man yes i know him comrade colonel ludmila said in a small voice she glanced around out through the doorway to see if anyone was loitering in the hall karpovs gaze followed hers an nkvd bastard eh he said roughlybut he didnt raise his voice either i thought as much just from the way the order was framed no help for it that i can see go gather your belongings and get into the wagonyoull see it when you come out of the tunnels here wear something civilian if you can it will make you less likely to be shot at from the air and good luck to you ludmila vadimovna thank you comrade colonel ludmila saluted again then walked back down the hall to her chamber mechanically she packed up her flight suit coveralls and pistol she had no civilian blouses but at the bottom of her duffel bag she did find a flowered skirt she couldnt remember the last time shed worn it when she came out of the tunnels she blinked like a mole suddenly in daylight as she replaced the grasscovered netting that concealed the entrance as colonel karpov had said a highwheeledpanje wagon waited there the driver in the baggy blouse trousers and boots of themuzhik the horse making the most of the moment by pulling up weeds the wagon carried a load of straw when georg schultz sat up in it he looked like a scarecrow although ludmila had never seen a scarecrow with a coppery beard he was dressed in his oldwehrmacht tunic and red army trousers he didnt have any civilian clothes this side of wherever in germany he came from he grinned at her come on back here with meliebchen he said in his mixture of russian and german one minute she rummaged in her pack until she found the tokarev automatic pistol she belted it on then climbed into the wagon you never listen to me when i tell you to keep your hands where they belong maybe you will listen to this maybe he was still grinning hed faced worse things than pistols and maybe not the driver twitched the reins the horse let out a resentful snort raised its head and ambled off toward moscow the driver whistled something from mussorgskyafter a moment ludmila recognized it as the great gate of kiev she smiled at the reference no matter how oblique to her hometown but the smile quickly faded kiev had passed from the nazis hands straight into those of the lizards although they moved ever farther from the front line the countryside showed the scars of war bombs had cratered the dirt road that ran northeast toward moscow every couple of hundred meters it seemed thepanje wagon had to rattle off onto the verge georg schultz sat up again spilling straw in all directions these stinking dirt roads played hell with us all through russia the map would say we were coming up to a highway and itd either be dust and dirt like this or mud when it rained didnt seem fair you damn russians were so backwards it ended up helping you the driver didnt move a muscle he just kept driving in spite of that ludmila would have bet he knew german if he was from the nkvd hed have more talents than his roughhewn exterior revealed every so often theyd pass the dead carcasses of tanks rocketed from the air by the lizards before they ever reached the front some had been there long enough to start rusting most had their engine compartments and turret hatches open the soviets had salvaged whatever they could from the wreckage even as scrap metal the ts looked formidable pointing to one ludmila asked with no small pride and what did you think of those when you were up against them comrade panzer gunner nasty buggers schultz answered promptly ignoring the ironic form of address good armor good gun good engine good tracksall better than anything we had probably the gunsight not so good not the twoman turret eitherthe commanders too busy helping the gunner to command the panzer and thats his proper job he should have a cupola too and you need more panzers with wireless sets not having them hurt your tactics and they werent that great to begin with now ludmila hoped the driver was listening shed been aiming to twit the german tankman she hadnt expected such a serious thoughtful answer being a nazi didnt automatically make a man a fool no matter what propaganda claimed the journey in to moscow took two days they spent the first night in a stand of trees well off the road the lizards still flew by at night smashing up whatever they could find moscow when they finally reached it made ludmila gasp in dismay shed last been there the winter before after shed flown molotov to germany the soviet capital had taken a beating then now now it seemed that every building possibly large enough to contain a factory had been pounded flat a couple of the onion domes of the kremlin and st basils had crumpled walls everywhere were streaked with soot the faint odor of wet stale smoke hung in the air but people hadnt given upbabushkas sold apples and cabbages and beets on street corners soldiers carrying submachine guns tramped purposefully along horsedrawn wagons some small like the one in which ludmila rode others pulled by straining teams rattled and clattered no guessing what they held not with tarpaulins lashed down tight over their beds if the lizards couldnt see what was in them they wouldnt know what to bomb flies droned around lumps of horse dung the driver knew which bridge over the moscow river was in good enough repair to get them up to the kremlin and which parts of the battered heart of moscowof the soviet unionwere still beating he pulled thepanje wagon up in front of one of those parts stuck a feed bag on the horses head and said i am to escort you to colonel lidov but for the snatches of whistling hed let out from time to time that was almost the first sound hed made since he set out from the air base some of the walls in the corridor were cracked but the electric lights worked off in the distance a petrolfired generator chugged away to keep the lightbulbs shining wishwe had electricity schultz muttered under his breath the corridor was not the one down which ludmila had gone on her earlier meeting with boris lidov she wondered if that part of the kremlin still stood the wagon driver opened a door peered inside beckoned to her and to georg schultz he will see you ludmilas heart pounded in her chest as if she were about to fly a combat mission she knew she had reason to be nervous the nkvd could kill you as readily and with as little remorse as the germans or the lizards and lidov had made plain what he thought of her after she got back from germany she might have gone to agulag then rather than back to her unit the nkvd colonel ludmila wondered if his promotion sprang from ability or simply survival looked up from a paperstrewn desk she started to report to him in proper military form but schultz beat her to the punch saying breezily how goes it with you boris you scrawny old prunefaced bastard staring ludmila waited for the sky to fall it wasnt that the description didnt fit it did like a glove but to say what you thought of an nkvd colonel right to his prune face maybe he didnt follow german he did fixing schultz with a fishy stare he answered in german much better than ludmilas just because otto skorzeny could get away with speaking to me so sergeant does not mean you can he was more valuable than you are and he was not under soviet discipline you on the other hand he let that hang perhaps to give schultz the chance to paint horrid pictures in his own mind it didnt work schultz said listen i was one of the men you sent on the raid that gave you people the metal for your bomb if that doesnt buy me the right to speak my mind what does nothing lidov said coldly ludmila spoke up before schultz got himself shot or sent to a camp and her along with him comrade colonel for what mission have you summoned the two of us away from the front line lidovs look suggested hed forgotten she was there and utterly forgotten hed ordered the two of them to moscow for any specific reason after a moment he collected himself and even laughed a little that amazed ludmila who hadnt suspected he could then he explained curiously enough it has to do with sovietgerman friendship and cooperation hed answered ludmila in russian he translated the reply into german for schultzs benefit the panzer gunner laughed too till the lizards came i was giving you cooperation all right fifty millimeters at a time what are we to do comrade colonel ludmila asked hastily lidov had warned georg schultz twice even once would have been surprising thinking hed forbear three times running was asking for a miracle and ludmila a good product of the soviet educational system did not believe in miracles lidovs chair squeaked as he turned in it to point to a map pinned to the rough plaster on the side of the wall here by the lakedo you see it is the city of pskov it is still in the hands of mankind although threatened by the lizards some of the defenders arewehrmacht troops others partisan members of the red army he paused and pursed his lips some friction in the defense has resulted from this you mean theyre shooting at each other dont you schultz asked ludmila had wondered if he was too naive to see what lay beneath propaganda but he proved he wasnt gobbels probably used the same techniques as his soviet counterparts which would have sensitized schultz to them not at present lidov said primly nonetheless examples of cooperation might prove to have a valuable effect there the two of you have done an admirable job of working together by all the reports that have reached me we havent worked together all that close schultz said with a sidelong glance at ludmila not as close as id like she wanted to kick him right where it would do the most good by which you mean i dont care to be your whore she snarled before she said something worse to him something irremediable she turned to boris lidov comrade colonel how are we to get to pskov i could have you sent by train lidov answered north of moscow rail service works fairly well but instead i have a u waiting at a field not far from here the aircraft itself will prove useful in defending pskov as will the addition of a pilot and a skilled mechanic who can also serve a gun now goyou spent too much time getting here but i was unwilling to detach a plane from frontline service ludmila was unsurprised to find the driver waiting for them when they left colonel lidovs office the driver said i will take you to the airport now georg schultz scrambled up into thepanjewagon he reached out a hand to help ludmila join him and laughed when she ignored it as if shed done something funny once more she felt like kicking him being sent to pskov was one thing being sent there in the company of this smirking lecherous lout was something else again she brightened for a moment at least she would be escaping nikifor sholudenko andexquisite irony maybe his reports on her had helped make that possible but her glee quickly faded for every sholudenko she escaped she was only too likely to find another one his kind was a hardy breedlike any other cockroachesshe thought atvar nervously pondered the map that showed the progress of the races invasion of britain in one respect all was well the british could not stop the thrusts of his armored columns in another respect though the picture was not as bright the races armor controlled only the ground on which it sat at the moment territory where it had been but was no longer seethed with rebellion the moment the landcruisers were out of sight the trouble with this cursed island he said jabbing a fingerclaw at the computer display as if it were actually the territory in question is that its too small and too tightly packed with tosevites fighting there is like trying to hold a longball game in an airlock well put exalted fleetlord kirel let his mouth fall open in an appreciative chuckle atvar studied the map with one eye and the shiplord with the other he still mistrusted kirel a properly loyal subordinate would have played no role in the effort to oust him yes next to straha kirel was a paragon of virtue but that was not saying enough to leave the fleetlord comfortable atvar said the cost in equipment and males for territory gained is running far higher than the computer projections weve lost several heavy transports and we cannot afford that at all without the transport fleet well have to use starships to move landcruisers aboutand that would leave them vulnerable to the maniacal tosevites truth exalted fleetlord kirel hesitated then went on at best computer projections gave us less than a fifty percent chance of succeeding in the conquest of britain if the campaign in the sssr was not satisfactorily concluded first kirel remained unfailingly polite but atvar was not in the mood for criticism the computers reasoning was based on our ability to shift resources from the sssr after we conquered it he snapped true we did not conquer it but we have shifted resourcesafter the soviets exploded that atomic bomb weve scaled back operations in their territory this produces something of the effect the computer envisioned even if by a different route yes exalted fleetlord if kirel was convinced he did a good job of hiding it he changed the subject but not to one more reassuring we are down to our last hundred antimissiles exalted fleetlord that is not good atvar said an understatement that would do until a bigger one came along which wouldnt be any time soon as was his way he did his best to look on the bright side of things at least we can concentrate those missiles against deutschland the only tosevite empire exploring that technology at the moment you are of course correct kirel said then he and the fleetlord stopped and looked at each other in mutual consternationand understanding with the race saying something was not happening at the moment meant it would not happen certainly not in a future near enough to require worry with the big uglies it meant what it said and nothing more it was no guarantee that the americans or the russkis or the nipponese or even the british wouldnt start lobbing guided missiles at the race tomorrow or the day after even more unnerving both males had come to take that possibility for granted with the tosevites you couldnt tell kirel tried again we continue to expend the antimissile missiles at a rate of several per day we also seek to destroy the launchers from which the deutsch missiles come but we have had only limited success there as they are both mobile and easy to conceal any success on tosev seems limited atvar said with a sigh we might do better to blast the factories in which the missiles are manufactured if the deutsche cannot produce them they cannot fire them and missiles require great precision if we destroy the tools needed to make them the big uglies will be a long while coming up with more he realized he was once more reduced to buying time against the tosevites but that was better than losing to them this course is also being attempted kirel said but while it pains me to contradict the exalted fleetlord the tosevite missiles are astonishingly crude their guidance is so bad as to make them no more than area weapons extremely longrange artillery but the prospect of large weights of high explosive landing behind our lines remains unpleasant some have evaded our countermeasures and done considerable damage and that situation will grow far worse as we run out of countermissiles the corresponding point is that they are far easier to build than the missiles that shoot them down we attack factories weve identified as producing missile components but the deutsche continue to produce and launch the pestilential things atvar sighed again there in an eggshell was the story of the war against the big uglies the race took all the proper steps to contain themand got hurt anyhow a screen on his desk lit up showing the features of his adjutant pshing atvar immediately started to worry pshing wouldnt interrupt his conference with kirel for anything that wasnt important which meant in practice for anything that hadnt gone wrong what is it atvar demanded putting a fierce snarl into the interrogative cough forgive me for troubling you exalted fleetlord pshing said nervously but fzzek commander of invasion forces in britain has received under sign of truce a disturbing message from churchill the chief minister to the petty emperor of britain he requests your orders on how to proceed give me the message atvar said it shall be done pshing swung an eye turret to one side evidently reading the words from another screen this churchill demands that we begin evacuating our forces from britain in no more than two days or face an unspecified type of warfare the tosevites have not yet employed against us but one which is asserted to be highly effective and dangerous if this churchill uses nuclear arms against us we shall not spare his capital atvar said the island of britain is so small a few nuclear weapons would utterly ruin it exalted fleetlord churchill specifically denies the weapons he describes are nuclear in nature pshing replied they are new they are deadly past that the british spokesmale declined detailed comment having begun the conquest of britain we are not going to abandon it on the sayso of a tosevite atvar said you may tell fzzek to relay that to churchill for all we know the big ugly is but running an enormous bluff we shall not allow ourselves to be deceived relay that to fzzek as well it shall be done pshing said the screen holding his image went blank atvar turned back to kirel sometimes the presumption tosevites show astonishes me they treat us as if we were fools if they have a new weapon which i doubt advertising it will produce nothing from us especially since weve seen for ourselves what liars they are exactly so exalted fleetlord kirel said mutt daniels crouched in ruins hoping the lizard bombardment would end soon if it dont end soon there aint gonna be nothin left of chicago he muttered under his breath whats that lieutenant dracula szabo asked from the shelter of a shell hole not far away before mutt could answer several lizard shells came in close enough to slam him down as if hed been blocking the plate when a runner bowled him over trying to score he thanked his lucky stars hed been breathing out rather than in a blast could rip your lungs to bits and kill you without leaving a mark on your body come on he said and charged west across the ruined lawn of poro college toward the rubble that had been shops and apartments on the other side of south park way szabo followed at his heels somewhere close by a lizard opened up with an automatic rifle daniels didnt know whether the bullets were intended for him and didnt wait to find out he threw himself flat ignoring the bricks and stones on which he landed bricks and stones could hurt his bones but bullets he shuddered not caring for the parody on the old rhyme bela szabo returned five with his bar aint this a hell of a mess he called to mutt you might say that yeahyou just might mutt answered off to the west some americans still fought in the swift and armour plants every so often little spatters of gunfire rang out from that direction the plants themselves were worse rubble than the bronzeville wreckage amidst which he crouched the lizards had finally pushed around them and driven halfway toward lake michigan that put them and chicagos american defenders smack in the middle of bronzeville chicagos black belt nobody had any real solid claim to the land between the packing plants and where mutt now lay dracula jerked a thumb back at what had been in happier times poro college what the hell kind of place was that anyways he asked i seen pictures of colored women all gussied up scattered along with all the other junk that there was what they call a beauty college said mutt whod seen a sign on the ground i guess thats where you went to learn how to gussy up colored folk like you said not me lieutenant dracula said not me neither but somebody mutt answered like most white men from mississippi he automatically thought of negroes as ignorant sharecroppers who were fine as long as they kept to their place barnstorming against black ballplayers in the winter and endless travels through the north and west where things worked a little differently had softened his attitude without destroying it that complicated life at the moment because bronzeville held along with lizard assault troops and american defenders and counterattackers a fair number of negro civilians living in cellars and makeshift shelters cobbled together from the wreckage of what had once been fine houses they were nonpareil scavengers that theyd stayed alive in the hell chicago had become proved as much they found all sorts of goodiescanned food medicine sometimes even smokes and boozefor the army units fighting hereabouts but not for mutt as soon as they heard his drawl they dummied up one more forthright than the rest said mistuh we came noth to git away from that kind o talk as if picking the worry from mutts mind dracula szabo said lieutenant we gotta get some more help from the spooks around here i mean i aint the worst scrounger ever born youre a sandbaggin son of a bitch is what you are dracula daniels answered szabo was the best scrounger hed ever seen and hed seen some real pros americans and english and especially frenchmen in france during the first world war hadnt been for dracula the platoon would have been hungrier and grouchier mutt still had a couple of precious cigarettes stashed against a day when hed have to smoke one or die dracula grinned unabashed as if mutt hadnt spoken he took up where hed left off but the thing of it is the spooks know where most of the stuff is account of theyre the ones who stashed it in the first place im just goin around maybe finding things by luck know what i mean lucks a handy thing no doubt about it but having an angles a damn sight better he spoke with the calm assurance of a man who tucked an ace up his sleeve every now and again im not saying youre wrong kid tell you whatnext time were tryin to get somethin from em you handle it tell em the lieutenant made you the official us army special duty supply bloodhound for the platoon well see how that goes for a whileif we dont get pushed outta here and dont walk into a shell okay lieutenant if thats how you want it szabo kept his voice so carefully neutral that mutt had to put his sleeve up against his mouth to keep from laughing out loud he knew hed just given the fox the keys to the henhouse dracula would be scrounging for himself not just for the platoon and hed turn a handsome profit on some of the things he came up with but he was smart enough to do that after the things that really needed doing or hed better be smart enough because if he wasnt mutt would land on him like a ton of bricks from somewhere back not far from the shore of lake michigan a mortar started lobbing bombs onto the lizards over on calumet avenue come on mutt shouted and ran forward toward a house that was more or less intact the men he led came with him rifles and submachine guns banging away as they sprinted from one piece of cover to the next more bombs fell these just ahead of the advancing americans so close that a couple of fragments flew past daniels with an ugly whistling noise the mortars chewed up the landscape even worse than it was already mutt peered out from behind a corner of the house fired a burst at what might have been a lizard even if it probably wasnt and ran forward again to flop down behind a pile of bricks that once upon a time had been somebodys chimney he rested there for a couple of minutes breathing hardhell panting war was a young mans business and he wasnt a young man any more as he tried to catch his breath he wondered whether pushing the lizards back across a couple of miles of landscapeturnedtrashdump was worth the blood it would cost hed wondered the same thing over there once you were in em the stretches of shellpocked german trenches youd taken didnt seem as if they could possibly make up for the guys who got shot while you were taking them but you kept doing it over and over and over and eventually theboches couldnt stand the hammering any more and gave up mutt had figured it was what mr wilson called it the war to end war but then up popped hitler and up popped the japs and you had to go off and do it all over again and then along came the lizards and all of a sudden you werent fighting in some godforsaken place nobodyd ever heard of you were fighting in chicago for gods sake hell comiskey park or whatever was left of it couldnt have been more than a mile away freighttrain noises overhead said the lizards were going after the mortar crews mutt didnt wish those crews any harm but he was just as glad to have the aliens artillery pounding at something in back of the line on his belly he scrambled toward the hulk of a dead modela ford that sat on four flat tires smallarms fire was picking up the lizards didnt feel like leaving the neighborhood he was almost to the car when he got shot hed gone through months in france and more than a year in illinois without a scratch he hadnt thought he was invulnerable he knew better than that but he hadnt thought his number was up either at first he felt just the impact as if somebody had kicked him in the rear hard ahh shit he said as if an umpire had blown a close call at third base and wouldnt change it back no matter how obviously wrong he was he twisted around trying to see the wound given where hed been hit it wasnt easy but the seat of his pants was filling up with blood jesus god he muttered everybody goes and talks about gettin their ass shot off but i went and did it then the wound started to hurt as if he had a redhot skewer stuck into his hindquarters medic he bawled he knew he sounded like a branded calf but he couldnt help it dracula szabo slithered over to him when he saw where mutt was hit he started laughing sorry lieutenant he said after a moment and even halfway sounded as if he meant it i was just thinkin ill be damned if im gonna kiss it and make it better i ask for a medic an i go an get w c fields mutt said you got a field dressing on you at szabos nod he went on stick it on there will you sure thing lift up a little so i can get your pants down and get at where youre hit when mutt obeyed dracula bandaged him with cool competence that spoke of the practice hed had at such things his appraisal also told of that experience doesnt look too bad sir not quite a crease but its a throughandthrough and its just in the ham not in the bone you sit tight an wait for the medics to take you outta here youre gonna be okay i think sit tight mutt rolled his eyes i aint goin anyplace real fast not with that but i dont wanna sit on it neither yeah well i can see that dracula answered he swatted mutt lightly on the shoulder you take care good luck to you then he was gone back to the fight in the space of a moment daniels had gone from platoon leaderessentially gods righthand manto part of the detritus of war he sang out again medic that ran the risk of drawing lizards to him but he was willing to take the chance the lizards were pretty decent about not butchering wounded men probably better than either the germans or the americans had been in the last war where you hit soldier the man with the red cross armband was black at that moment mutt wouldnt have cared if hed been green right in the butt he answered okay the black man had a partner who was white mutt noticed that but didnt say anything about it even when the negro kept on being the spokesman well get the stretcher over by you and you slide onto it on your belly right right mutt did as he was told got me what the limeys used to call a blighty wound too bad to go on fightin but not bad enough to wreck me for good theyd get shipped back to england and they were done with the war me he shook his head the negro chuckled sympathetically afraid youre right about that lieutenant theyll fix you up and send you out again he turned to the white stretcher bearer come on jimmy lets get him back to the aid station right doc jimmy picked up his end of the stretcher doc mutt said hed wondered why the colored guy had done all the talking you a doctor he asked hed learned not to tack boy onto that thats right the negro didnt look back at daniels for the first time his voice got tight does it bother you alabama if im not lilywhite enough to take care of you i can leave you right here he sounded deadly serious im from mississippi mutt said automatically then he thought about the rest of the question i been out of mississippi a while too if youre american enough to want to patch my ass i reckon im american enough to say thankyou when youre done he waited hed run into a few educated black men who were just as good at hating as any kukluxer doc didnt say anything for a couple of steps then he nodded okay mississippi that sounds fair it damn well betterdaniels thoughtyoure not gonna get anything more out of me but he didnt say so out loud the colored doctor was doing his job and seemed willing to meet him halfway given mutts own present circumstances that was about as much as he had any right to expect the aid station had a big red cross flag flying in front of it and several more on the roof it was a big foursquare brick building not far from lake michigan doc said hey mississippi you know what this place was before the war no but that dont matter on account of i got the feeling youre just about to tell me mutt answered youre right the negro said you dont let much bother you do you this wasstill is i guessthe abraham lincoln center just another damnyankee daniels said so deadpan that the colored doctor gave him a sharp look over his shoulder before chuckling ruefully mutt went on doc ive done two turns of soldiering now and in between em i was a bushleague manager for about a hundred years so a smartmouth even a smartmouth doc that dont bother me much no gettin shot in the ass nowthat bothers me i can see how that would mess up a mans day jimmy the other stretcher bearer put in some dogfaces trudged past mutt on their way up to the front about half of them were grimy veterans like him the rest freshfaced kids some of the kids looked at the bloodstained bandage on his backside and gulped that didnt bother mutt hed done the same thing the first time he saw wounded in france war wasnt pretty and you couldnt make it pretty what did bother him was that about one rifletoting trooper in four was black the army was segregated like any decent and proper outfit seeing white and colored soldiers together in the same outfit bothered mutt as much as having white and colored ballplayers on the same team would have doc didnt look back but he didnt have to be a mindreader to figure out what daniels was thinking either he said when youre fightin to stay free sometimes you get freer mutt just grunted doc and jimmy lugged him into the aid station his nose wrinkled at the stink of wounds gone bad how messed up is this one somebody called from farther in not too doc answered needs a tetanus shot if we have any antitoxin and some stitching should be okay though yeah theres antitoxin the somebodya worn harassed somebody by his voicesaid its slow right now so why dont you sew him up quick before they bring in half a dozen bad ones all at the same time right doc and jimmy set mutt down where he wouldnt be in the way of other stretcher parties carrying in the wounded doc came back with a syringe a glass jar partly filled with a clear oily liquid and a clean rag he jabbed mutt in the backside with the needle ow mutt said why didnt you give me the ether first mississippi if you can grouse about a needle after you took a bullet in the cheek i think youre probably going to live the colored doctor told him he opened the jar soaked the rag and held it to daniels face the stink of the ether made mutt cough and choke he tried to pull away but the doctors hand at the back of his head wouldnt let him his vision got frayed and fuzzy and faded out like a movie when he woke up his mouth was dry as a salt mine and tasted like a latrine he hardly noticed he had a headache worse than any hed ever got from moonshine and that was saying something his backside felt as if an alligator had taken a good bite out of it too doc mutts voice was a hoarse croak the doctors are busy an orderly said can i get you some water oh lord i wish you would mutt answered the orderly sounded like some kind of pansy but if hed bring some water mutt didnt care what he did in his spare time he shook his head which made it hurt worse a nigger doctor and a pansy orderly colored troops fighting side by side with white men what the hell was the world coming to the orderly brought not only water but a couple of little white pills withbayer on them i found some aspirin he said it may do your head a little good you probably dont feel real well right now buddy you aint kidding mutt answered his hand trembled when he held it out for the aspirin tablets he grimaced in selfreproach youd think i had the dts or somethin youre still woozy from the anesthetic the orderly said that happens to everybody not he shut up and held out the water to daniels not just to old geezers like you mutt could fill in the blanks for himself he didnt care what with his head and his ventilated backside he felt as elderly as he probably looked he popped the aspirins into his mouth and washed them down with some water it probably came straight out of lake michigan chicago didnt have running water or even guaranteed clean water any more but you had to go on drinking even if you did get the runs now and again thank you friend he said with a sigh that was mighty kind of you even if i do wish it was a bottle of beer instead oh so do i the orderly exclaimed which made mutt blink when he thought about queerswhich he didnt spend a lot of time doinghe pictured them sipping wine not knocking back a beer the fellow studied mutts bandages which made him shift nervously from side to side just because he had to lie on his stomach didnt mean then the orderly said youre probably one of the few people whos gladfor a while anyhowthe toilets dont work with that wound squatting over a bucket will hurt you a lot less than sitting down would thats true daniels said hadnt much thought about it yet but youre right he was beginning to feel a little more like himself maybe the aspirin was starting to work or maybe the ether cobwebs were going away you have trouble or need help you just sing out for me the orderly said my name is archie dont be shy i dont mindits why im here i bet you dont mindbut mutt kept his mouth shut again like the colored doctor this guy was doing his job he was entitled to enjoy itif he didso long as he didnt make a nuisance of himself mutt sighed the world got crazier day by day though he wished it hadnt got crazy enough to shoot him in the ass thanks archie if i have to take you upon that i will sweat ran down george bagnalls face when summer finally got to pskov it didnt fool about the grass on the hills outside of town was turning yellow as the sun the forests of pine and fir to the east and south though remained as dark and gloomy in summer as at any other time of year a lot of german troops in pskov went around barechested to get a suntan the russians didnt go in for that the ones who werent in uniform and were lucky enough to have a change of clothes switched to lighter baggier tunics and trousers bagnalls raf uniform wasnt much more than tatters these days he mostly wore russian civilian clothes with a red army officers cap to give him a semblance of authority as happened on account of that somebody came up to him and asked him something in russian he got the gistwhich way to the new stables and answered in his own halting russian ah the fellow saidnemets nyetbagnall answered firmlyanglichani you never could be sure how a russian would react if he thought you were a jerrybetter to set him right straightaway ahanglichani khorosho the russian said englishmangood he rattled off something bagnall thought was thanks for the directions and hurried off toward the street to which bagnall had pointed bagnall headed on toward the market square as a fighting man he got plenty of black bread the cabbage soup calledshchi and borscht along with the occasional bit of hen or mutton or pork the russians ate and thrived the germans ate and didnt complainthe winter before the lizards came theyd been eating horses that froze to death in the snow bagnall wanted something better or at least different he wanted to see if any of thebabushkas would part with some eggs the old and middleaged women sat in rows behind rickety tables or blankets on which theyd laid out what they had for sale with their solid blocky figures and the outlines of their heads smoothed and rounded by the scarves they all wore they reminded bagnall of nothing so much as figures from those cleverly carved multilayered sets of russian wooden dolls the immobile stolidity with which they sat only enhanced the illusion no one was displaying any eggs but that didnt necessarily signify hed found out good stuff often got held back either for some special customer or just to keep it from being pilfered he walked up to one of thebabushkas and saiddobry den the woman stared at him expressionlessyaichnitsa she didnt bother returning his goodday she didnt even bother scowling at him she just looked through him as if he didnt exist it was one of the most effortlessly annihilating glances hed ever received he felt himself wilting as she let him know she didnt have any eggs and that even if she had had some eggs she wouldnt have had any for a german before the lizards came before the partisans emerged from the forest to reclaim a share of pskov she never would have dared to act so to a german either if shed had eggs she would either have turned them over or hidden them so well the nazis would never had suspected they were there as it was he got the notion she was just taunting him nyet nemetshe said as he had beforeanglichani anglichanishe gave forth with a spate of russian much too quick for him to follow in detail what he did get though suggested that that made a difference she plucked a few sorrylooking potatoes out of a bowlyoud have to have been starving to want them underneath lay more equally unprepossessing spudsand nestled among them several eggs skolkohe asked how much she wanted rubles apiece or marks german money had been falling against its soviet equivalent ever since bagnall arrived in pskov the soviet union and germany were still going concerns but the lizards in poland and to the south of pskov screened the city away from much contact with other german forces the soviet presence on the other hand was growing that might lead to trouble one day as if the reds and the nazis didnt already have enough trouble getting along bozhemoibagnall shouted loud enough to draw glances frombabushkas several places away hed learned youd best forget all youd ever known of british reserve if you wanted to get anywhere dickering with russians if you stayed polite they thought you were weak and they rode roughshod over you he knew he mixed his cases and numbers in a way that would have got him a caning in sixthform latin but he didnt care this wasnt school this was the real world however inelegant his russian might have been it worked and he didnt think thebabushka was any budding pushkin either he ended up buying three eggs for seven hundred rubles which wasnt half bad nyet anglichanithebabushka said pointing at himzhid bagnall remembered an old beautifully dressed jewish man hed seen walking slowly along a paris street with a sixpointed yellow star with the wordjuif on it sewn to his jacket pocket the expression of dignified misery that man had worn would go with him to his grave but the sneer in thebabushkas voice told him something of how others had thought it a good idea to make the old jew wear a yellow star zhidbagnall said quietlyspasebo thank you thebabushkas gray eyes went blank and empty as a couple of stones bagnall took the eggs and headed for the house he shared with ken embry and jerome jones he hoped he wouldnt run into tatiana the sniper a buzz in the sky made him turn as he walked past a grassy park on whose greensward sheep grazed under the watchful eyes of red army andwehrmacht guards after a moment he spotted an approaching plane not a lizard fighter lean and graceful as a shark and a millionfold more deadly but a humanbuilt machine that hardly looked as if it belonged in the same sky as lizard aircraft or even those of the raf it was nonetheless the first humanbuilt airplaneand not coincidentally the first plane not loaded with ordnance intended to punch his tickethed seen in a long time that alone sent his spirits soaring the red army guards raised a cheer when they spied the red stars painted on the wings and fuselage and tailplane the russian aircraft was coming into pskov at treetop height at first bagnall thought that was just because it skimmed the ground to give the lizards a harder time spotting it then as it lowered its flaps he realized the pilot intended to bring it down right in the park hes out of his bloody mind bagnall muttered but the pilot wasnt the biplane wasnt going very fast and wasnt very heavy it rolled to a stop with better than a hundred yards of meadow to spare it even managed to avoid running over a sheep or butchering one with its prop as it taxied bagnall trotted toward it with the vague notion of congratulating whoever had done the flying first out of the aircraft was a tall skinny fellow with a thick red beard he wore a fieldgray tunic but bagnall would have guessed him for a german even without ithis face was too long and beaky to belong to most russians sure enough he started yelling in german come on you dumbheads lets get this stinking airplane under cover before the lizards spot it and blow it to hell and gone the pilot stood up and shouted support for the nazi bagnall didnt follow all of it but he knewmaskirovka meant camouflage that wasnt what made him stop and stare though hed heard the reds used female pilots but he hadnt more than half believed it till now yet there she was she took off her leather flying helmet and hair the color of ripe wheat spilled down almost to her shoulders her face was wide and rather flat her skin fair but tanned except around the eyes where her goggles shielded it from the sun the eyes themselves were intensely blue she saw him and the officers cap he was wearing climbed down out of the biplane and walked up to him saluting she said comrade i am senior lieutenant ludmila gorbunova reporting to pskov as ordered with the german sergeant georg schultz a tank gunner and highly capable mechanic fumblingly bagnall explained he wasnt really a red army officer and who he really was without much hope he addedvuy gavoritye poangliski no i dont speak english she replied in russian but then she did switch languagessprechen sie deutsch ich kann deutsch ein wenig sprechen i speak a little german also perhaps more than a little now he answered in the same tongue hearing german georg schultz came up and greeted bagnall with a stiffarm salute and a loudheil hitler bugger hitlerwas the first thought that came to bagnalls mind if it hadnt been for the lizards he and schultzand for that matter schultz and ludmila gorbunovawould have been at each others throats the germans made even more uncomfortable allies than the russians senior lieutenant gorbunova looked pained he is a dedicated fascist as you hear but he has also done very good work for the red air force with tools in his hand he is a genius bagnall studied schultz he must be he said slowly if the nazi hadnt been bloody good the communists would have got rid of him on general principles that they hadnt was probably a measure of their own desperate situation men came running up to drag the biplane as far in among the trees over to one side of the park as its wings would permit others draped it with camouflage netting before long it had all but disappeared thatmay do ludmila said casting a critical eye its way she turned back to george bagnall i think i am glad to meet you you english here in pskov you are she ran out of german then tried a couple of russian words bagnall didnt understand finally he got the idea she meant something likearbitrators yes that is right bagnall answered in german when thewehrmacht commander and the partisan brigadiers cannot agree they bring their arguments for us to decide what if they dont like what you decide georg schultz asked why should they listen to a pack of damned englishmen he stared at bagnall with calculated insolence because they were killing each other here before they started listening to us bagnall answered schultz looked like one very rugged customer but bagnall took a step toward him anyhow if he wanted a scrap he could have one the flight engineer went on we do need to stick together against the lizards you know that is part of why the two of us were sent here ludmila gorbunova said we are german and russian but we have worked well with each other schultz leered at her bagnall wondered if she meant they were sleeping together he hoped not she wasnt as pretty as tatiana but on three minutes acquaintance she seemed much nicer then she noticed schultzs slobbering stare and answered it with one that would have made any longsuffering english barmaid proud it also made the world seem a much more cheerful place to george bagnall come with me he said ill take you to thekrom where both sides have their headquarters ludmila gorbunova smiled at him as she nodded he felt like bursting into song do you know what one of the troubles with big uglies is atvar said to his englishspeaking interpreter as they waited for the emissary from the united states to be shown into the conference chamber they have so many exalted fleetlord the interpreter answered which in particular are you thinking of today they areuntidy creatures atvar said with distaste their clothes flap about them like loose skins the tufts they grow on their heads either flap about too or else are held down with enough oil to lubricate a landcruiser engine and they spew water from their hides instead of panting as proper people should they are disgusting truth exalted fleetlord the interpreter said gravely pshing atvars adjutant came on one of the communications screens exalted fleetlord the tosevite from the united states is here i remind you his name is cordell hull his title is secretary of state before we came he was the chief aide in dealing with other big ugly empires for his notempires leader send him in atvar said cordell hull looked uncomfortable in weightlessness but made a good game show of pretending he wasnt even for a big ugly he was long though not especially wide the tuft of fuzz on top of his head was almost white atvar knew that meant he was aging so did the wrinkles and sags in his integument he was not attractive but then to atvars eyes no big ugly was after the polite greetings customary even between enemies atvar plunged straight in i demand from you the immediate return of the traitorous shiplord straha who fled to you in violation of all law cordell hull spoke a single sharp word no the translator indicated that that was a negative atvar had suspected as much hull went on at some length afterwards the united states does not give back people who come to us seeking shelter my land is made up of people who came seeking freedom we welcomed them we did not turn them away you welcomed criminals atvar said and then in an aside to the interpreter it does not surprise me a bit though you neednt tell him that we did hull answered defiantly many things that were called crimes were really nothing more than disagreeing with the leaders of the lands they left his eyes though sunk deep in his head like any tosevites bored into atvars with disconcerting keenness the fleetlord said do you not call stealing a shuttlecraft a crime straha is a robber as well as a traitor is your notempire also in the habit of keeping stolen goods we demand the shuttlecrafts return too go ahead and demand hull replied in war if one side is generous enough to help the other it doesnt get its toys back in war the side that is losing is usually wise enough to deal politely with the side that is winning atvar said so the ancient records of the race tell us at any rate the race has never lost a war against another species if you think were losing look at chicago hull said in his own way he was as exasperating an opponent as the sssrs molotov the latter big ugly was as inflexible as a poorly programmed machine mechanically rejecting everything atvar said hull instead tried to twist things atvar said look at chicago yourself our forces continue to advance through the city the large factories you defended for so long are now practically cleared of tosevites and soon our victorious males will reach the shore of the lake by which the city lies bully for them hull answered which caused the interpreter considerable confusion after the misunderstanding was straightened out the us secretary of state said some of your victorious males may make it to lake michigan but how many of em wont how many of em are dead and stinking in the streets of chicago far fewer than the males you throw away like wastepaper in a futile effort to halt us atvar snapped he didnt like being reminded of the casualties the conquest of chicago was costing the race cordell hulls face twisted into one of the leers the big uglies used to show emotion this is an expression of amusement and irony the interpreter told atvar in a brief aside he said we have more men to spend than you do and more of everything else too before long youre going to have to start robbing peter to pay paul if you want reinforcements the interpreter needed to go back and forth with hull a few times but when he finally made sense of that it made sense to atvar too worst of it was that the tosevite was right every time fresh males went into chicago an offensive somewhere else on tosev necessarily suffered either that or a garrison in a safely conquered region was reduced whereupon more often than not the region was found not to be so safely conquered after all trying to match hulls irony the fleetlord said what would you have us do then exalted tosevite who me im just a jumpedup tennessee lawyer hull replied which occasioned still more translation difficulties once they were resolved hull went on we dont hold with fancy titles in the united statesnever have never will we figure part of being free is getting away from all that nonsense atvar stared at him in honest bewilderment every society built by every intelligent race was hierarchicalhow could it be otherwise why pretend such a manifest and obvious truth did not exist he had no time to ponder that hull was still talking if you really want to know what i want you to do what the people of the united states want you to do what the people of the world want you to do its not what anybody would call complicated quit killing people and go back to your own planet the fleetlord tried to imagine his reception if he returned to home with a beaten army in cold sleep bearing word that the species that had defeated him was now seeking to develop space travel on its own and would in a short time as the race reckoned such things be heading out toward the empire it cannot be he answered quickly well i allow i reckoned youd say as much cordell hull told him next best would be for you to stay herewed set aside land somewhere for you maybeand make peace with us you tosevites are not in any position to grant us terms atvar said angrily we are in the process of conquering you of bringing you into the empire and we shall continue until victory is won in chicago and everywhere else if youre going to take that attitude why did you bring me up here to this spaceship in the first place hull asked flying up here was a big jolt for an old man like me you were summoned to hear our demand for the return of the traitor straha which you have insolently refused and to bring a warning back to your emperor atvar said we dont have an emperor or want one either hull said your leader thenwhatever you call him atvar hissed in exasperation the warning is simple if you seek to produce nuclear weapons you will be utterly destroyed hull studied him for a while before answering every so often despite their weird features the tosevites could look disconcertingly keen this was one of those times being divided up into tens or hundreds of ephemeral little squabbling empires each always trying to outdo or outcheat its neighbors had given them a political sophisticationor perhaps just a talent for chicanerythe race despite its long history had trouble matching slowly hull said you intend to conquer us whether we make these weapons or not why should we give up the best chance not just to hurt you but to beat you whats the percentage in it for us we shall conquer you with or without your nuclear weapons atvar answered more of your notempire more of your people will survive if you do not force us to extremes cordell hull made a strange noise half gasping half barking this is what the big uglies use for laughter the interpreter said yes i know that atvar answered impatiently what did i say that was so amusing when the us secretary of state spoke again he made a grim kind of sense why should we care in your scheme of things were all going to be your slaves forever anyhow to keep that from happening well do anythinganythingi tell you men are meant to live free when you came here we were fighting among ourselves to make that happen well fight you too now atvar was the one who hesitated the big uglies constantly prated of freedom the best analysts of the race kept trying to understand and kept having trouble atvar didnt find the concept attractive what the tosevites meant by it seemed to him nothing more than anarchy do you not care what happens to the males and females under your rule he asked to any civilized male the race came first any individuals fate paled in importance beside the welfare of the group if the tosevites thought like that they did a good job of hiding it cordell hull said if the united states isnt free if her people arent free theres no point to the whole business time you figured that out you get your soldiers and your bases out of our country maybe we have something to talk about until then forget it molotov had made the same demand although hed couched it in terms ofwhat had he called it the ineluctable historical dialectic a notion that gave analysts even more trouble than did the mysterious and quite possibly unreal thing called freedom the big uglies had a gift for dreaming up concepts unsupported by evidence atvar said if you cannot make us do something you are in a poor position to tell us we must do it as a price for beginning talks the same applies to you hull retorted you cant make us quit trying to beat you by any way that comes to hand so youd just as well give up on that maybe after weve battered you some more youll be more willing to talk sense the fleetlords breath hissed out in a long sigh you will regret your obstinacy he turned to one of the males who had brought hull to the conference chamber we are finished here take him back to the shuttle let him convey to his emperorhis notemperor i should saythe substance of our discussion when the tosevite was gone atvar sighed again they refuse to see reason the more readily they yield and accept the emperors supremacy the higher their place within the empire will be if we cannot trust them if they are always rising in futile revolt before he could finish the thought pshings face appeared on the screen once more exalted fleetlord urgent new reports from britain by his adjutants tone the new reports werent good ones urgent news from the surface of tosev was seldom good give them to me atvar said it shall be done as threatened the british have turned loose their new weapon or weapons against us chemicalsof what sort we are still investigatingare being delivered by artillery and aerosol to poison our males casualties have occurred as a result of this these poisonous gases have also adversely affected morale when the big uglies employ them they are sometimes able to achieve local successes in their wake commanders in britain urgently request countermeasures atvar stared at pshing who looked back at him as if expecting him to produce countermeasures from a pouch on his belt refer all this to our scientific teams with a highest priority tag the fleetlord answered then he asked are the tosevites indiscriminately poisoning their own fighting males in an effort to harm us one of pshings eye turrets swiveled down toward his desktop to study a report there exalted fleetlord this does not appear to be the case they wear masks which give them at least some protection against their own chemical agents some of these have been captured we are endeavoring to modify them to serve our own needs and doing the same with our antiradiation masks unfortunately we have very limited quantities of the latter good that you thought of it though atvar said for a moment there hed wondered if he was the only male in the entire race left with a working brain then he realized that now instead of worrying about whether the big uglies were able to match the technical developments of the race he was worrying about whether the race could duplicate something the big uglies had invented it was a very unpleasant way to come full circle when the lizards first came to earth moishe russie had been starving in the warsaw ghetto praying for a sign from god that he would not abandon his people russie had taken the nuclear bomb theyd exploded high above central europe as a sign his prayer was being answered though hed learned later that the lizards had hoped to use the blast to scramble communications and disrupt electronics generally for reasons he didnt altogether understand it hadnt worked out as theyd expected that wasnt the point though when the light in the sky answered his prayer people in the ghetto had started calling himreb moishe and some of them had even looked on him as a prophet he hadnt believed that himself not really but sometimes you wondered now crouched down in a rubblestrewn st albans street between a theater left over from the days of ancient rome and the even more battered ruins of what had been some wealthy nobles mansion a couple of hundred years before he wondered again as hed predicted to nathan jacobi here he was in british service wearing a red cross armband i didnt think about the gas mask though he said the mask distorted his voice and made him sound like something from another planet although not thank god a lizard with its long snout and the tube running down to the chemical canister that purified the air the mask made him look inhuman too rather like a kangaroo with an elephants trunk not only did it change the way he looked it changed the way he saw peering out at the world through a pair of portholes that got dirty whenever they felt like it and stayed more or less permanently steamed up made him appreciate what a marvel normal vision was somewhere north of st albans the lizards were licking their wounds theyd been in the city itself till a barrage of mustard gas and phosgene followed by a desperate infantry attack drove them out again now st albans was in british hands once more moishe wondered when the lizards would start using poison gas of their own it probably wouldnt be long he also wondered if anyone on either side would be alive when the war was over down in the roman theater someone called out help in a drowned choking voice the cry wasnt yiddish or polish moishe had to translate it into a language he habitually used then he realized it wasnt english either that was a hurt lizard down there he hesitated no more than a heartbeat before he scrambled down into the remains of the theater he wondered for a moment what sort of plays the ancient inhabitants of st albans which surely hadnt been the roman name for the place had watched there the theater was shaped like a capital c with a colonnadeone column still miraculously standingbehind the rectangular stage that occupied what would have been the open space keeping the c from becoming an o curved banks of earth formed the letter itself and showed where the seats had been the lizard lay in the flat open area in the center of the theater would that have been called the orchestra moishe knew only slightly more of the classical theater than he did of the fine points of chinese calligraphy that also held true he realized for what he knew about how to treat injured lizardsnot that any human being was likely to be expert in that field ill do what i can he muttered inside the mask hed dealt with the lizards long enough in warsaw to come to see them as people too and lizard prisoners were valuable he hadnt had much in the way of a briefing before they sent him out to do his best for king and country not his king or his country but that was irrelevant now but theyd made that crystal clear then he got a clearer look through his dirty steamy windows on the world and realized this lizard wasnt going to live long enough to be worth anything as a captive its body was covered with blisters some of them bigger than moishes fist the blisters destroyed the patterns of its body paint they seemed to cluster under its arms and at the join of its legs although it also had one that swallowed up an eye turret from the bubbling way it breathed russie was sure the mustard gas was wrecking its lungs as well the lizard could still see out of the eye the gas had not destroyed help me it gasped not caring in the least that he was a despised tosevite hurts it added the emphatic cough then kept on coughing and couldnt stop bloody bubbles came out of its mouth and nostrils help how russie asked with an interrogative cough not know seeing what the gas had done left him sick to his stomach although being sick inside a gas mask was anything but a good idea i dont know how the lizard answered more fluent now that russie had spoken to it in its own language you big uglies made this horrible stuff you must have the antidote for it no antidote moishe answered there was an ointment that was supposed to do some good on mustard gas burns and blisters but he had none and in any case word was the stuff didnt really help then kill me the lizard said kill me i beg another emphatic cough turned into another paroxysm that tore the lizard to pieces from the inside out moishe stared at it in dismay everything hed learned in medical school everything trained into him as a jew made him want to cry no and to flee from the abominable act hed been asked to perform one of the things they had warned him about in medical school was that you didnt learn everything you needed to become a doctor there hed seen that in warsaw from on now he saw it again even more starkly i beg the lizard said he looked around the lizard must not have been gassed here for he didnt see its rifle he had no weapons himself medical personnel were supposed to be noncombatants what was he supposed to do bash in its head with a rock he didnt think he could no matter how much the lizard wanted himneededhimto do just that while he stood there in his own mental torment yet another coughing fit wracked the lizard the coughs subsided to gasps the gasps stopped oh thank god moishe exclaimed sometimes even death could be a blessingand he hadnt had to inflict it since lizards didnt wear clothes they carried what they needed in a pack on their back and in belt pouches russie peeled off the pack and undid the pouches then because sitting out in the middle of the orchestra made him feel naked and exposed to artillery and whatever live lizards might still be in the neighborhood he took the chattels first up onto the stage where he could shelter behind the one intact column and the stubs of the others and then down into a shell hole behind it he didnt think he could find better cover than that he opened the pack first in it were several full magazines for the automatic rifles the lizards used those would be useful a few englishmen carried captured lizard weapons and they were always crying for ammunition he also found half a dozen little bricks of what the lizards reckoned field rations each one wrapped in stuff that reminded him of cellophane but was thicker more pliable and less shiny lizard prisoners were welcome to the rations which struck him as distinctly unappetizing he wondered more about their wrapping what it was and how they made it it wasnt really like anything mankind turned out something else spilled out of the pack a case about the size of a ration brick better and better moishe said to no one in particular the case was a wireless set though how the lizards managed to build such a tiny wireless was beyond himand beyond the best human scientists and engineers in the world too in the same way that the ration wrappers reminded him of cellophane the material from which the case was made put him in mind of bakelite but it wasnt bakelite it was another one of the types of stuff the lizards could manufacture and people couldnt along with such practical things as food ammunition and communications gear the lizard also carried in its pack a whole sheaf of papers more than russie would have expected to find on any ten human casualties one of the papers was a map moishe recognized the street grid of st albans down in one corner the map had notations in the squiggly lizard script moishe did his best to puzzle them out back in warsaw hed learned the characters the lizards used for their written language it hadnt taken him long he already dealt with two versions of one alphabet for yiddish and hebrew and two versions of another for polish and german the trouble was that while he could read the words he mostly didnt know what they meant he hadnt had time to build up anything but the most basic vocabulary too bad he said and tucked the papers into his medical bag somebody would understand what they meant one thing that had impressed him about the english was the amount of scholarly talent they could bring to bear on almost anything he fumbled at one of the belt pouches before he finally got it open the closure would have been much easier to work if hed had claws on his fingertips rather than nails a card a little bigger than a standard business card spilled out onto the ground when he picked it up and turned it over he found himself staring into one of the lizards threedimensional pictures it showed the male who had just died in the roman theater letter by letter he sounded out the lizards name ekretkan he wondered what sort of person ekretkan had been how hed lived before he came to earth what hed thought of the races war before he became one of its victims the card offered no clue to that next to ekretkans photo was a complicated network of golds and greens that reminded russie of the body paint pattern the lizard had worn he supposed it showed the dead males rank seniority and specialization but had no idea how to read it the card went into his bag with the papers moishe went through the rest of the pouches looking for more clues to ekretkan the individual as opposed to ekretkan the soldier even nazis had parents wives children dogs and often carried pictures of them not ekretkan he had a couple of pictures moishe thought were of himself one with him astride a contraption that looked like a fourwheeled motorcycle another with him wearing a somewhat simpler version of the body paint in which hed died ekretkan also had a couple of photos of a flat empty of other lizards but filled with gadgets that did things incomprehensible to russiehome sweet home he thought and the lizard carried a photo of a street scene that looked like the new york moishe had seen in the cinema only more so tall thrusting buildings of steel and glass streets crowded with vehicles sidewalks full of lizards who looked as if they were in a hurryhis home town russie wondered he set the meager handful of photographs on the ground in a row and stared at them trying to draw meaning from them if ekretkan was a typical male what did that say about how the race lived could a males life be as barren as the pictures made it look most of the males moishe had known in warsaw had seemed happy enough and no crazier than human beings filling similar social roles and so he muttered the race had mating seasons not families hed learned that back in warsaw too the lizards thought human mating customs just as strange and revolting as most humans found theirs russie examined the pictures again searching for clues like a talmudic scholar contemplating a difficult text the most important difference he saw between lizards and people was that lizards didnt have families that meantwhat that they were alone a lot especially when they werent working they probably liked it that way too ekretkans pictures showed either himself or his empty flat which argued in favor of moishes line of reasoning what about the street scene then moishe picked that one up set it aside from the others and thought about families some more no lizard families that didnt mean lonely lizards even if the lizards were often alone but it did mean the family wouldnt get in the way of whatever loyalty the lizards gave to any entity bigger than the individual he nodded pleased with himself that fit he didnt know whether it was true but it fit all the loyalty each lizard didnt reserve for himself went straight to the race moishe had seen that the race and the emperor were as important to each male if in a less vicious way as thevolk and thefuhrer were to a nazi moishe gathered up the pictures and put them in his black bag along with the rest of the luckless ekretkans effects he got out of the shell hole and headed back toward regimental headquarters other people needed to evaluate what hed found he wondered how his conclusions would stack up against those of a real lizard expert you know sergeant ben berkowitz said clasping his hand behind his head and leaning back in his chair the lizards are plenty to drive a psychiatristmeshuggeh i ought to know i am one he paused you know whatmeshuggeh means no offense but you dont sound like youre from new york sam yeager chuckled i better notim from nebraska but yeahuh yes siri know what it means something like crazy right ive played ball with a few jewish guys its one of the things theyd say but why do the lizards drive you nuts except because theyre lizards i mean how much do you know about psychiatry berkowitz asked not much yeager admittedastounding had run some great articles about the physical sciences and even about weird things like linguistics for time travelers but zilch about psychiatry okay berkowitz said equably one of the basic principles of freudian analysis is that a big part of why people do what they do comes from their sex drive and the conflicts that revolve around it no offense sir but it doesnt seem to me like you have to be a psychiatrist to figure that one out yeager chuckled in fond reminiscence i think about some of the crazy things i used to do to get myself laid yeah me too except im still doing em berkowitzs hand was bare of wedding ring that didnt have to signify not with a man but evidently it did but like you say if it was that simple anybody could see it its not freud relates sex to all sorts of things that dont look like they have anything to do with it at first glance the competitive drive the urge to create the way you relate to people the same sex as you he hastily held up that ringless hand dont get me wrongi dont mean you in particular and im not calling you queer its okay captain i worked that out sam said even if he was a shrink ben berkowitz was a regular guy too yeager hadnt got to the point of realizing it might be important for a psychiatrist to be able to make like a regular guy to help him do the rest of his job better you with me so far berkowitz asked i guess so yeager said cautiously i never really thought about sex tying in to all that other stuff but maybe it does youll go with it for the sake of argument you mean i guess so sam repeated berkowitz laughed at him he was engagingly ugly when he grinned he looked about eighteen like one of the brightor sometimes smartasskids who filled the letter column inastounding he said careful son of a gun arent you remind me not to play poker with you well for the sake of argument lets say we can get all sorts of useful insights into the way the human mind works when we use freudian analysis it would be nice if we could do the same thing with the lizards so why cant you yeager asked then a lightbulb went on in his head oh theyve got a waddayacallita mating season right the first time ben berkowitz grinned again you may look like a farm boy yeager but youre pretty damn sharp you know that thank you sir sam didnt think of himself as pretty damn sharp barbara for instance could run rings around him but she didnt seem bored with him either so maybe he wasnt quite the nearhick hed often felt hanging around with fasttalking bigcity ballplayers thank you sir just like some of those fasttalking city guys berkowitz had a flare for mimicry unlike a lot of them he didnt spike it with malice he said believe me sergeant if you were a dimbulb you wouldnt be in hot springs this and the project you came from are probably the two most important places in the united statesand youve had your hand in both of them damn few people can say as much i never thought of it like that yeager said when he did he saw he had something to be proud of well you should have berkowitz told him but back to business okay like you said the lizards have a mating season when their females smell right they screw themselves silly when they dont he snapped his fingers everything shuts off just like that its like theyre sexually neutral beings ninety percent of the timeall the time if no lady lizards are around they think what we do is funny as hell yeager said dont they just berkowitz agreed straha tells me they have a whole big research program going just trying to figure out what makes us tick and they havent come close yet were in the same boat with them except were just starting out and theyve been doing it ever since they got here thats cause theyre winning the war sam said when youre ahead you can afford to monkey around with stuff that isnt really connected to the fighting when youre losing like we are you have enough other problems closer to home so you cant worry about stuff out on the edge aint it the truth berkowitz said the colloquialism dropped from his lips without sounding puton though sam was sure he knew his whos and whoms as well as barbara did not sounding puton was also part of his job he went on so how do we figure out what makes a lizard tick way down deep inside it isnt sex and that makes them different from us at a level we have trouble even thinking about ristin and ullhass say the other two kinds of bugeyed monsters the lizards have conquered work the same way they do yeager said the hallessi and the rabotevs yes ive heard that too berkowitz leaned back in his chair sweat darkened the khaki of his uniform shirt under the arms sam felt his own shirt sticking to him all down the back and he wasnt doing anything but sitting still if say you wanted to go out and play ball he recalled wringing out his flannels after games down here you thought you remembered what this kind of weather was like but when you found yourself stuck in it week in and week out you learned your memorymaybe mercifullyhad blocked the worst of it he ran the back of his hand across his forehead since one was about as wet as the other that didnt help much hot he said inadequately sure is berkowitz said i wonder about the rabotevs and the hallessi i really do i wish we could do something for them the lizards have held them down for thousands of years from what ive heard theyre supposed to be as loyal to the emperor as the lizards are themselves yeager answered theyre honorary lizards pretty much i guess thats what the lizards had in mind for us too i think youre right berkowitz said nodding you want to hear something funny something i got out of straha he waited for sam to nod back then went on about eight hundred years ago the lizards sent some kind of a probe to earth it beamed a whole bunch of pictures and i dont know what else back to the planet the lizards call home and they figured wed be a piece of cake because we couldnt possibly have changed much in that short a time sam thought that one over for a few seconds then his eye caught berkowitzs they both started to laugh yeager said you mean they thought theyd be fighting king arthur and richard the lionhearted and and he gave up those were the only two medieval names he could come up with thats just what they thought berkowitz agreed they expected to run tanks and fighter planes up against knights on horseback the conquest would have taken maybe twenty minutes and the only way a lizard would have gotten hurt was if he fell down and stubbed his toe we gave em a little surprise didnt we sam said a lots happened sincehe paused to subtract in his head or so uhhuh good thing for us it has too but you know heres the strange part if theyd sent the probe in and come in things wouldnt have changed that muchtheyd still have had a walkover or if theyd sent it innow berkowitz paused for subtraction bc and come in ad it would have been the same story so they might have been right when they figured things wouldnt change much and they could take their own sweet time getting ready to squash us flat i hadnt thought about it like that yeager admitted he didnt care to think about it like that either something else occurred to him they sure came loaded for bear if they expected to be taking on knights in shining armor didnt they just berkowitz ruefully shook his head i asked straha about that he kind of reared back the way they do when they think youre being stupid you know what i mean then he said you do not go to a war without enough tools to win it this is what we thought we had he may still be right sam said so he may berkowitz looked at his watch and ive got to run and interview a lizard tank officer about armorpiercing shells i enjoy chewing the fat with you sergeantyouve got the right kind of mind to deal with the lizards people who start out too sure of themselves end up you should pardon the expression nuts laughing yeager went up to the fourth floor he found ullhass and ristin in a state of high excitement look exalted sergeant sam ristin said holding up a set of what looked like bottles of nail polish the grand and magnificent shiplord straha brought with him a great store of body paints he will share them with us now we no longer need be naked thats nice sam agreed equably does each of you paint himself or do you paint each other we paint each other ullhass let out a mournful hissing sigh but we really should not paint our old rank patterns on our bodies we hold those ranks no longer we are only prisoners then paint yourselves to show that yeager said there are markings to show one is a prisoner ristin said but a prisoner who has done something wrong and is being punished we did nothing wrong you big uglies captured us and made us prisoners we have no markings for that probably didnt think it would ever happen when you set out from homeyeager thought he said if you dont have those markings why not invent some ristin and ullhass looked at each other obviously that idea hadnt occurred to them and wouldnt have either such markings would not be official ullhass said as if that doomed the notion in and of itself but sam said sure they would theyd be official us lizard pow at hot springs marks if youre our prisoners you should use our marks right the two lizards looked at each other again they took suggestions from superior authority very seriously indeed what are these us lizard pow at hot springs marks ristin asked yeager was about to tell him to make up his own when he had a better ideamuch more than most people lizards liked doing as they were told he said you should paint yourselves with red and white stripes and blue stars that way youll look like youre wearing american flags ristin and ullhass talked back and forth in their own language sam was getting fluent enough now to follow them pretty well he hid a smile as he listened to their enthusiasm grow before long ristin said it shall be done when they were through yeager thought they looked gaudy as all get out but nobodyd hired him for base art critic so he kept his big mouth shut ullhass and ristin were delighted which was the point of the exercise in the next few days several other formerly paintless lizards started sporting stars and stripes sams highly unofficial suggestion looked as if it might turn official after all then one day as sam was coming out of the room he shared with barbara a peremptory hiss stopped him in his tracks you are the tosevite who devised thesethese unpleasant prisoner color combinations straha demanded thats right shiplord sam answered is something wrong with them yes something is wrong straha used an emphatic cough to show how wrong the something was past that he looked angry enough to be twitching he reminded yeager of nothing so much as a tentshow revival preacher testifying against the evils of demon rum and loose women this you have done with the paint this is wrong this is a mark the race does not use it must be cleansed at once from the scales of the males it is an yeager hadnt heard the next word before but if it didnt mean something likeabomination hed eat his hat why is that shiplord he asked as innocently as he could because it destroys all order and discipline straha replied as if to an idiot child body paint shows rank and assignment and seniority it is not to be used for frivolous purposes of decoration shiplord it does show assignment it shows that the males who wear it are prisoners of the united states sam said if you want it to show seniority too the males who have been prisoners longer can wear more stars than the others would that be all right he tried to sound quiet and reasonable all the same he expected straha to blow up like a pressure cooker with its safety valve stuck but the shiplord surprised him the trouble with dealing with tosevites is that one forgets how perspective shifts do you understand this i dont think i do shiplord sam answered im sorry straha made an exasperated noise rather like a water heater with a slow leak i explain further then with the race all is as it has been we do not casually invent body paint designs they all fit into a system we have been refining for more than a hundred thousand years yeager knew enough to divide that by two to convert it into earthly years but it was still a hell of a long time straha went on you big uglies though you just casually invent you care nothing for largescale system all that matters to you is shortterm results were at war shiplord we were at war before the race got here yeager said whatever it takes to win well do we change all the time this we have noticed to our sorrow straha said the weapons with which you fight us now are better than the ones you used when we first came ours are still the same this is what i meant about looking at you from a different perspective if something suits you for the moment you will seize upon it not caring a bit how it accords with what you formerly did you invent a bodypaint pattern on the spur of the moment the shiplord hissed again i suppose i should be used to that sort of thing but every now and again it still shocks me this was one of those times yeager thought of all the pulp sciencefiction stories hed read where an inventor had an idea one day built it the next and massproduced it the day after that generally just in time to save the world from the martians hed always taken those with a grain of salt about the size of the great salt flats outside salt lake city real life didnt work that way to the lizards though earth must have seemed the embodiment of pulp science fiction run amok in not a whole lot more than a year human beings had rolled out longrange rockets bazookas and jet planes to say nothing of the atomic bomb that didnt count improvements to already existing items like tanks either and by all accounts poison gas which dated back to world war i was new and nasty to the lizards so youll forgive the other prisoners here for using americanstyle body paint then sam asked i am not a prisoner i am a refugee straha said with dignity but yes i forgive it i was hasty when i condemned it out of hand but haste for the race is to be actively discouraged the captive males may wear any sort of marking tosevite authorities suggest thank you shiplord yeager said as lizards went straha seemed like a pretty adaptable guy if you actively discouraged haste though you didnt make life any easier for yourself not on earth you didnt teerts sometimes felt guilty about what happened to tokyo millions of intelligent beings dead and all because hed warned of what the nipponese tosevites were attempting the guilt never lasted long though for one thing the big uglies would have blown up a similar number of males of the race without a qualm for another the way the nipponese had treated him deserved revenge he wasnt flying in the eastern region of the main continental mass any more his commanders realized his life would end quicklyor perhaps slowlyif the nipponese captured him again now he undertook missions for the race from an airfield almost halfway round tosev from nippon france the local big uglies called the place these are the toughest big uglies youll face in the air elifrim the base commander told him our friends across the ocean who fight the americans might argue but take no notice of them the deutsche fly jets more dangerous than any others the tosevites use and the british had airborne radar before we invaded their island i dont mind facing them in the air superior sir teerts answered i can shoot back at them now he remembered too well lying in tosevite hands unable to strike his nipponese captors hed never known or imagined such loneliness such helplessness shoot first elifrim urged thats what i mean you could take your time with the big uglies before but not so much now the other thing is youll want to use your cannon more and your missiles less why superior sir teerts asked i can kill with my missiles from much greater range if the big uglies weapons systems are better than they were before the nipponese captured me i ought to be more cautious about closing with them not more eager to do it under normal circumstances you would be right the base commander answered when it comes to tosev though precious little is normal as youll have discovered for yourself the problem flight leader is that stocks of airtoair missiles are dwindling planetwide and we havent found a way to manufacture more we have plenty of shells for the cannons though from our own factory ships and from tosevite plants here in france and in italia and the usa thats why we prefer you to use the guns isee teerts said slowly how good is this tosevite ammunition were using i hate trusting my life to something the big uglies turn out we had some quality control problems at first elifrim said teerts wondered how many males had ended up dead as a result of such an innocuoussounding thing the commandant went on those are for the most part corrected now several tosevite aircraft have been brought down using shells of tosevite manufacture thats something anyhow teerts said somewhat reassured elifrim reached into a desk drawer and drew out two shell casings teerts had no trouble figuring out which chunk of machined brass had traveled from home and which was made locally one was gleaming mirrorfinished while the other had a matte coating with several scratches marring its metal it looks primitive but it works elifrim said pointing to the duller casing dimensionally it matches ours and thats what really counts as you say superior sir teerts was less than enthusiastic about using those shell casings in his killercraft but if the race had plenty of them and a dwindling supply of both proper shells and missiles he didnt see that he had much choice are the armorers satisfied with them armorers were even fussier about guns than pilots on the whole yes elifrim answered though for a moment his eyes looked to the side walls of the office a sign he wasnt telling everything he knew when he spoke again he attempted briskness any further questions flight leader no very well dismissed teerts was glad to leave the office lit only by a weak electric bulb left over from the days when the tosevites had controlled the air base and to go out into the sunlight that bathed the place he found the weather a trifle cool but pleasant enough he walked over to his killercraft to see how the technicians were coming along in readying it for the next mission he found a senior armorer loading shells into the aircrafts magazine good day flight leader the male said respectfullyteerts outranked him but he was an important male too and everything in his demeanor said he knew it good day innoss teerts answered he saw that some of the shells the armorer was using were shiny ones of the races manufacture others with the duller finish that marked big ugly products what do you think of the munitions the tosevites are making for us since you ask superior sir the answer is not much innoss said he lifted a tosevite shell out of the crate in which it had come all the specifications are the same as they are for our own ammunition but some of these dont feel quite right he hefted the shell the weight is fine but the balance is off somehow are all the ones the tosevites produce like that teerts asked no the armorer answered only a few with their primitive manufacturing techniques i suppose i should not be surprised the miracle is that we get any usable shells at all suspicion flared in teerts if it is not a universal trait these shells with the odd balance will be somehow flawed he predicted believe me when i say this innoss i know the big uglies and their tricks better than i ever dreamt i would sure as i had an eggtooth to help me break out of my shell some ingenious tosevite has found a way to diddle us i dont see how innoss said doubtfully the weight is proper after all more likely some flaw in the process i have seen video of what they call factories derision filled his hiss their weapons may be outdated next to ours but they are well made of their kind teerts said ill bet you a days pay innoss that close enough examination of that misbalanced shell will turn up something wrong with it the armorer sent him a thoughtful look very well flight leader i accept that wager let us see what this shell has to say to us he carried it away toward his own shack by the ammunition storage area teerts thought about how he would spend his winnings reaching a conclusion didnt take long ill buy more ginger amazing how easy the stuff was to get every other big ugly who swept up or brought food onto the air base seemed to have his own supply every so often elifrim caught a user and made an example of him but he missed tens for every one he found teerts was still busy inspecting his aircraft when innoss returned the armorer drew himself up in stiff formality superior sir i owe you a days pay he said i have already requested a file transfer between our accounts he spoke more respectfully than he ever had before till now teerts had been just another officer as far as he was concerned what did the big uglies do teerts asked doing his best not to show the relief he felt hed gained prestige by being right only now did he think about how much hed have lost had he been wrong i xrayed three shells one of ours one of theirs with proper balance and one of theirs with improper balance innoss said the first two were virtually identical as you said superior sir they can do good enough work when they care to but the third he paused as if still not believing it what did the big uglies do teerts repeated by innoss tone he guessed it was something perfidious even for them they left out the bursting charge that goes behind the penetrating head the armorer answered indignantly if theyd just done that the shells would have been light and quality control would have found them easily but to make up for the empty space within the shells they thickened the metal of the head just enough to match the missing weight of powder i wonder how many shells have done far less damage to the enemy than they should because of that have you any way to trace down which tosevite plant turned out the sabotaged shells teerts asked oh yes innoss opened his mouth not in a laugh but to show off all his teeth in a threat display that made it clear the distant ancestors of the race had been fierce carnivores vengeance shall fall on them good teerts said this wasnt like vengeance on the nipponese where thousands who had done nothing to him had died simply because they lived near where the big uglies had chosen to undertake nuclear research the tosevites who suffered now would have earned what they got each and every one of them the race is in your debt innoss said i telephoned the base commandant and told him what you had led me to discover you shall be recognized as you deserve your body paint will get fancier that was generous of you teerts said a promotion or even a commendation would mean more pay which would mean more ginger after so many horrors life was good like shanghai peking had seen better days the former capitals fall to the japanese had been relatively gentlechiangs corrupt clique simply cut and rannieh hoting thought disparagingly but the japanese had fought like madmen before the little scaly devils drove them out of peking whole districts lay in ruins and many of the palaces formerly enjoyed by the emperors of china and their consorts and courtiers were only rubble through which scavengers picked for bits of wood so what hsia shoutao growled when nieh spoke of that aloud they were nothing but symbols of oppression of the masses the citythe worldis better off without them it could be so nieh said were it up to me though they would have been preserved as symbols of that oppression he laughed here we are arguing over what should be done with them when first they are already destroyed and second we have not yet the power to say what any buildings fate will be a journey of a thousandli begins with but a single step hsia answered the proverb made him grimace more than a thousandli from shanghai to here and my poor feet feel every stinking step i took ah but here we are in the hibiscusflower garden nieh ho ting said with an expansive wave surely you can take your ease hibiscusflower night soil hsia said coarsely he reveled in a peasants crudity its just another dive the jung yuan which meant hibiscusflower garden had been a fine restaurant once it looked to have been looted a couple of times soot running up one wall said someone had tried to torch the place those efforts were all too likely to succeed nieh wondered why this one had failed he sipped tea from a severely plain earthenware cup the food is still good he said hsia grunted unwilling to admit anything but like nieh hed demolished theluweipinpan ham minced pork pigs tripes and tongue and bamboo shootsall in a thick gravythat was one of jung yuans specialties pork and poultry were the only meat you saw these days pigs and chickens ate anything and so were eaten themselves a serving girl came up and asked more rice when nieh nodded she hurried away and returned with a large bowlful hsia used the lacquerware spoon to fill his own eating bowl then held it up to his mouth and shoveled in rice with his chopsticks he slurped from a bowl ofkao liang a potent wine brewed from millet and belched enormously to show his approval you are a true proletarian nieh hoting said not at all ironically hsia shoutao beamed at the compliment a couple of tables over a group of men in westernstyle suits was having a dinner party complete with singsong girls and a raucous orchestra despite all peking had been through the men looked plump and prosperous some had their arms around singsong girls while others were trying to slide their hands up the slits in the girls silk dresses a couple of the girls pulled away not all entertainers were courtesans most though accepted the attentions either as their due or with mercenary calculation in their eyes collaborators nieh said in a voice that would have meant the firing squad in territory controlled by the peoples liberation army they could not be so rich without working hand in glove with the little scaly devils youre right hsia grunted he filled his bowl of rice again with his mouth full he added that one there in the dark shiny green shes a lot of woman and her beauty is exploited nieh answered like a lot of communist officials he had a wide puritanical streak in him sex for sport sex for anything but procreation made him uneasy his stay in a shanghai brothel had reinforced that opinion rather than changed it so it is hsia said niehs doctrine was true but the other man did not sound happy to concur you are not an animal you are a man of the revolution nieh hoting reminded him if joy girls are what you wanted in life you should have joined the kuomintang instead i am a man of the revolution hsia repeated dutifully coveting women who are forced to show their bodiesa chinese euphemism for prostitutionto get money to live proves i have not yet removed all the old corrupt ways from my heart humbly i shall try to do better had he made the selfcriticism at a meeting of party members he would have stood with head bowed in contrition here that would have given him away for what he wasand the scaly devils and their running dogs were as eager as either chiangs clique or the japanese had been to be rid of communists hsia stayed in his seat and slurped millet wine and in spite of selfcriticism his eyes kept sliding toward the singsong girl in the green silk dress nieh hoting tried to bring his attention back to the matter at hand keeping his voice low he said we have to put fear into these collaborators if a few of them die the rest will serve the little devils with less attention to their duties for they will always be looking over their shoulder to see if they will be next to pay for their treacheries some may even decide to cooperate with us in the struggle against imperialist aggression hsia shoutao made a face yes and then theyd sell us back to the scaly devils along with their own mothers that kind of friend does our cause no good we need people truly committed to revolution and justice we would be fools to trust them very far nieh agreed but intelligence is always valuable and can always be compromised hsia shot back he was a stubborn man once an opinion lodged in his mind a team of water buffaloes would have had trouble dragging it out nieh didnt try all he said was the sooner some are slain the sooner we have the chance to see what the rest are made of that appealed to hsia as nieh had thought it might his comrade was a man who favored direct action but hsia said not that the miserable turtles dont deserve to die but it wont be as easy even as it was in shanghai the little scaly devils arent stupid and they learn more about security every day security for themselves yes nieh said but for their parasites there they are not so good every set of foreign devils that has tried to rule chinathe mongols the english the japaneseworked with and through native traitors the little scaly devils are no different how will they gather in food and collect taxes if no one keeps records for them hsia noisily blew his nose on his fingers a couple of the scaly devils running dogs looked at him with distaste theyd learned western manners to go with their western clothes he glared back at them nieh hoting had seen him do such things before he needed to hate his enemies on a personal level not just an ideological one nieh set down five mex dollars to cover the cost of the meal war and repeated conquest had left peking like shanghai an abominably expensive place to live both men blinked as they walked out into the bright sun of the western part of the chinese city of peking monuments of the past glories of imperial china were all around them nieh hoting looked at the massive brickwork of the chien men gate with as much scorn as hed given to the scaly devils puppets come the revolution all the buildings war had spared deserved to be torn down the people would erect their own monuments he and hsia shared a room in a grimy little lodging house not far from the gate the man who ran it was himself progressive and asked no questions about his lodgers political affiliations in return no one struck at the oppressors and their minions anywhere close to the lodging house to keep suspicion from falling on it that evening over tea and soup nieh and his comrades planned how best to harass the little devils after considerable comradely discussionan outsider would have called it raucous wranglingthey decided to attack the municipal office building an ugly modern structure close to the western shore of the chung hai the southern lake hsia shoutao wanted to do there what nieh hoting and his followers had done in shanghai smuggle guerrillas and weapons into the building under the cover of waiters and cooks bringing in food nieh vetoed that the little scaly devils are not stupid as you yourself said they will know we have used this trick once and will be on their guard against it we will not be using it against them only against the men who lick their backsides hsia said sulkily we will not be using it at all nieh hoting repeated the risk is too large whatshall we do then hsia demanded that brought on another round of comradely discussion even more raucous than the one before but when the discussion was done they had a plan they could live withand one which with luck not too many of them would die with the next morning nieh hoting went with several of his comrades to the national library which was just across hsi an meenwestern peace gatestreet to the north of the municipal offices they all wore western clothes like those the running dogs in the hibiscusflower garden had had on niehs shoes pinched his feet without mercy the librarians bowed to them and were most helpfulwho could have guessed they were not carrying papers in their briefcases the day was hot and sticky the windows on the south side of the library were open to help the air move nieh smiled he had counted on that all his companions could read not all of them had been able to when they first joined the peoples liberation army but ignorance was one means through which warlords and magnates held the people in bondage the communists fought it hard that was useful generally and a special advantage now they fit right in until the time came for them to go into action nieh hoting knew just when that moment arrived the noise on hsi an meen street suddenly doubled and then doubled again nieh looked out the window as any curious person might have done clerks and officials were filing out of the municipal office building gathering in knots on the sidewalk blocking traffic on the street itself and generally complaining up a storm he caught the word bomb several times and smiled again now more broadly hsia shoutao had phoned in his threat then he had a deep raspy voice and could sound threatening quite without intending to when he did intend to the result was chilling indeed to make the joke complete hed said the kuomintang had hidden the explosive when the little scaly devils got around to laying blame for what was going to happen theyd lay it in the wrong place nieh nodded to his comrades as one they opened their briefcases the grenades insidesome round ones bought from the japanese and some germanstyle potato mashers bought from the kuomintanghad been wrapped in paper to keep them from rattling about the men pulled pins yanked igniters and hurled them down into the crowd below fast fast fast nieh shouted flinging grenade after grenade himself the first blasts and the screams that followed them were music to him thus always to those who would oppress not just the peasants and proletarians but all of mankind when almost all the grenades were gone nieh and his comrades left the chamber already there were cries from inside the library nieh tossed the last two grenades back into the room he and his men had just abandoned the grenades went off with twin roars the diversion worked just as hed hoped feet pounded toward that room his band of raiders left by a small door on the north side of the library he had a pistol ready in case the guard gave trouble but the fellow didnt all he said was whats that racket all about i dont know nieh answered importantly we were busy with research for the race running dogs often used the little scaly devils names for themselves the guard waved him and his comrades by instead of fleeing the area they walked down toward hsi an men street a shouting policeman ordered them to help move some of the wounded nieh obeyed without a word of complaint not only did it let him evaluate how much damage hed done it was also the best possible cover against investigators thank you for your help gentlemen the policeman said to nieh and his group everyone needs to struggle together against these stinking murderers to nieh in particular he added sorry you got blood on your clothes sir i hope it can be laundered i hope so too cold water they say is good for such things nieh answered the policeman nodded in times like these knowing how to get bloodstains out of clothes was more than merely useful it was necessary nowhere did the policemans uniform display a name or number that would identify him that was clever it helped prevent reprisals nieh hoting carefully studied the mans face he would start inquiries tomorrow a policeman who spoke of stinking murderers was too enthusiastic in his support for the little scaly devils he struck nieh as ripe for liquidation ttomalss wondered more and more often these days why he had ever found the psychology of alien races an interesting study if hed taken up say landcruiser gunning he would have dealt with the big uglies only through the barrel of a cannon if hed taken up something like publishing hed probably still be back on home comfortably getting on with his career instead he found himself trying to raise a tosevite hatchling without any direct help from the big uglies if he could that would teach the race a lot about how the tosevites would do as subjects when the empire finally succeeded in establishing its control here if the more he worked on the project the more he wondered how any big uglies ever survived to adulthood when a male or female of the race emerged from its egg it was in large measure ready to face the world it ate the same foods adults did it could run around and the biggest problem in civilizing it was teaching it the things it should not do since it was obedient by nature that didnt usually present too big a challenge whereas the hatchling big ugly female ttomalss had taken from liu han he glared resentfully at the lumpish little thing not only couldnt it run around it couldnt even roll over it thrashed its arms and legs as if it hadnt the slightest idea they were part of it ttomalss marveled that natural selection could have favored the development of such an utterly helpless hatchling the hatchling also couldnt eat just anything it had evolved as a parasite on the female from whose body it emerged and was able to consume only the fluids that female secreted not only did ttomalss find that disgusting it also presented him with an experimental dilemma he wanted to raise the tosevite hatchling in isolation from others of its kind but required the stuff big ugly females produced the result like so many things connected with tosev was a clumsy makeshift one thingalmost the only thingthe hatchling could do was suck some of the big uglies had developed artificial feeding techniques which took advantage of that with elastomeric nipples they also used artificial equivalents of the females natural product ttomalss didnt care to do that very little of what the race had learned about the big uglies medical technology impressed him he made arrangements for females in the races camps who were already secreting for their own hatchlings to give some additional secretion for the one he was trying to raise hed feared that would make the tosevites volatile but to his relief it didnt and his hatchling enthusiastically sucked from an elastomer copy of the bodily part evolution had given big ugly females the hatchling also voided enthusiastically tosevite excretory arrangements were much messier than those of the race the liquid wastes from big ugly adults strained the plumbing facilities of the races spacecraft but adults at least had conscious control over their voiding as far as ttomalss could tell the hatchling didnt have conscious control over anything it released liquid and solid waste whenever it felt the need no matter where it was it could be lying in its little containment cage or he could be holding it more than once hed had to wash off the evilsmelling liquid it passed and to refurbish his body paint afterwards for that matter its solid wastes barely deserved the adjective they clung to the hatchling they clung to everything keeping the little creature clean was nearly a fulltime job ttomalss learned the big uglies lessened the problem by wrapping absorbent cloths around their hatchlings excretory organs that helped keep the hatchlings surroundings cleaner but he still had to wash it every time it voided and the noises it made hatchlings of the race were quiet little things they had to be coaxed into talking from an evolutionary point of view that made sense noisy hatchlings drew predators and didnt survive long enough to reproduce but natural selection on tosev seemed to have taken a holiday whenever the hatchling was hungry or had fouled itself it howled sometimes it howled for no reason ttomalss could find hed tried ignoring it then but that didnt work the hatchling could squall longer than he could ignore it and he also feared ignoring it might lead to damage of some kind gradually he began picking it up when it raised a ruckus sometimes that made it belch up some air it had swallowed along with the secretions it ate and sometimes it belched up those secretions too in a partially digested and thoroughly revolting state when that happened it sometimes brought the hatchling enough relief to make it shut up sometimes though the hatchling had nothing whatever wrong with it and still made noise as if it wanted to be held and holding it would sometimes calm it that bewildered ttomalss and made him wonder if the tosevites didnt start the socialization process earlier in life than the race did his colleagues mouths dropped open when he suggested that i know it sounds funny he said defensively theyve fragmented themselves into tens of tiny empires that fight all the time while weve been comfortably united for a hundred millennia on the other hand they have that powerful yearround sexual drive to contend with and we dont youre tired ttomalss his fellow psychologists said almost in chorus ttomalsswas tired adult tosevites had the decency to be respectably diurnalone of the few decencies they did have the hatchling was asleep whenever it felt like sleeping and awake whenever it felt like waking and when it was awake ttomalss was perforce awake too feeding it or cleaning it or feeding itand cleaning it or simply holding it and trying to persuade it to calm down and go back to sleep and let him go back to sleep no wonder his eye turrets felt as if someone had poured sand in them when they swiveled as days passed the hatchling gradually began to develop a pattern to its sleeping and waking that was not to say that it didnt wake up once or twice or sometimes three times in the night but it seemed more willing to go back to sleep then and to be awake during the day little by little ttomalss began to reckon himself capable of coherent thought once more he also began to believe the hatchling might one day be capable of coherent thoughtor thought as coherent as that of big uglies ever got it began to make noises more complex than its first primordial yowls it also began to look at him with more attention than it had formerly shown him or anything else one day the corners of its mouth lifted in the facial twitch the tosevites used to express good humor ttomalss wished he could return the twitch and reinforce it but his own features were respectably immobile in spite of the hatchlings increasing responsiveness in spite of everything he was learning from it there were a great many times when he wished hed left it with the tosevite female from whose body it had come better it should drive her mad than him he thought it was not the proper attitude for a scientist but then again a proper scientist got enough sleep liu hans breasts ached with milk shed earned money and food as a wet nurse on her way to peking but for the past day and a half she hadnt found anyone with a baby that needed to nurse if she didnt come on one soon shed have to squeeze out some milk by hand she hated to waste it that way but being so painfully full was no delight either sometimes when she was worn and hungry and her feet felt as if they couldnt take another step she almost wished she was back in the camp shed had plenty to eat there and not much to do but shed also had the little scaly devils spying on everything she did and finally stealing her baby even if it was a girl it washers getting away from camp hadnt been easy not only did the little devils have cameras mounted inside the hut they also frequently followed her when she went out and aboutand she could hardly walk through the gates in the razor wire no human walked out through those gates if it hadnt been for the poultry seller who was a communist she never would have got out one day when he was shutting up his stall he said to her come with me id like you to meet my sister she didnt think the hut to which hed taken her was his own that would have been too dangerous in it sat a woman who probably was not the poultry sellers sister she wore her hair in a short bob as liu han did and was of about the same age and build the poultry seller turned his back on them the woman said oh liu han i love your clothes so much will you trade them for mine right down to your sandals and underwear liu han had stared down at herself for a moment wondering if the woman was out of her mind these rags she said the sister nodded emphatically then liu han understood the scaly devils were very good at making small things they might have put some of those small things in her clothes even in her drawers to keep track of where she was she undressed without bothering to see whether the poultry seller peeked at her so many men had seen her body that her modesty had taken a severe beating and anyhow so soon after childbirth her body she was sure hadnt been one to rouse a mans lust when the exchange was complete the poultry seller had turned around and said to the other woman i will take you back to your own home liu han he turned to liu han sister you wait here for me i will be back soon wait liu han did marveling at his gall she knew the scaly devils had trouble telling one person from another if the poultry sellers sister dressed like her they might think she was liu han at least for a while and while they were fooled as hed promised the poultry seller had soon returned he took liu han through deepening twilight to another hut that was bare but for mats on the floor now we wait again he said twilight had given way to night the camp fell as nearly silent as it ever did shed expected him to demand her body lumpy from childbirth though it was shed even made up her mind not to protest he was after all risking his life to help her and deserved such thanks as she could give but he made no advances he used the time to talk of the paradise china would become when mao tsetung and the communists freed it from the scaly devils the eastern devils from japan the foreign devils and its native oppressors if a quarter of what he said was true no one would recognize the country after a generation of new rule at last hed unrolled a mat near one wall it concealed a wooden trapdoor that hed slid aside go down this tunnel he said keep going ahead no matter what someone will be waiting for you at the far end shed quaked like bamboo stalks when the wind blew through them bobby fiore had gone down a tunnel like this and hed never come back hed ended up lying in a pool of his own blood on a shanghai street but down the wooden ladder shed climbed and then on hands and knees through damp and the smell of earth and blackness so perfect and intense it seemed to close in on her until she wanted to huddle where she was and wait for it to swallow her but on and on shed crawled and at last she came to a rock barring the way when she pushed it aside it fell with a splash into an irrigation ditch and she could see again come on a voice hissed to her this way liu han had done her best to go this way but like the stone she fell into the ditch she stood up wet and dripping and staggered in the direction from which the voice had come a hand reached out to pull her onto dry land thats not so bad her rescuer whispered the cold water will make it harder for the scaly devils to see your heat at first shed just nodded then though the night breeze on her dripping clothes left her shivering she drew herself up very straight this man knew the little scaly devils could see heat that information had come from her and people outside the prison camp were using it in a life without much room for pride liu han cherished the moments when she knew it come on the man hissed to her we have to get farther away from the camp youre not safe yet safe shed wanted to laugh she hadnt known a minutes safety since the little scaly devils had attacked her villagenot even before that for the town had been full of japanese when the little devils came in their dragonfly planes and turned her whole lifeto say nothing of the worldupside down but as the days went by as she tramped through the chinese countryside one of uncounted thousands of people going along the dirt tracks she did begin to feel safe or at least safe from the little scaly devils she still saw them now and again soldiers in their vehicles or sometimes marching on foot and looking no more happy about it than human troops every so often one would turn an eye turret her way but only idly or perhaps warily to make sure she was not a danger to him but to them she was just another big ugly not a subject for study what a relief that was and now peking peipingnorthern peaceit had been renamed but no one paid much attention to that peking it had been peking it was and peking it would remain liu han had never seen a walled city before the closest to such a thing shed known was the razor wire around the camp in which the little devils had confined her while waiting for her to give birth but pekings walls in the shape of a square perched atop a broader rectangle ran for almost fortyfiveli around the perimeter of the city further internal walls separated the squarethe tartar cityfrom the rectanglethe chinese city broad streets ran north and south east and west paralleling the walls the little scaly devils controlled those streets at least to the point of being able to travel on them by day or night between the avenues there twisted innumerablehutungs laneswhere the bulk of the city lived its life the little scaly devils took their lives in their little clawed hands when they went along thehutungs they knew it too so they seldom went there ironically prison camp had been liu hans best preparation for life in bustling crowded peking had she come straight from her village she would have been altogether at sea but the camp had been a fairsized city in its own right and readied her to deal with a great one she quickly had to learn how to get around in the chinese city for the communists kept shifting her from one dingy lodging house to another to throw off any possible pursuit from the little devils one day they took her to a place not far from the chien men the western gate as she came in one of the men sitting around and talking over rice spoke a few syllables that were not chinese liu han recognized them anyway she broke away from her escort and walked up to the man he was a few years older than she compact cleverlooking excuse me she said politely lowering her eyes but did i hear you speak the name of a foreign devil called bobby fiore what if you did woman the man answered how do you know this foreign devils name iknew him in the scaly devils prison camp west of shanghai liu han said hesitantly she did not go on to explain that she had borne bobby fiores child now that she was fully among her own people once more having lain with a foreign devil seemed shameful to her you know him the mans eyes raked her are you then the woman he had at that camp your name would be he looked up to the ceiling for a moment riffling through papers in his mind liu han that was it yes i am liu han she said you must have known him well if he spoke to you of me that bobby fiore had spoken of her left her touched hed treated her well but shed always wondered if she was anything more than an enjoyable convenience to him with a foreign devil who could say i was there when he diedyou know he is dead the man said when liu han nodded the man went on i am nieh hoting i tell you this and tell you truly he died well fighting against the little scaly devils he was brave by doing what he did he helped me and several others escape them tears came into liu hans eyes thank you she whispered they brought his picturehis picture deadto me in the camp i knew he died in shanghai but not how he hated the little devils i am glad he had revenge her hands curled into fists i wish i could nieh hoting studied her he was an alert thoughtfullooking man with the controlled movements and watchful eyes that said he was probably a soldier he said do i remember right you were going to have a child i had ita girl she answered if nieh thought she was a slut for bedding bobby fiore he didnt show it that by itself was enough to earn her gratitude she continued you may know the little scaly devils do things to try to understand how real people work they took my baby from me when it was just three days old and they keep it for themselves this is a great wickedness nieh said seriously he looked up at the ceiling again liu han liu han when they swung back to her his eyes had brightened you are the woman who learned the scaly devils had machines that could see heat yesthey used one of those machines on me to help see inside my womb before the baby was born liu han said i thought they would use it for other things as well and you were right nieh hoting told her his voice full of enthusiasm we have used this to give us a tactical advantage several times already hewas a soldier then he went back from tactics to her but if you want revenge against the little scaly devils for their heartless oppression and exploitation of you you shall have your chance to get it not just a soldier a communist she easily recognized the rhetoric now it came as no surprise the poultry seller after all had been a communist and passed on her information to his comrades if the communists were best at resisting the scaly devils then she didnt see anything wrong with them and she owed those little devils so much if nieh hoting would help her get her own back tell me what you want me to do she said nieh smiled razor wire huts cots cabbage beets potatoes black bread the lizards no doubt intended it to be a prison camp to break a mans spirit after the privations of the warsaw ghetto it felt more like a holiday resort to mordechai anielewicz as gaolers the lizards were amateurs the food for instance was plain and boring but the lizards didnt seem to have thought of cutting back the quantity mordechai felt on holiday for another reason as well hed been a leader of fighting men for a long time of jews against nazis of jews for the lizards then hed been a fugitive and then a simple partisan now the other shoe had dropped he was a prisoner and didnt need to worry about getting captured in their own way the lizards were humane when the germans captured partisans they shot them without further adoor sometimes with further ado if they felt like trying to squeeze out information before granting the grace of a bullet but the lizards had taken him and jerzy and friedrich across poland to a pow camp outside piotrkow south of lodz no one here had the slightest idea who he was he answered to shmuel not to his own name as far as friedrich and jerzy knew he was just a jew whod fought in their band nobody asked a wouldbe partisan probing questions about his past even in the camp the freedom of anonymity was exhilarating one morning after roll call a lizard guard official read from a list the following tosevites will fall out for interrogation his polish was bad and what he did to the pronunciation of anielewiczs alias a caution nonetheless mordechai fell out without a qualm theyd already interrogated him two or three times to them interrogation meant nothing worse than asking questions they knew about torture but the idea appalled them there were times when anielewicz savored the irony of that they hadnt even questioned him particularly hard to them he was just another big ugly caught with a rifle in his hands he started to sweat as soon as he went into the wooden shed the lizards used for their camp headquarters that had nothing to do with fear the lizards heated their buildings to their own comfort level which felt to him like the sahara you shmuel you go to room two on the left one of his guards said in execrable yiddish mordechai obediently went to room two inside he found a lizard with mediumfancy body paint and a human interpreter hed expected as much few lizards were fluent enough in any human language to be efficient questioners what he hadnt expected was that hed recognize the interpreter the fellows name was jakub kipnis he had a gift for languages hed been translating for the lizards in warsaw and he got on better with them than most people did he recognized mordechai too in spite of the curly beard hed grown and his general air of seediness hullo anielewicz he said i never thought id see you here mordechai didnt like the look on kipnis thin pale face some of the men the germans had set up as puppet rulers of the warsaw ghetto had fawned on their nazi masters some of the lizards helpers were all too likely to fawn on them too the lizard sitting next to kipnis spoke irritably in his own language anielewicz understood enough to know hed asked the interpreter why hed called the prisoner by the wrong name this is the male shmuel is it not mordechai figured he could safely show hed heard his own name yes shmuel thats me he said touching the brim of his cloth cap and doing his best to leave the impression that he was an idiot superior sir this male is now calling himself shmuel jakub kipnis said mordechai had less trouble following him than hed had understanding the lizard kipnis spoke more slowly thinking between words in warsaw this male was known as mordechai anielewicz flee utterly futile even if the lizard guard behind him didnt cut him down how could he break out of the prison camp the answer was simple he couldnt you are anielewicz he asked pointing to kipnis the most he could hope to do now was confuse the issue no you liar you are the interpreter said angrily the lizard made noises like a steam shovel with a bad engine he and jakub kipnis went back and forth now mostly too fast for mordechai to keep up with them the lizard said if this is anielewicz they will want him back in warsaw he has much to answer for anielewicz shook his head if he had to understand two sentences why those two superior sir it is anielewicz kipnis insisted slowing down a little send him to warsaw the governor there will know him he stopped in consternation nozolraag has been replaced his aides will know this male though it may be so the lizard said some of us are learning to tell one big ugly from another by his tone he didnt find that an accomplishment worth bragging about he turned his eyes to the guard behind anielewicz take this male to the prison cells for close confinement until he is transported to warsaw it shall be done the lizard said in his own language gesturing with his rifle barrel he dropped into yiddish come along you mordechai sent jakub kipnis a venomous glance since he was still claiming to be shmuel the partisan that was all he could do he wanted to give thetukhuslekher of an interpreter something more than a glare by which to remember him but consoled himself by thinking the traitors turn would come some day it wasnt as it had been under the nazis a lot of jews had weapons now come along you the lizard guard repeated helplessly anielewicz stepped out into the corridor ahead of him the lizard interrogator said something to the guard who paused in the doorway to listen the world blew up that was anielewiczs first confused thought anyhow hed been under aerial bombardment before in warsaw from the nazis and then from the lizards one moment mordechai was glumly heading toward prisonand probably toward much worse trouble than that the next he was hurled against the far wall of the hallway while ceiling timbers groaned and shifted and tore away from one another to let him see streaks of grayblue sky he staggered to his feet a meter or two behind him the lizard guard was down hissing piteously the window in the interrogators office had blown in skewering him with shards of shattered glass like shrapnel his automatic rifle lay forgotten beside him head still ringing anielewicz snatched it up he fired a short burst into the lizards head then looked into the office where hed been grilled the lizard interrogator in there was down too and wouldnt get up again flying glass had flensed him by the chance of war jakub kipnis was not badly hurt he saw mordechai saw the lizard rifle and made a ghastly attempt at a smile the german flying bomb he began mordechai cut him down with another short burst then made sure of him with a shot behind the ear that took care of the two lizards and the man whod known anielewicz was anielewicz behind him an alarm began to ring he thought it had to do with him till he smelled smokethe building was afire he set down the rifle scrambled out of the now glassless window actually almost glassless a sharp shard sliced his hand and dropped to the ground with any luck at all no one would know hed been in there let alone that hed been found out not far away smoke still rose from an enormous crater must have been a tonne at least muttered mordechai who had more experience gauging bomb craters than hed ever wanted to acquire at the edge of the crater lay the wreckage of the flying bombs rear fuselage he spared that barely a glance the rocket or whatever it was had done more than wreck the prison camps administrative building it had blown up in the middle of the yard broken men and pieces of men lay all around groans and shrieks in several languages rose into the sky some men those nearest the crater and those whod been unlucky enough to stop a chunk of the fuselage would never groan or shriek or cry again as he trotted over to do what he could for the wounded anielewicz wondered whether the nazis aim with their rocket had been that bad or that good if theyd intended to drop it in the middle of the prison camp they couldnt have done a better job but why would they want to do that when so many of the men held here were germans but if they intended to hit anyplace elsethe town of piotrkow saythen they might as well have been playing blind mans bluff he bent over a man who wouldnt live long the fellow stared up at him bless me father for i have sinned he said in a choking voice blood poured from his nose and mouth mordechai knew what last rites were but not how to give them it didnt matter the pole died before he could do anything anielewicz looked around for someone he actually had some hope of helping whamoff to the north toward piotrkow another explosion came out of nowhere distance made it faint and attenuated if the germans had aimed the last rocket and this one at the same place their aiming left a lot to be desired kilometers separated the two impacts whamyet another explosion this one a lot closer anielewicz staggered went to one knee a chunk of sheet metal crashed to the ground a couple of meters from where he had stood had it landed on top of him he tried not to think about things like that men started running toward the northern edge of the camp looking around anielewicz saw why the flying bomb had landed almost directly on top of a lizard guard tower and had blown a great hole in the razor wire that confined the prisoners moreover fragments from it had played havoc with the towers to either side one was on fire the other knocked off its legs anielewicz started running too hed never have a better chance to escape the lizards opened fire from more distant guard towers but they hadnt figured on losing three at once some men went down more scrambled into the crater the rocket had made and out the other side to freedom as with the first flying bomb that had fallen in the camp this one left part of its carcass behind by the crater some of the metal skin had peeled off including the pieces that had almost mashed him hed been an engineering student before the war and peered curiously at tanksfuel tanks wrapped in glass wool and at as much clockwork and piping as hed ever seen all in one place he wished he could take a longer closer look but getting away was more important bullets rattled off the flying bomb then went elsewhere in search of more prey mordechai ran the bullets came back kicking up dirt around his feet he rolled on the ground and thrashed wildly in the hope of convincing the lizard gunner hed been hit when the bullets stopped playing around him again he got up and ran some more sneaky bastard someone shouted from behind him in german his head whipped around he might have known friedrich would get out while the getting was good ahead the fleeing men fanned out broadly some making for the brush a few hundred meters away others pelting up the road toward piotrkow still others heading east or west across the fields toward farmhouses where they might find shelter friedrich slogged up even with him damned if i dont think were going to get away with this he bawled kayn aynhorehmordechai exclaimed whats that mean the big german asked something like dont tempt fate by saying anything too good friedrich grunted and nodded most of the bullets were behind them now the lizards seemed to have given up on the prisoners whod escaped fastest and were concentrating on keeping any more men from getting out through the hole the flying bomb had blown in the wire friedrich swerved to put some of the brush between him and the prison camp panting he slowed to a fast walk so did anielewicz well shmuel you damned jew its just the two of us now friedrich said so it is you stinking nazi mordechai answered they grinned at each other but cautiously each of them sounded as if he were making a joke but anielewicz knew hed meant what he said and had a pretty good notion friedrich had been kidding on the square too what do we do now friedrich asked besides keep moving i mean that comes first anielewicz said we ought to try to get far enough away so they cant track us with dogs or whatever they use afterwards maybe we can hook on with a local guerrilla band and keep on making life interesting for the lizards or maybe not this part of poland is pretty muchjudenfrei thanks to you nazi bastards now anielewicz didnt sound like a man who was joking friedrich said yeah well i can tell you stories about that too ill bet you can mordechai said save em or well be trying to kill each other and that would just make the lizards laugh besides the poles around here may not like jews they dont friedrich said with a grim certainty anielewicz didnt want to explore mordechai went on but they dont like germans either friedrich scowled but didnt interrupt anielewicz finished best bet as far as i can see is heading up to lodz its a goodsized city strangers wont stick out the way they would in piotrkow and it still has a good many jews left as if i should care about that friedrich snorted then sobered or maybe i shouldyou jew bastards have had practice with an underground havent you you nazi bastards made us practice with one anielewicz said solodz lodz friedrich agreed cabbage black bread potatoes for variety turnips or beets heinrich jager wished he were back at the front if for no other reason than the tinfoil tubes of meat and butter frontline soldiers got you didnt starve to death on cabbage black bread and potatoes but after a while you started to wish you would no matter how important the work he was part of life in germany these days felt cold and gray and dull he speared the last piece of potato chased the last bit of sauerkraut around his plate soaked up the last juices from the sauerkraut with his breadwhich he had to admit was better than the really horrid stuff the bakers had turned out in that still didnt make it good he got to his feet handed the plate and silverware to a kitchen worker who took them with a word of thanks and started out of the refectory opening the door he almost ran into a tall man in a black ss dress uniform gaudy with silver trim the ss colonel folded him into a bearhug jager you miserable son of a bitch how the hell are you he boomed a couple of physicists who had been eating in the refectory with jager stared in disbelief and dismay at the raucous apparition invading their quiet little corner of the world life might remain cold and gray but it wouldnt be dull any more hullo skorzeny he said how goes with you life might abruptly end aroundstandartenfuhrer otto skorzeny but it would never ever be dull the scar that furrowed the ss mans left cheek pulled half his grin up into a fearsome grimace still going strong he said as if you knew any other way to go jager replied skorzeny laughed as if that had been some sort of clever observation rather than simple truth you know someplace where we can talk quietly he asked you dont have any idea how to talk quietly jager said and skorzeny laughed again come on ill take you to my quarters id need a trail of bread crumbs just to find my way around this place skorzeny grumbled as jager led him through the medieval maze of schloss hohentubingen once in jagers room he threw himself into a chair with such abandon that jager marveled when it didnt collapse under him all right how do you want to try to get me killed now jager asked ive come up with a way never you fear the ss man said airily why does this not surprise me because youre not a fool skorzeny answered believe me i have come to know fools in all their awesome variety these past few years some of them wear uniforms and think theyre soldiers not youso much i give you and for so much i thank you jager said he remained unsure whether skorzeny qualified as a fool in uniform even after most of a years acquaintance the man took chances that looked insane but hed brought off most of them did that make him lucky or good his string of successes was long enough for jager to give him some benefit of the doubt how are you going to twist the lizards stumpy little tails this time not their tails jagerthe other end skorzeny gave that grin again perhaps he intended it as disarming no matter how he intended it the scar twisted it into something piratical youve heard that the english have started using mustard gas against the lizards yes ive heard that jagers stomach did a slow lurch hed spent hours sealed into a stifling gas mask during the first world war he also remembered comrades who hadnt got their masks on and sealed in time his mouth curled down i dont blame them not really but its an ugly business and why did they have that gas ready dyou think to use against us when we got over the channel unless i miss my guess probably skorzeny waved a dismissive hand he didnt care about why what and how were all that mattered to him he added dont get up on your high horse either if the english had tried gassing us wed have shown them mustard gas is a long way from the nastiest thing around we do things better these days than they did in the last war no doubt skorzeny sounded very certain jager wondered how he knew how much he knew and how the new gases whatever they were had been testedand on whom asking such questions was dangerous to jagers mind so wasnot asking them but few of his fellow officers agreed skorzeny went on we didnt use gas against the lizards for the same reason we didnt use gas against the english for fear of getting it back in turn even if we have better being on the receiving end of mustard gas wouldnt have been any fun youre right about that jager said wholeheartedly with the lizards on their island though the english stopped worrying about things like that skorzeny chuckled whats the old saying nothing concentrates the mind like the prospect of being hanged tomorrow something like that anyhow the english must have figured that if they were going down they wouldnt go down with any bullets left in the gun and do you know what jager the lizards must not have used gas in their own wars because they dont have any decent defenses against it ah jager said so someone has found an achilles heel for them at last eh he had a sudden vision of sweeping the lizards off the earth though he had no idea how much gas it would take to do that or how manyor how fewpeople would be left alive after it was done a weak place anyway skorzeny said but they arent stupid any more than the russians are do something to them and theyll try to figure out how to stop you they dont have many masks of their ownmaybe they dont have any nobodys sure about thatbut theyre sure to have captured english samples by now and they do have collaborators theres a factory in the south of france thats gearing up to turn out gas masks to fit snouty lizard faces a light begins to dawn jager said you want something dreadful to happen to this factory give the man a cigar skorzeny exclaimed and from an inner pocket of his tunic he produced a veritable cigar which he handed to jager with a flourish jager seized it with no less alacrity than he would have accepted the holy grail now skorzenys grin though lopsided seemed genuinely amused i know just what i want to happen to the building too do you jager said how does it involve me think of it aspoetic justice skorzeny answered one of rance auerbachs troopers kept singing lydia the tattooed lady over and over again auerbach was damn sick of the song he wanted to tell the cavalryman to shut up but couldnt make himself do it you dumped your worries however you could when you headed into a fight and lydia kansas was where two companies of cavalry were supposed to be going a tiny nowhere town on kansas state highway a twolane stretch of nowhere blacktop that paralleled us s northsouth path through kansas a few miles to the west of the federal road but that petered out well before it reached the nebraska state line lieutenant bill magruder said the damned lizards should have moved into lydia by now theyd better have moved into lydia by now auerbach answered feelingly if they havent a lot of us are going to end up dead he shook his head a lot of us are going to end up dead any which way riding horses against the lizards isnt your basic lowrisk business radio traces have been telling em right where were at ever since we set out from lamar magruder said with a tight grin they should know were gettin ready to hit lydia with everything weve got they should yeah auerbachs smile was tight too the lizards loved their gadgets and believed in what those gadgets told them if they intercepted radio signals that said two companies were heading toward lydia to try to take it away from them theyd take that seriouslyand be waiting to greet the americans when they arrived but it wasnt two companies heading toward lydia it was just auerbachs radioman and half a dozen buddies plus a lot of horses lashed together and carrying cloth dummies in the saddle they never would have fooled anybody from the ground but from the air they looked pretty good the lizards used aerial recon the same way they used radio intercepts if you fed em what they already thought they were seeing or hearing you could fool em they went to lydiaand you went to lakin thinking about carrier pigeons and nineteenth versus twentiethcentury warfare had given auerbach the idea hed sold it to colonel nordenskold now it was his to execute and if hed guessed wrong about how the lizards minds worked theyd do some serious executing of their own he held up a leathergauntleted hand to halt his command when they came to a tall stand of cottonwoods along the banks of the arkansas river well hold horses here he ordered were a little farther out than usual i know but weve got more horses along too since this is a twocompany raid we wont find better cover for concealing them any closer to town mortar crews machine gunners and you boys with the bazooka youll bring your animals forward if were lucky you can use em to haul the weapons out when we pull back if were real lucky well hold the place a while lieutenant magruder said quietly auerbach nodded grateful the virginian didnt trumpet that thought if everything went perfectly they might push the lizardhuman frontier a few miles back toward the distant mississippi and make the push stick but how often did things go perfectly in war he swung himself down from his own horse tossing the reins to one of the troopers who was staying behind only about twenty or twentyfive men would hold horses today the cottonwoods trunks and low branches made convenient tethering points for the animals he wanted to get as many soldiers into the fight as he could the troopers and the packhorses carrying what passed for their heavy firepower spread out into a broad skirmish line as they advanced on lakin some of the sweat that darkened the armpits of auerbachs olivedrab tunic had to do with the weather and the hike some came from worryor rather fear if the lizards hadnt taken the bait and reinforced lydia at lakins expense a lot of good young men werent going to make it home to lamar lots of lshe thought if the similarity in names had confused the lizards they wouldnt have reacted as hed hoped and if they hadnt his two companies were going to get massacred then a few days or a few weeks or a few months from now some hotshot captain back in lamar would have some new brilliant idea about how to drive the lizards out of lakin maybe colonel nordenskold would let him try it outassuming the lizards werent in lamar by then or in denver from way off to the left of the advancing skirmish line came a loud flatbang and a shriek oh hell auerbach muttered under his breath he raised his voice theyve laid some mines since we were here last boys watch where you put your feet not that that would do much good as he knew only too well the lizards inside lakin hadnt been asleep at the switch either as soon as that mine went off a siren in town began to wail the kearny county consolidated high school looked like hell from the last time the cavalry had come to call but the lizards were still using it for their base off in the distance auerbach saw little skittering shapes heading for cover he bit down hard on the inside of his lower lip hed counted on being able to get closer to town before his plan started going to pot but what you counted on in war and what you got werent always the same critter sometimes they werent even the same kind of critter a machine gun started chattering in one of the battered high school buildings auerbach threw himself flat amid dark green beet tops he pounded a fist into the dirt cries here and there said his command was taking casualties if they spent the next hour crawling toward lakin on their bellies the lizards would be able to bring back whatever forces theyd moved up to lydia tell schuylers mortar crew to take out that machine gun he shouted the man to his left passed on the message no radios herethey were all part of the simulated attack on lydia now for the first time auerbach missed them desperately he shrugged his greatgrandfathers cos had managed to run battles under conditions like these so he figured he could do it too if he had to and he had some pretty good people playing on his team as had those officers in confederate gray long before any order could have reached him schuyleror maybe one of the other mortar menopened up with his stovepipe a bomb fell behind the place from which the machine gun was sending forth its firefly flashes then another in front the third bomb was long again but by less than half as much as the first the fourth was a hit the machine gun fell silent cheers rolled up and down the skirmish line but when some of the troopers got up and started to run toward town the machine gun began its hateful stutter once more the mortar wentwhump whump whump three rounds in quick succession the machine gun stopped firing again this time it didnt start up when the americans came to their feet auerbach let out a rebel yell as he advanced quite a few of his men echoed him cavalry units drew a disproportionate number of southerners some of the lizards in the consolidated high school opened up with their automatic rifles those were bad but didnt have the reach or sustained firepower of the machine gun mortar bombs began stalking the rifle positions one by one some were silenced some werent at worst though not a whole lot of lizards were shooting at the cavalrymen auerbachs confidence rose boys i think most of em have gone off to visit up in lydia he yelled that brought fresh cheers and more rebel yells getting through the razor wire around the high school wasnt going to be any fun but once they managed it manage they did the lizards lacked the defenders to prevent it they shot a couple of men attacking the wire with cutters but others kept up such a heavy stream of fire on their positions that they probably lost as many fighters as they wounded once through the barriers the americans fanned out and went lizard hunting always wanted to do this to my old high school one trooper said chucking a grenade into a likely looking doorway no lizard came out ever so cautiously auerbach peered into the room desks and tables were randomly scattered over the dirty floor some of them overturned dust and cobwebs covered the blackboard but he could still read the social studies lesson some teacher had chalked there the day before the world changed forever the corners of his mouth turned down whatever the kids had learned in that lesson it wasnt helping them now the snarl of a lizard automatic rifle said the fighting wasnt done yet auerbach hurried toward the sound of the shooting the lizard was holed up in what had been a girls bathroom surrender he shouted to it then he made a noise that reminded him of bread popping out of an electric toaster that was supposed to mean the same thing in lizard talk he didnt think it would do any good but then the door to the rest room opened the lizard slid out its rifle hold fire auerbach called to his men he made the poppingtoast noise again the door opened wider the lizard came out he knew enough to stand there with his hands high all he was wearing was body paint hed left his equipment behind in the john he repeated the lizard word auerbach had repeated so it probably did meansurrender after all hagerman calhoun take charge of him auerbach said they really want lizard pows well get a pat on the fanny for bringing him in if we can do it max hagerman gave the lizard a dubious look how we gonna keep him on a horse all the way back to lamar sir damned if i know but i expect youll figure something out auerbach said cheerfully which meant hagerman was stuck with it turning to jack calhoun the captain went on go in there and gather up his gear the intelligence staffll want that too the cavalryman assumed a dubious expression too his on account of thegirls sign on the battered door go on auerbach told him they arent in there now yeah thats right calhoun said as if reminding himself that seemed to be the last combat inside the school grounds auerbach hurried to the northern edge of the school the mortar teams and thecaliber machinegun crew were already digging themselves in you boys dont need me auerbach said you could run this show by yourselves the troopers just grinned and went on setting up the mortar teams began lobbing bombs up highway getting the range and zeroing in on the highway itself theyll have to work to get past us a sergeant said weve each got a different stretch of road to cover from long range to almost right down on top of us and as they pass the longerrange weapons thosell drop down to keep the pressure on thats how we set it up auerbach agreed now we find out if were as smart as we think we are if the lizards sent a tank or two west from garden city instead of bringing the garrison back from lydia to lakin his men were in big trouble sure theyd packed the bazooka launcher and a dozen or so rounds for it but you needed to be lucky to take out a lizard tank with a bazooka and you didnt need to be lucky to smash up some cavalrymen with a tank one of his troopers let out a yell and pointed north auerbach took his field glasses out of their case the little specks on the road swelled into one of the lizards armored personnel carriers and a couple of trucks they were southbound coming fast get ready boys he said stowing the binoculars again that apc is gonna be tough a lizard apc could give a lee tank a tough fight a bazooka would make it say uncle though he shouted for more troopers to come up and find cover in the buildings and ruins of the school for once the lizards were doing the dirty work attacking americans in a fortified position outside of chicago that didnt happen often enough the sergeant dropped a finned bomb down the tube of his mortarbang off it flew quite visible against the sky it was still airborne when he fired the second he got off the third before either of the first two hit then dirt and asphalt fountained up from highway right behind the apc the second bomb hit between two trucks the third alongside one of them the trucks and the apc came on harder than ever into the next mortars zone that crew was already firing screams of delight rose from the americans when a bomb landed on top of a truck the truck slewed sideways flipped over and started to burn lizards spilled out of it some lay on the roadway others skittered for cover thecaliber machine gun opened up on them and on the other truck the apc had a heavy machine gun too or a light cannon whatever it was it put a lot of rounds in the air and in a hurry auerbach threw himself flat behind what had been a wall and was now a substantial pile of rubble with the lizards gun chewing at it he hoped it was substantial enough he swore when the fell silent the mortar teams were shooting up and over cover but the machine gunners had to be more exposed and their weapons muzzle flash gave the lizards a dandy target the americans needed that gun auerbach crawled toward it on his belly as hed feared he found both gunners down one with the top of his head blown off the other moaning with a shoulder wound he quickly helped bandage the wounded man then peered out over the long guns sights fire spurted from the second truck it stopped but didnt roll onto its side lizards bailed out into the fields on either side of highway auerbach fired at them he came to the end of a belt and bent to fasten on another one from the ammunition box ill take care of that sir a trooper said ive done it with acaliber weapon often enough this here ones just bigger looks like thats about right auerbach agreed he squeezed the triggers the heavy machine gun felt like a jackhammer in his hands and made a racket like a dozen jackhammers all going flat out even with the flash hider at the end of the muzzle he blinked against the spearhead of flame that spat from the barrel a stream of hot brass cartridge cases each as big as his thumb spewed from the breech and clattered down onto the growing pile at his feet he swore again when the apcs weapon which had gone on to other targets after wrecking the machinegun crew now swung back his way get down he yelled to the corporal feeding him ammo bullets slammed into the wreckage all around him flying concrete chips bit into the back of his neck all at once the shells stopped coming auerbach looked up wondering if a sniper was waiting to put one through his head but nosmoke poured from the apc a mortar bomb had pierced the armor over the engine compartment with the enemy machine dead in the water all the mortar teams poured fire on it in seconds another bomb tore through the roof the apc went up in a fourth of july display of exploding ammunition a few lizards out in the field kept up a rattle of smallarms fire next to what had been going on it was easy street now the mortar teams and auerbach on thecaliber shot back whenever they found decent targets the lizards couldnt hit back not at long range we beat em lieutenant magruder sounded as if he couldnt believe it auerbach didnt blame him he was having trouble believing it himself yeah we did he said well send a pigeon back to lamar let em know we did it and well send back our prisoner with a guard otherwise though well bring the horses forward into town yes sir magruder said you aim to stay in lakin then till i get orders otherwise or till the lizards come up from garden city and run me out you bet i do auerbach answered why the hell not i won it and by god im going to keep it leslie groves stared at the telephone in disbelief as if it were a snake that had just bitten him im sorry general the voice on the other end said but i dont see how were going to be able to get those tubes and explosives and detonator wiring to you then youd better look harder mister groves growled youre in minneapolis right you still have a working railroad for gods sake get em across the dakotas or up through canada our track north by way of fort greeley is still open most of the time you get moving do you hear me the fellow from minneapolisporlock thats what his name wassaid i dont know whether well be able to make that shipment im aware your priority is extremely high but the losses weve suffered on rail shipments make me hesitate to take the risk transporting the goods by wagon would be much more secure his voice trailed away in a sort of a peevish whine fine send us a set by wagon groves said oh im so glad you see my difficulty porlock said now in tones full of bureaucratic relief porlock groves reflected should have been named morlock after one of the subterranean creatures inthe time machine then he shook his head morlocks were machine tenders they would have had a proper appreciation for the uses of technology no matter how lamentable their taste in entrees had grown over the millennia snarling groves said i wasnt done yet porlock god damn it to hell sir if i tell you i want your breakfast fried eggs and toast chucked into a fighter plane and flown out here theyd better still be hot when i meet em at the airportthats what the priority this project has is all about you want to send me backups for my requisitions you can send em any damn way you please but you will send me a set my way on my schedule or the president of the united states will hear about it do you have that down loud and clear mister youd better thats all i have to say porlock had tried to interrupt him a couple of times but groves used his loud gravelly voice the same way he used his wide heavy body to bulldoze his way ahead now when he paused for breath porlock said there are more projects than yours these days general poison gas has had its priority increased to three levels below ours groves broke in when he felt like interrupting he damn well interrupted poison gas is a sideshow mister the lizardsll figure out proper masks sooner or later and theyll figure out how to make gas of their own too if they dont manage it by themselves you can bet your bottom dollar some helpful frog or wopll give em a hand the thing were working on here thoughhe wouldnt call it a bomb not over the telephone you never could tell who might be listeningthe only way to defend against that is to be somewhere else when it goes off rail travel isnt safe or secure porlock protested mister in case you havent noticed theres a war on not one damned thing in the united states is safe or secure these days now i need what i need and i need it when i need it are you going to send it to me my way or not groves made the question into a threat you are going to send it to me my way or else well yes but all right then groves said and hung up he glared at the phone after it was back on the hook sometimes the people on his own side were worse enemies than the lizards no matter that the united states had been at war for more than a year and a half no matter that the lizards had been on american soil for more than a year some people still didnt get the idea that if you didnt take occasional risksor not so occasional risksnow youd never get the chance to take them later he snorted a fullthroated noise of contempt for all the initiative some people showed they might as well have been lizards themselves he snorted again nobody would ever accuse him of failing through lack of initiative through rushing ahead too fast maybe but never through hanging back he had a picture of his wife on his desk he didnt look at it as often as he should because when he did he remembered how much he missed her that made him inefficient and he couldnt afford inefficiency not now thinking of his own wife made him think of what had happened to jens larssen the guy had caught a bunch of bad breaks no doubt about that having your wife take up with another man was tough but larssen had let it drive himoh not round the bend but to a nasty place a place where people didnt want to work with him any more hed had real talent but hed given up on the team and he wasnt quite brilliant enough to be an asset as a lonewolf theorist sending him out had been a good notion groves hoped hed come back better for it hanford groves muttered discontentedly it had seemed a great idea at the time the columbia was about as ideal a cooling source for an atomic pile as you could imagine and eastern washington a good long way away from any lizards but things had changed since larssen got on his trusty bicycle and pedaled out of denver the project was running smoothly here now with plutonium coming off the piles gram after gram and with a third pile just starting construction not only that groves had his doubts about being able to start up a major industrial development in a sleepy hamlet like hanford without having the lizards notice and wonder what was going on those doubts had grown more urgent since tokyo vanished in a flash of light and an immense pillar of dust and since cordell hull brought back word that the lizards would treat any american nuclear research facility the same way if they found it just because hanford was such a good site for a pile groves feared the lizards would suspect any new work there was exactly what it really was if they did it would cease to exist moments later and so would the hamlet of hanford of course if they got suspicious about denver the same thing would happen thereand denver had a lot more people in it than hanford did most of themgroves devoutly hopedknew nothing whatever about the atomic bombs being spawned here they were hostages to the secrets being kept just the same they were also camouflage the lizards flew over denver a good deal and bombed the plants that turned out tires and bricks and mining equipment and furniture some of the latter plants were making wooden aircraft parts these days instead the united states needed everything the factories produced all the same groves didnt too much mind seeing them bombed as long as the lizards hit them they werent hitting anything of greater importance and here unlike in hanford new industrial facilities could go up without being reckoned anything out of the ordinary even if larssen did come back with the news that hanford could be the earthly paradise for atomic research groves figured the metallurgical laboratory would stay here east of eden packing up and moving would be tough doing it secretly would be tougher and keeping things in washington state secret would be toughest of all accepting denvers drawbacks and exploiting its advantages seemed a better bet thatll tick larssen off too groves muttered under his breath if larssen came back from risking his neck for project and country with a recommendation to go yonder he wouldnt be dancing with glee when he found out theyd decided to stay hither no matter what too damn bad groves told the ceiling if he doesnt like it he can go back to hanford by his lonesome he turned to the report hed been studying when that idiot porlock called keeping the atomic piles cool as they cooked plutonium took a lot of water from cherry creek and the south platte separating the plutonium from the uranium took chemical reactions that used more water every bit of that water by the time it finished doing its job ended up radioactive a radioactive trail in the south platte leading back to denver might as well have been a sign to the lizards saying aim here heavyduty filters sucked as much radioactive goop out of the water as they could they did a good job geiger counters downstream from the university of denver were pretty quiet but that didnt end the problem the glass wool and diatomaceous earth and other goodies in the filter the report had a long list grew radioactive themselves after a while when they got cleaned out and replaced they had to go somewhere to keep the lizards from detecting them somewhere meant leadlined tubs and trash cans the major whod written the report was complaining that he had trouble getting enough lead sheeting to line the tubs and cans groves scribbled a note in the margin this is silvermining country for heavens sake wherever theres silver theres going to be lead if we arent exploiting that as well as we should we have to get better at it if he had to requisition lead from outside of town god only knew how long it would take to get here if he stayed local he could control the whole process of getting it from start to finish all at once he understood how oldtime feudal barons living off the produce and manufactures of their own estates must have felt he smiled lucky bastards he said the mustardgas burn on david goldfarbs leg throbbed painfully his trousers had pulled up over his socks just for a moment while he was scrambling through grass near a shell hole that must have come from a gas round that was all it took he pulled up his trousers now in spite of the slimy stuff the medic had smeared on it the burn remained red and inflamed it looked infected mustard gas was nasty stuff it could linger for days he was just glad hed been wearing his gas mask while he was near that hole the idea of trying to breathe with a burn on his lungs made him shiver all over ows it doin flyboy fred stanegate asked in yorkshire dialect so broad goldfarb had trouble following it stanegate was a big blond chap with cheekbones that made him look more like a viking than an englishman the sten gun he carried seemed hardly more than a pistol in his massive thickfingered hands it also seemed anachronistic he should have been toting a battleaxe and wearing a hauberk not filthy army battledress i expect ill live goldfarb answered stanegate chuckled as if hed said something funny from the yorkshiremans point of view maybe he had by all appearances he bemused fred at least as much as the other way round right peculiar they didna want you back stanegate said peculiar he repeated the word with relish making four distinct syllables of it peekyouleeyuhr wasnt much of a they left at bruntingthorpe by the time the lizards got through with it goldfarb said shrugging after the first lizard attack on the air base basil roundbush had been recalled to piloting at once but no orders had come for goldfarb to return to a proper radar station then the lizards started pounding bruntingthorpe with pilotless aircraft and after one of them hit the officers barracks in the middle of the night nobody much was left in raf blue who could give him orders the local army commander had been happy enough to take him on hed said you know how to handle a weapon and obey orders and that gives you a leg uptwo legs upon a lot of the lads were giving the kings shilling to these days goldfarb pictured himself with two legs up and crashing to earth immediately thereafter he didnt argue with the major though hed wanted to get into the scrap firsthand now he waved about him and said and so we find ourselves approaching the lovely metropolis of market harborough and all its amenities which all its what fred stanegate broke in all the good stuff it has in it goldfarb said next to bruntingthorpe market harborough a town of ten or fifteen thousand people was indeed a metropolis not that that in itself said much for market harborough goldfarb had pedaled into it a few times it was no farther from bruntingthorpe than leicester was the three swans served some very fine bitter even in wartime aye thats so ah recall now stanegates face grew beatific at the memory and in the marketyou ken the one by told schoolyou could get a bit o butter for your bread if you knew the right bloke task could you goldfarb hadnt known the right bloke or even that there was a right bloke too late to worry about it now even if the margarine hed been spreading on his bread had tasted like something that dripped from the crankcase of a decrepit lorry aye ycould fred stanegate sighed wonder how much of the place is left he shook his head gloomily not much i wager not much o anything left these days pretty country goldfarb said waving again occasional shell holes marred the green meadows and fields or shattered fence gates but the lizards hadnt quite moved up into market harborough itself so it hadnt been fought over house by house cant you just see the hounds and riders chasing a fox into those woods there ah weel ah always used tpull for the fox if tha kens what i mean whenever the hunt went by my farm youre one up on me then goldfarb said the only hunts ive ever seen were in the cinema looked to me like itd be a fair bit of a lark if you had the brass to keep up the hounds and the horses and the kit and all stanegate said me ah was getting by on a couple o quid a week so ah wasnt about tgo out ridin tthe hounds he spoke quite without malice or resentment just reporting on how things had been after a moment he grinned so here ah am in the army now at a deal less than a couple o quid a week lifes a rum un aint it wont quarrel with you there goldfarb reached up to straighten the tin hat on his head his right index finger slid toward the trigger of his sten gun houses were growing thicker on the ground as they got into market harborough even though the lizards had never been in the town theyd bombed it and shelled it and a lot of their bombs and shells sprayed submunitions that stayed around waiting for some unlucky or careless sod to tread on them goldfarb did not intend to be careless a lot of people who had lived in market harborough had fled a good many others no doubt were casualties that did not mean the place was empty far from it it bulged with refugees from the fighting farther south in the midlands their tents and blankets filled the grassy square around the old grammar schoolthe place where before the lizards invaded england fred stanegate had bought his butter goldfarb had seen his share of refugees the past few weeks these seemed at first glance no different from the men and women whod streamed north before them tired pale thin filthy many with blank faces and haunted eyes but some of them were different nurses in white and some ununiformed but for a red cross armband on a sleeve tended to patients with burns like goldfarbs but worse spreading over great stretches of their bodies others did what they could for people who wheezed and coughed and tried desperately to get air down into lungs too blistered and burned to receive it filthy stuff gas goldfarb said aye that it is stanegate nodded vigorously my father he was in france the last war and he said it were the worst of anything there looking at this id say he was right that england had resorted to poison gas in the fight against the lizards bothered goldfarb and not just because hed had the bad luck to get hurt by it his cousin moishe russie had talked about the camps the nazis had built in poland for gassing jews how anyone could reckon gas a legitimate weapon of war after that was beyond goldfarb but fred stanegate said if it shifts the bloody lizards ah dont care how filthy it is manures filthy too but you need it for your garden thats so goldfarb admitted and itwas so if you were invaded you did whatever you could to beat back the invaders and worried about consequences later if you lost to the lizards now you lost forever and you never had the chance to worry about being moral again wouldnt that make gas legitimate churchill had thought so goldfarb sighed like you said its a rum world fred stanegate pointed isna that the three swans there that used to be the three swans looks more like to me goldfarb answered the inn had boasted a splendid eighteenthcentury wroughtiron sign now a couple of fingerlength chunks of twisted iron lay in the gutter a shell hit had enlarged the doorway and blown glass out of the windows bloody shame theyre not dead yet seems to me stanegate said maybe he was right too the building hadnt been abandoned somebodyd hung blankets over the doorway and as goldfarb watched a man in a publicans leather apron slipped out between two of those blankets and looked around in wonder at what market harborough had become spying goldfarbs and stanegates draggled uniforms he waved to the two military men come in and have a pint on me lads they looked at each other they were on duty but a pint was a pint let me buy you one then for your kindness goldfarb answered the innkeeper did not say no but beckoned them into the three swans the fire crackling in the hearth was welcome the innkeeper drew three pints with professional artistry half a crown for mine he said given what england was enduring it was a mild price goldfarb dug in his pockets found two shillings he was still rummaging for a sixpence when fred slapped one on the bar goldfarb leered at him pitching in on the cheap are you that ah am stanegate sipped his beer one blond eyebrow rose so did his mug in salute to the publican better nor i looked for your own brewing has to be the fellow said with a nod couldnt get delivery even before the bloody lizards crashed in on us and nowwell youll know more about now than i do a good number of tavern keepers were brewing their own beer these days for just the reasons this one had named goldfarb had sampled several of their efforts some were ambrosial some were horse piss this one he thoughtfully smacked his lips fred stanegates better nor i looked for seemed fair someone pushed his way between the blankets that curtained off the three swans goldfarbs gulp had nothing to do with beer it was major smithers the officer whod let him embark on his infantry career smithers was a short chunky man who probably would have run to fat had he been better fed he ran a hand through thinning sandy hair his forwardthrusting beaky face was usually red goldfarb looked for it to get redder on his discovering two of his troopers in a public house but smithers had adaptability without it he would have taken goldfarbs raf uniform more seriously now he just said one for me as well my good man to the innkeeper to goldfarb and stanegate he added drink up quick lads were moving forward david goldfarb downed his pint in three long swallows and set it on the cigarettescarred wood of the bar relieved not to be placed on report stanegate finished his at a more leisurely pace but emptied it ahead of major smithers even so he said moving forward by gaw ah like the sound o that on to northampton smithers said in tones of satisfaction he sucked foam from his mustache that wont be an easy push the lizards are there in force protecting their perimeter and they have outposts north of towntheir line runs through spratton and brixworth and scaldwell he swallowed the last of his pint did that foamsucking trick again and shook his head just a pack of bloody little villages nobodyd ever heard of except the people who lived in em well theyre on the map now by god he meant that literally he drew from a pocket of his battledress an ordnance survey map of the area and spread it on the bar so goldfarb and stanegate could see goldfarb peered at the map with interest ordnance survey cartography so clear and detailed always put him in mind of a radar portrait of the ground it pictured the map seemed to show everything this side of cow tracks in the fields brixworth lay along the main road from market harborough down to northampton spratton and scaldwell flanked that road to either side major smithers said well feint at spratton the main attack will go in between brixworth and scaldwell if we can roll them out of northampton their whole position north of london unravels he glanced at the gas masks hanging from the soldiers belts canisters in there fresh yes sir goldfarb and stanegate said together goldfarb clicked his tongue between his teeth the question probably meant another mustard gas bombardment was laid on as part of the attack after a moment he asked sir how do things stand south of london not as well by what ive heard smithers made a sour face as if the admission tasted bad to him they put more mener more lizardsinto that one and seized a broader stretch of territory in spite of the gas its still very much touch and go in the southeast and the south ive heard reports that theyre trying to push round west of london by way of maidenhead and such to link their two forces dont know whether its so but it would be bad for us if it is just on account of youre goin good one place you think its the same all around fred stanegate said he sighed wish it were so ah do major smithers folded the map and returned it to the pocket whence it had emerged lets be off he said reluctantly goldfarb followed him out of the three swans not far outside market harborough they passed a battery of pounders bombarding the lizards farther south the men serving the threeinch field guns were barechested in the summer sun but wore gas masks gas shells goldfarb said and took a couple of steps away from the guns if one of those shells went off by accident that wouldnt do much good but he couldnt help it the pounders barked and bucked one after another as soon as theyd fired three shells each their crews hitched them to the backs of the lorries from which the shells had come and rattled off across the craterpocked meadow to a new firing position they hadnt gone more than a couple of hundred yards when incoming shells tore fresh holes in the greensward where theyd been goldfarb dove for a hole fred stanegate half a step slower chose the same hole and landed on top of him ow he said stanegates knee dug into his left kidney sony stanegate grunted blighters are quick to shoot back arent they too bloody accurate too goldfarb answered wriggling toward greater comfort or at least less discomfort they always have been i shouldnt wonder if they dont slave their guns to radar somehow he had no idea how to do such a thing but it would account for both speed and accuracy in the lizards response fred stanegate shifted too and not in the right direction whats radar he asked never mind i talk too bloody much thats all the shells stopped falling goldfarb scrambled out of the hole so did stanegate he looked to the radarman curiously goldfarb felt himself flushing he muttered trust me fred you dont need to know stanegate heard the capital letters its like that is it all right ahll say nowt further three clanking smoking rumbling monsters clattered south on iron tracks two cromwell tanks and a heavy churchill the cromwells were a vast improvement over the crusaders they supplanted but not as good as the tanks the nazis were turning out these days the churchill had thick armor but a weak engine and a popgun pounder for a cannon against lizard armor either model was woefully inadequate they were however what britain had and into the fight they went fred stanegate waved to the commander of a cromwell who was standing up and peering out his hatch to get a better view the tankman waved back in his gas mask he looked as alien as any lizard stanegate said an didnt know we had so many cards left in thand if we dont play them now well never get to use them goldfarb said theyll do some good against lizard infantry i hope from all ive heard gas is the only thing that really does much against their tanks unless somebody climbs on top and tosses a molotov cocktail down a hatch the farther south they went the more chewed up the ground became they passed the hulks of several burnedout british tanks as well as tin hats hung on rifles stuck bayonetfirst into the ground to mark hastily dug graves then not much later they came on a lizard tank in the middle of a field had it not been for the men in masks climbing in and out of the monster machine goldfarb would have expected to die in the next moments the lizard tank was not much bigger than its english foes but looked more formidable its armor was smooth and beautifully sloped so that it brought to mind the cars of the future magazines sometimes hired artists to draw as for its cannonif thats not a fourinch gun or maybe a five im a lizard goldfarb said i wonder if the shell would even notice one of our tanks on the way through we knocked it out some kind of way stanegate said dont look like its burnedcould be they got a mite too much mustard in their sandwiches he laughed at his own wit i dont care why its dead im just glad it is goldfarb set his gas mask on his head made sure the seal was tight time to start using em im afraid his voice sounded muffled and alien even to himself fred stanegate understood him right yare he said and put on his own mask hate this bloody thing he remarked halfway through the process although without much rancor when the mask was in place he added better nor breathing that stinkin mustard now mind tha goldfarbs burned leg twinged perhaps in sympathy off to the north british field guns opened up again pounding the lizard defenses between brixworth and scaldwell not going to be much of a surprise with them hammering away so goldfarb said after first glancing around to make sure major smithers was out of earshot aye well if they dont give em a nice dose o gas first off the buggersll be waiting for us with all their nasty guns stanegate said goldfarb smiled inside the mask where his companion couldnt see him the yorkshire accent made the last sound likenahsty goons but however rustic he sounded that didnt mean he was wrong smithers ordnance survey map had shown a country road going northeast to southwest from scaldwell down to brixworth the lizards line ran just behind it or rather the line had run there some lizards still held their posts and fired on the advancing englishmen but others had fled the rain of mustard gas and still others lay in the trenches blistered and choking goldfarb hadnt been worse than moderately terrified by the time they forced their way through the foxholes and razor wire and pushed on by gaw if its this easy the rest o the way well roll right into northampton we will fred stanegate said before goldfarb could answer a flight of lizard warplanes roared low over the battlefield mustard gas didnt bother them they had their own independent oxygen supplies they flailed the english with cannons and rockets everywhere men were down dead or screaming several tanks sent greasy black pillars of smoke up into the sky the lizards on the ground raffled and peppered survivors with smallarms fire digging himself in with his entrenching tool goldfarb panted i dont think itll be this easy any more digging just as hard beside him fred nodded mournfully mutt daniels huddled inside the chicago coliseum waiting for the place to fall to pieces around him the coliseum had been built with the battlemented facade of richmonds libby prison which had housed union prisoners during the war between the states mutt didnt know how the hell the facade had got to chicago but here it was he did know that even if he thought of himself as a very mildly reconstructed johnny reb he sure felt as if he were a prisoner in here too only bits and pieces of that battlemented facade were left lizard artillery and bombs had chewed holes in it and in the roof the destruction didnt bother mutt the wreckage scattered in the interior of the building made it a better place in which to fight with any luck at all the americans could give the lizards as much grief here as they had in the meatpacking plants off to the southwest rumor said some holdouts were still holed up in the ruins of the swift plant sniping at any lizard dumb enough to show his snout inside rifle range how you doing lieutenant asked captain stan szymanski daniels new co he couldnt have been more than half mutts age these days nobody seemed more than half mutts age blond as a swede but shorter stockier widerfaced with gray eyes slanted almost like a japs im okay sir mutt answered which was more or less true he still didnt get up and yell whoopee at the prospect of sitting on his ass but he didnt get much chance to sit on his ass these days anyhow or maybe szymanski was trying to find out if his new platoon leader was going to be able to stand the strain generally mutt said captain i been in this slat since the gitgo if i aint fallen to pieces by now dont reckon im gonna okay mutt szymanski said with a nodyes that was what hed been worrying about why do they call you mutt anyway daniels laughed back when i first started playin bushleague ballthis woulda been somethin like thati had me this ugly little puppy id take on the train with me you take one look at it only thing you want to say is what a mutt thats what everybody said pretty soon they were sayin it about me instead of the dog so i been mutt now goin on forty years if it wasnt that i figure theydve called me somethin worse ballplayers theyre like that oh szymanski shrugged okay i just wondered hed probably figured there was a fancier story behind it sir are we ever gonna be able to hold the lizards around these parts mutt asked now that they done broke through to the lake yeah things are tough the captain said as profound a statement of the obvious as daniels had ever heard but they dont have all of chicago not by a long shot this is still the south side and if they want all of it theyre going to have to pay the price by the time theyre done here theyll have paid more than its worth lord i hope so daniels said weve sure paid a hell of a price fightin em i know szymanskis face clouded my brother never came out of one of those meatpacking plants not so far as i know anyhow but the idea is that the more they pour down the rathole here the less they have to play with someplace else i understand that sir but whenyoure at the bottom of the rathole and they keep pourin all that stuff down on top of you it wears thin after a while it really does you can sing that in church szymanski said eventually though theyre supposed to run out of stuff and were still making more the more we make em use the faster thatll happen mutt didnt answer hed heard that song a lot of times before sometimes he even believed it the lizards did have a way of playing it close to the vest now and again as if they were short of soldiers and ammunition but youd end up dead if you counted on them doing that all the time or even any one time szymanski went on besides if theyre still stuck in downtown shytown when winter comes around again well give em a good kick in the ass same way we did last year thatd be pretty fine mutt said agreeably they dont like cold weather and thats a fact course now that you get right down to it i dont much like cold weather neither but what worries me is the lizards theyre peculiar but they aint stupid you can fool em once but you try foolin the same bunch again the same way and theyll hand you your head captain szymanski clicked his tongue between his teeth you may have something there ill pass it on to colonel karl next time i talk with him see if he wants to bump it up the line meanwhile though we gotta stay alive yeah i know the lizards werent going to make that easy not if they could help it their artillery opened up shells landed just west of the chicago coliseum chunks of masonry crashed down mutt huddled in his rubble shelter so did his comrades when the shelling slowed they came out and dragged newly fallen boards and pieces of sheet metal back to their positions strengthening them mutt liked that it meant he had a good bunch of veterans in his new platoon he wondered how his old gang of thugs was getting on without him hed miss dracula szabo hed never known anybody else with such a nose for plunder somebody here would have a talent for scrounging though somebody always did a lizard jet shrieked past not far above the coliseums battered roof a bomb hit just outside the building the noise was like the end of the world for anybody out there it was the end of the world more of the nineteenthcentury facade crumbled and fell into the street another bomb crashed through the roof and thudded down onto the bricks and boards and broken chairs strewn below it landed maybe twenty feet from mutt he saw it fall he buried his head against the rough wall of his shelter knowing it would do no good but the explosion that would have thrown and torn and smashed him did not come the lizard plane dropped a couple of more bombs a little north of the chicago coliseum close enough to make it shake but the one inside lay inert where it had fallen dud mutt shouted in glad relief and sucked in as wonderful a breath of air as hed ever enjoyed even if it did smell like a cross between an outhouse and a forest fire then he realized that wasnt the only possible explanation or else a time bomb he added his voice more subdued captain szymanski spoke to the company communications man gus call back to division headquarters tell em we need a bomb disposal unit fast as they can shag ass up here yes sir with a happy grunt gus slipped from his shoulders the heavy pack that contained a field telephone and batteries he cranked the telephone and spoke into it after a couple of minutes he told szymanski theyre on their way he closed up the phone pack and sighing redonned it mutt scrambled to his feet and walked over toward the bomb it wasnt bravado if the stupid thing went off it would kill him just as dead in his shelter as out in the open dont touch it captain szymanski called sharply touch it captain i may be a damn fool sometimes but i aint crazy i just want to look at iti thought it had my name on it you and me both szymanski said okay mutt go ahead the bomb looked like a bomb sheet metal casing painted olive drab a boxy tail section for aerodynamics if it hadnt been for the complicated gadget that replaced a normal twirl fuse and for the wires that ran back from the gadget to flaps attached to the tail section he would have taken it for an american weapon not one the lizards had made at all goddamn mutt said quietly after hed walked all the way around the bomb that dont just look like one of ours itis one of ours wearin a lizard vest and spats he raised his voice captain i think maybe you want to take a good close look at this thing your own self szymanski came nothing was wrong with the size of his balls as mutt had he walked around the bomb by the time hed got back to where hed started from he looked as bemused as daniels did thats a us army air force pounder either that or im queen of the may what the hell have the lizards gone and done to it damfino mutt answered but youre right sir thats what it is all right seems to me somebody ought to know about this he reached under his helmet to scratch above one ear reckon those bomb disposal peoplell be able to say more about it than we canif they make it here alive that is they did there were four of them all quiet and unhurried men who didnt look as if anything got on their nerves if you were nervous when you started out disposing of bombs odds were you wouldnt last long enough to get good at it their leader a first lieutenant in his middle thirties nodded when he saw the bomb yeah weve run into a fair number of these he said hed stuck a toothpick in one corner of his mouth maybe in lieu of a cigarette its one of ours but the fixtures there make it nastier than it used to be he pointed to the lizards additions at the nose and tail of the bomb some way or otherdont quite know howthey can guide these things right into a target you fellas are lucky to be here we figured that out thanks szymanski said dryly can you pull its teeth for us the toothpick waggled sir if we cant you wont be around to complain about it the first lieutenant turned around and studied the bomb with his back to mutt and szymanski he said now that i think about it weve run into too damn many of these i used to think the lizards had raided an arsenal or something but now my guess is that theyre making bombs for themselvesor having us make em for them i mean i dont even like to think about it mutt said how can you go to a weapons plant work all day know the lizards are going to use whatever you make to blow up other americans and then go home at night and look at yourself in the mirror beats me the bomb disposal man said he and his companions stooped beside the bomb and got to work their talk reminded mutt of what you heard in movie operating rooms except they asked one another for wrenches and pliers and screwdrivers instead of scalpels and forceps and sutures the real doctors and medics in the aid station hed just escaped had been a gamier crew theyd sounded more like ballplayers than anybodys conventional notion of medical men on the other hand if they made a mistake on one of their patients they wouldnt blow themselves sky high that might have a way of concentrating the mind on the job at hand one of the men grunted soffly here we go sir he said to the first lieutenant the fuse assembly in the nose is fouled up eight ways till sunday we could use this one for a football and it still wouldnt go off the first lieutenants sigh was long and heartfelt okay donnelly weve seen a fair number of those too he turned back to mutt and szymanski sweat was pouring down his face he didnt seem to notice i think maybe the guys who work the bomb factory do a little bit of sabotage when they can get away with it when the lizards were using all their own ordnance they hardly ever had duds so are they all out of theirs mutt asked dont know the bomb disposal man answered with a shrug to dramatize it if it blows up who can say who made it plenty of them blew up outside captain szymanskis voice was harsh this probably wouldnt have been the only made in the usa bomb in whatever load that airplane carried they may be sabotaging some but they sure as hell arent sabotaging all of em sir thats the gods truth the first lieutenant said he and his men set up what looked like a heavyduty stretcher next to the bomb with much careful shifting they loaded it onto the stretcher and carried it away their chief said thanks for calling us on this one sir every time we get one of these guiding mechanisms in one piece it bumps up the odds well figure out how they do what they do sooner or later staggering under the weight of weapon and stretcher the bomb disposal crew hauled their burden out of the chicago coliseum mutt watched anxiously till they were gone yeah donnelly had said the bomb was harmless but high explosive was touchy stuff if one of them fell and the bomb went thud on the ground the bad guys might still win szymanski said sabotage one in ten say and you hurt the enemy with that one yeah but the other nine are still gonna hurt your friends yes sir mutt agreed but even if youre just sabotaging one in a hundred youre making it so you can live with yourself afterwards that counts too i suppose so szymanski said unwillingly mutt didnt blame him for sounding dubious being able to live with yourself counted sure but giving the lizards a good swift kick in the balls counted for more in his book having them bomb american positions with american bombs it stuck in his craw but if they were running out of their own maybe it wasnt so bad after all crashthe shell smote ussmaks landcruiser in the glacis plate the drivers teeth clicked together the shell did not penetrate the landcruiser kept rolling forward toward the village that topped the wooded hillcrash another shell struck with the same result or rather lack of result front nejas said back in the turret identified skoob answered the turret hummed as it traversed bringing the landcruisers main armament to bear on the little gun that was hammering away at them through his vision slits ussmak saw tosevites dash about in the deepening twilight as they served the gun the landcruiser cannon spoke the heavy machine rocked back on its tracks for an instant from the recoil at the same time skoob called on the way he hadnt finished the sentence when the highexplosive round burst alongside the tosevite gun the cannon overturned the big uglies of its crew were flung aside like crumpled papers hit ussmak shouted well placed skoob even now he could still sometimes recapture the feeling of easy inevitable triumph hed known when the war on tosev was newly hatched most of the time he needed ginger to do it but not always skoob said the british here they dont have such good antilandcruiser guns when we were down there fighting the deutsche now and they hit you you knew youd been hit truth ussmak said deutsch antilandcruiser guns could wreck you if they caught you from the side or rear the british didnt seem to have anything to match them even the british handlaunched antilandcruiser weapons werent a match for the rockets the deutsch infantry used unfortunately that didnt make the campaign on this emperorforsaken island any easier ussmak shivered though the inside of the landcruiser was heated to a temperature he found comfortable the british may not have good antilandcruiser guns but they have other things truth nejas and skoob said in identical unhappy tones nejas went on that accursed gas he didnt say any more or need to the landcruiser crew was relatively lucky their machine shielded them from the risk of actually being splashed with the stuff which if it didnt kill you would make you wish it had theyd stuck makeshift filters over all the landcruisers air inlets too to minimize the danger of getting it into their lungs but the landcruiser wasnt sealed and minimizing the danger didnt make it go away in a pensive voice skoob said you couldnt pay me enough to make me want to be an infantrymale in britain now ussmak and nejas chorused truth gas casualties among the infantry had been appalling they moved from place to place in their combat vehiclesa couple of those were advancing up the hill toward the village with ussmaks landcruiserbut when they got to where they were going they had to get out and fight getting out was dangerous at any time getting out with the gas in the air and clinging to the ground was worse than dangerous machinegun fire pattered off the landcruiser at nejas orders skoob pumped highexplosive shells into the buildings that sheltered the gunners the buildings made largely of timber began to burn well seize that village nejas declared the native name ishe paused to check his mapwargrave or something like that the height will give us a position from which we can look down on and shell the river beyond tomorrow we advance on the thehe checked againthe thames superior sir should we consider a night advance skoob asked our vision equipment gives us a great advantage in night fighting orders are to stop at wargrave nejas answered too many casualties have been suffered and machines lost charging through territory still heavily infested with big uglies the gas only makes that worse the shelling had not taken out all the british gunners skoob poured more rounds into wargrave the mechanized combat vehicles also opened up on the village with their smaller guns smoke rose high into the evening sky down on the ground though muzzle flashes said the british were still resisting ussmak sighed looks as if well have to do it the hard way he said wishing for a taste of ginger the resigned comment might have applied to the races whole campaign on tosev landcruiser halt nejas said halting superior sir ussmak stamped down on the brake pedal nejas he thought approvingly knew what he was doing hed stopped the landcruiser outside the builtup area of wargrave but close enough so it could still effectively use not only its cannon but also its machine gun firepower counted being literally in the middle of action didnt ussmak had had a couple of commanders who would have charged right into the middle of wargrave guns blazing one of them had got his bravado from a vial of ginger the other was just an idiot both males would have wondered where the satchel charge or bottle full of blazing hydrocarbons or springfired hollowcharge bomb had come from for as long as it left them alive to wonder nejas hung back and didnt have the worry the mechanized combat vehicles unfortunately did not enjoy such luxury if they disembarked their infantrymales too far from the fighting they might as well have stayed back at the baseenemy fire would chew those poor males to pieces they pulled up right at the edge of the village the infantrymales skittered out automatic rifles at the ready ussmak wouldnt have wanted their job for all the ginger on tosev one of those males went down he wasnt dead he kept firing but he didnt advance with his fellows any more then a british male in the wreckage of wargrave launched one of their antilandcruiser bombs at a combat vehicle the thing was all but ludicrous against the landcruisers it couldnt defeat their frontal armor and usually wouldnt penetrate from side or rear either but a mechanized combat vehicle was not a landcruiser nor was it armored like one flames and smoke shot from the turret and from the door by which the infantrymales had exited escape hatches popped open the threemale crew bailed out one of them managed to reach the second combat vehicle the big uglies shot the other two on the ground a moment later the stricken combat vehicle brewed up advance driver nejas said were going to have to mix it up with them whether we want to or not i fear move forward to the outermost buildings as we clear the village of enemies we may be able to go farther it shall be done the landcruiser rumbled forward shell casings clattered down from the machine gun to the floor of the fighting compartment whats that nejas said in alarm with his limited vision ussmak had no idea what it was of itself one eye turret swung up to the hatch above his head if whatever it was hit the landcruiser he hoped he could dive out in time then nejas said rest easy males its only a couple of combat vehicles bringing up fresh troops these eggimpacted british are too stubborn to know theyre beaten skoob said if we have to send in more males here than wed planned so be it we have to get across the river and link up with our males in the northern pocket and why did they have to do that ussmak wondered the short answer was because the males in the northern pocket not only werent beating the british they were having a dreadful time staying alive neither nejas nor skoob seemed to notice the contradictions in what the two of them had just said they were both solid males gifted militarily but they didnt examine ideas outside their specialties as closely as they did those within them ussmaks lower jaw fell slightly open in an ironic laugh since when had he become a philosopher fit to judge such things only alienation from the rest of the race had let part of his mind drift far enough from his duties to notice such discrepancies those who still reckoned themselves altogether part of the great and elaborate social and hierarchical web were undoubtedly better off than he was night had fallen by the time the males either killed or drove out the last british defenders of wargrave even then smallarms fire kept rattling from the woods below the crest of the hill atop which the village sat an aggressive officer would have sent males into those woods to clear out the nuisance the local commander did nothing of the sort ussmak didnt blame him even with infrared gear tosevite forests were frightening places at night for males of the race the big uglies belonged in amongst those trees and bushes and could move quietly through them the race didnt and couldnt a lot of males had ended up dead trying shall we get out and stretch our legs and wiggle our tailstumps nejas asked the emperor only knows when well see another chance as hed been trained ussmak cast down his eyes at the mention of his sovereign skoob said itll be cold out there but ill come even a big ugly town is better than looking at my gunsight and autoloader all day what about you driver nejas asked no thank you superior sir ussmak said with your permission ill sit tight ive already seen more big ugly towns than i ever wanted you dont want to hatch out of your nice steel eggshell nejas said but jokingly not in a way that would cause offense as you will of course i cant say i disagree with you for not caring about tosevite towns theyre generally ugly before we smash them up and uglier afterwards he scrambled out through the cupola skoob opened his escape hatch and joined him ussmak waited till they both jumped down from the landcruiser then he reached under the mat below the control pedals and pulled out his little jar of ginger hed been twitchy with need for it all through the fighting but made himself refrain males who went snarling into combat with a head full of the herb were braver than they would have been otherwiseand also stupider it was a bad combination now thoughhe pulled off the stopper to the vial and hissed in dismay the little bit of brownish powder that poured into the palm of his hand was all he had left his forked tongue flicked out and lapped it up ah he said wellbeing flowed through him fear loneliness even cold fell away he felt proud to be a male of the race bringing the benighted tosevites into the domain of civilization he thought he could singlehandedly force a crossing of the thames ahead and effect a junction with the rest of the races males north of london with a distinct effort of will he made himself keep his hands away from the wheel and his foot away from the accelerator hed been using ginger a long time now and knew he wasnt as omnipotent as he thought he was he hadnt been all that smart before he tasted though had he remembered how low on the herb he was he could have got out of the landcruiser and found an infantrymale who had more than he could taste at the moment now though hed look foolish if he emerged worse hed look suspicious nejas and skoob both had untainted tongues they thought he did too if they ever found out otherwise hed be sent off for punishment with green stripes painted on his arms but if he didnt find some ginger somewhere before long his condition would be apparent to them anyhow hed be a rednostriled nervous wreck once you started tasting ginger it got its claw in you and you had to keep doing it the exaltation from the herb faded he sank as low as he had been high now the only thing he wanted to do was sit quietly and pretend the world outside the landcruiser didnt exist nejas had had the right of it he was using the vehicle as an eggshell to separate himself from everything around him the world couldnt come in here but it did in the persons of nejas and skoob the landcruiser commander said you were wiser than we driver nothing here worth seeing nothing worth taking better we should have stayed inside well sleep in here no matter how cramped it is skoob added i dont want to be out in the open if the british start throwing gas at us no arguments there nejas said whereupon they did start arguing about who would try to sleep in the turret and who would have the dubious privilege of stretching halfway out next to ussmaks reclining drivers seat being the landcruiser commander nejas won the argument the victory proved of dubious value because among other things he tried lying down on the spent machinegun cartridges that littered the floor he sat up suddenly cracking his head on the low ceiling of the drivers compartment and hissed in pain help me clean up these miserable things he snapped you think my hides armored in steel and ceramic there wasnt room for anyone to give him a lot of help but ussmak opened the hatch above his head he and nejas threw the spent cartridges out of the landcruiser they jingled on the flagstones outside as soon as most of them were gone ussmak dogged the hatch again as his commander had said poison gas made sleeping in the open even less attractive than it had been before even for ussmak who had the best resting place in the landcruiser sleeping in it was no bargain either he twisted and turned and once almost fell off his seat onto nejas except for feeling elderly he was glad to see light build up when he peered through his vision slit day came early at these latitudes nejas started to sit up again but thought better of it just in time he called back to the turret are you awake skoob superior sir the question is skoob have you been asleep the gunner replied in aggrieved tones and the answer is yes but not nearly enough that holds for all of us nejas said toss down a couple of ration bars would you it shall be done the ration bars almost landed on nejas toes he twisted around so he could pick them up then handed one to ussmak when they were done eating the commander scrambled back up into the cupola with skoob and said driver advance us to the point where we have a good view of the river and that town by it henleyonthames after a moment he added on must mean something like alongside of in the local big uglies language ussmak cared for the local big uglies language about as much as hed cared for his egg tooth after it fell off his snout in earliest hatchlinghood he started the landcruiser engine superior sir were a little low on hydrogen he said as he studied the gauges we can operate today i think but a supply tanker should have come up last night ill radio logistics nejas answered maybe they did try to send one and tosevite bandits ambushed it behind the line the big uglies are pestilentially good at that kind of thing the landcruiser rumbled forward ussmak listened with a certain malicious satisfaction to paving stones breaking under the pressure of the tracks when nejas ordered him to halt he hit the brake he leaned forward and peered through the vision slit it didnt give him anywhere near the view nejas had from the turret but what he saw he didnt like the big uglies had spent the nightand who could say how much time before that fortifying the slope that led down to the river belts of the spiky stuff they used in place of razor wire were everywhere so were trenches brown scars on green plantcovered earth ussmak was willing to bet that greenery also concealed cleverly hidden mines we shall begin shelling henleyonthames nejas said gunner high explosive it shall be done skoob said but we are also low on highexplosive shells we used a good many yesterday and as with the hydrogen we got no resupply afterwards before skoob began firing the english down below opened up with their own artillery whitish puffs different from the usual clouds of smoke and dust rose from the tosevite shells as they burst nejas slammed the lid of the cupola down with a clang thats gas he exclaimed with less than the equanimity a landcruiser commander should have displayed nor was ussmak delighted at having to drive the landcruiser through a thickening curtain of the horrid stuff the filters that shielded the landcruisers air intakes were makeshifts and he distrusted them for no other reason than that the race did not think well of makeshifts they went wrong too easily properly engineered solutions worked right every time trusting your life to anything less seemed a dreadful risk to take but at least ussmak and his crewmales enjoyed if that was the word some protection against the poison the british spread with such enthusiasm the poor males in the infantry had next to none some males wore masks patterned either after those the race used to fight radiation or based on big ugly models but there werent nearly enough masks to go around and the gas also left hideous burns and blisters on bare skin ussmak wondered if that was one of the reasons the tosevites wrapped themselves in cloth the landcruisers main armament started hammering away searching for the british guns not all the flying rubble came from that cannons shells radarguided counterbattery fire also rained down on the sites from which the gas shells had been launched lowflying killercraft poured rockets and their own cannon shells into henleyonthames forward nejas ordered and ussmak took his foot off the brake a moment later to his surprise the commander said landcruiser halt halt ussmak did as nejas went on we cant move forward not against positions like those without infantry support to keep the tosevites from wrecking us as we slow down for their eggaddled obstacles where are the infantrymales superior sir ussmak couldnt see them but that didnt prove anything not with the narrow field of view his vision slits gave he wasnt about to unbutton and look around either not with gas shells still coming in have they got back into their mechanized combat vehicles some of them have nejas said they dont do us much good in there though or themselves either the combat vehicles will have to slow down for the wire and trenches but some of the maleshis voice sputtered in indignationare running away ussmak heard that without fully taking it in at first a few times especially during the hideous northernhemisphere winter tosevite assaults had forced the race to fall back but he slowly realized this was different these infantrymales werent falling back they were refusing to go forward he wondered if the like had ever happened in the history of the race skoob said shall i turn the machine gun on them superior sir to remind them of their duty his voice showed the same disbelief ussmak felt nejas hesitated before he answered that in itself alarmed ussmak a commander was supposed to know what to do in any given situation at last he said no hold fire the disciplinarians will deal with them this is their proper function hold in place and await orders it shall be done skoob still sounded doubtful again ussmak was taken aback nejas and skoob were a longestablished unit for the gunner to doubt the commander was a bad sign orders were a long time coming when they came they were to hold in place until the field guns in henleyonthames and the bigger british cannon farther north could be silenced aircraft and artillery rained destruction on the town ussmak watched that with great satisfaction all the same gas shells and conventional artillery kept falling on wargrave fresh hydrogen eventually reached the landcruiser but the ammunition resupply vehicle never came the males of the race did not move forward save for a probe by the infantry that the entrenched big uglies easily repulsed ussmak wasnt very happy about where he was he would have been even less happy though he decided had he been in the northern pocket that one wasnt just stalled it was shrinking atvar paced back and forth that helped him to think to some degree it didnt mean he wasnt always staring at the situation map of britain one eye always swiveled toward it no matter how his body was aligned that kept the pain constant as if it were festering in several tooth sockets at once he hissed in rage and frustration perhaps you were right shiplord he said to kirel perhaps even straha was right though his egg should have addled before it hatched we might have done better to deal with the british by means of a nuclear weapon exalted fleetlord if that be your pleasure we can still accomplish it kirel said using nuclear weapons is never my pieasure atvar answered and what point to it securing the conquest of britain kirel said the accursed island is so small its scarcely worth having after a couple of these devices detonate on it atvar answered gloomily besides our losses there have been so dreadful that i fear even keeping pacification forces on it will be more expensive than its worth and besides he stopped unwilling to go on kirel a reliable subordinate did it for him and besides now that the british have introduced the use of these vile poisonous gases every tosevite empire still in the field against us has begun employing them in large quantities yes atvar made the word a hiss of hate they were not using them against one another when we came to this miserable iceball of a world our analysis leaves no possible doubt as to that point and yet all their leading empires and notempires had enormous quantities of these munitions stored and ready for deployment now they know we are vulnerable to them and so bring them out it seems most unjust truth exalted fleetlord kirel agreed our historical analysis unit has perhaps uncovered the reason for the anomaly seeking rational reasons for anything the big uglies do strikes me as an exercise in futility atvar said what did the analysis unit deduce the big uglies recently fought another major war in which poisonous gases played an important part apparently they were so appalled at what the gases did that when this new war broke out among them no empire dared to use them first for fear of retaliation from its foes one of the few signs of rationality yet detected among the tosevites atvar said with heavy sarcasm i gather this unwillingness to use the poisonous gases did not keep them from producing such gases in limitless quantities indeed not kirel said no empire trusted its neighbors not to do so and no empire cared to be without means of retaliation should its neighbors turn the gases against it and so production and research continued research atvar made that into a curse the blistering agent the british threw at us is quite bad enough but this stuff the deutsche usehave you seen those reports i have exalted fleetlord kirel said his tailstump curled downward in gloom first a male finds the day going dim around him then he has difficulty breathing and then he quietly dies i am given to understand though that there is an injectable antidote to that gas yes and if you inject it thinking you have breathed the gas but are mistaken it makes you nearly as ill as the gas would without treatment atvar hissed mournfully a perfect metaphor for tosev would you not agree when we do nothing the big uglies wreck us and when we take steps against them that presents problems just as difficult in a different way truth kirel said he pointed to the map in aid of which what are we to do about the northern pocket in britain we have not been able to suppress british artillery and it can reach every spot within the pocket the closer our males get to london the more builtup areas they have to traverse and fighting in builtup areas means heavy losses in males and materiel both thats not the worst of it either atvar said flying transports over britain gets riskier by the day not only do the british seem to keep pulling aircraft out from under flat stones but the deutsche in northern france strike at our machines as they fly back and forth to britain we have lost several transports and cannot afford to lose many more truth kirel repeated glumly if we have to start using starships instead and if we start losing starships in significant numbers atvar didnt go on he didnt need to go on if the race started losing starships in significant numbers the war against the big uglies would be within shouting distance of being lost along with them what then is our course in regard to the northern pocket in britain exalted fleetlord kirel asked atvar hissed again he heartily wished the northern pocket did not exist if the british kept pounding on it it wouldnt exist much longer that however was not what hed had in mind as a means for disposing of it bitterly he said if only the sweep around london to the west from the southern force hadnt been halted at the river line we could have withdrawn the males north of london without undue trouble yes exalted fleetlord kirel said dutifully although he had every right to he didnt remind atvar that ifs like this had no place in military planning bringing the males out from the north would be feasible atvar said but with the heavy transports having such difficulty therewith all manner of fixedwing aircraft having such difficulty therewe would be compelled to leave behind a great deal of equipment not until the words had left his mouth did he realize hed abandoned all hope of salvaging the northern pocket the battle there was one the race would lose and he couldnt do anything about it except make the defeat less costly he hoped kirel would contradict him hed phrased his comment hypothetically the shiplord might well find reason for optimism where he saw none but kirel said exalted fleetlord if we stay in the pocket we shall lose not only the equipment but the males as well we should do our best to deny the materiel to the british lest it be turned against us now atvar said truth in a way acknowledging defeat was liberating in another way it was terrifying the fleetlord said if we withdraw from the northern pocket the political consequences will be unpredictable but surely unfortunate they shouldnt be as bad as that exalted fleetlord kirel said his voice soothing we will have kept the british from meddling on the main continental mass for some time to come and other tosevite empires opposing us can hardly be stimulated to more effort than they are already making those were not the consequences to which i was referring atvar answered i was thinking of possible developments within the ranks of the shiplords themselves ahh kirel said now i see he paused thoughtfully my view is that with straha gone it will likely be too divisive an issue for any male to raise his defecting to the big uglies has worked to your advantage because it discredits in advance those who would rebel against your leadership yes i have made a similar calculation atvar said he carefully did not send kirel a suspicious look straha had also been kirels chief rival for leadership among the shiplords now kirel had no chief rival among them after only himself kirel was supreme if he took it into his head to claw aside the fleetlord kirel hadnt played that role when hed had the chance but then straha had been the one calling for his head kirel said as i mentioned before we have met some of our goals for the invasion of britain if not all of them we need not be ashamed of our efforts on the island no atvar agreed he let his mouth fall open and nodded slightly a rueful laugh anywhere in the empire but tosev partial fulfillment of goals is a matter for shame and reproach here against the big uglies we feel like celebrating whenever we can accomplish that much more is relative than the behavior of objects at speeds approaching that of light kirel said among ourselves and when dealing with the rabotevs and hallessi planning can take into account all known variables and almost all variables are known when we deal with the big uglies almost all variables have indeterminate values truth atvar answered sadly sometimes we dont even know a variable exists until it rises up and bites off the tip of our tailstump these poisonous gases for instance the tosevites had them in unlimited quantity but werent using them against each other or against us for all we know we may have overrun considerable stores of them without noticingand the big uglies would hardly have gone out of their way to point them out to us theres a notion exalted fleetlord kirel said we should explore the weapons stocks in empires under our control that may enable us to retaliate in kind against the tosevites see to that atvar said we will still be at a disadvantage against them as their protection technology is ahead of ourshe opened and closed his hands in embarrassment at the admissionbut having the tool in our kit will prove useful as you say start the investigation today it shall be done kirel said atvar went on whether or not we come upon stores of these gases though the point is that we were unaware the tosevites even had them until we made the british desperate enough to use them against us with all too much success kirel said with all too much success atvar agreed the big uglies care nothing for the long term if something will help them for a moment they seize on it in the long run their species may well have wrecked itself had we not come along at this particular time he hissed a sigh but come we did and now we must make the best of it the soviets use of the nuclear device was a similar phenomenon i believe kirel said when we press the tosevitesor some of them at any ratethey are liable to do astonishing things astonishing yes atvar replied dryly to say nothing of appalling and several of their other empires and notempires are sure to be working on nuclear weapons for themselves and if we press hard enough to make them desperate he paused but if we dont exalted fleetlord how are we to win the war kirel said planners back on home never have to worry about dilemmas like that atvar said by the emperor bow i envy them ludmila gorbunova was used to flying over the endless plains of the ukraine and central russia shed seen little of the great forests of pine and fir and beech and birch that blanketed the more northerly reaches of her country around pskov trees dominated not steppe the great dark green expanse to the east had been called the forest republic when soviet partisans used it as their base and stronghold against the nazis who held the city now russians and germans both used the woods in their struggle against the lizards the lizards used them too ludmila was still discovering one major difference between forest and steppe out on the steppe despite vigorous sovietmaskirovka concealing soldiers and weapons and machines was hard work here in the woods it was second nature an aircraft that flew low and slow like her little u biplane was the only sort of machine with much of a chance to look down and see what the enemy was doing as she buzzed along she wished thekukuruznik could also fly low and fast a lizard helicopter could run her down and shoot her out of the air with no trouble at all if it chanced to notice her she skimmed over a path in the forest on the path she spied a pair of lorries pushing north they were of human manufactureone a german model the other an american one probably captured from the sovietsbut where they were and the direction in which they were going declared them to be under lizard control and where shed seen two there were likely to be two dozen more she hadnt seen plus armored personnel carriers and tanks ludmila had heard stories of red air force pilots whod flown below treetop height right down paths like that shooting up everything in their sights people who did things like that got the hero of the soviet union award pinned on their tunics sometimes by the great stalin himself it was tempting but id only get myself killed ludmila said as if someone were in thekukuruznik arguing with her it wasnt that she was afraid the lizards would shoot her down shed signed up with the risk of getting shot down when she joined the red air force but she didnt think the lane was wide enough to let her get the u down it tearing the wings off your aircraft by running into a tree was not what they taught you in flight school that left her with one choice she spun the littlebut not little enoughbiplane through a tight turn and headed back toward pskov the germans had artillery that could pound this position and the area north of it it wouldnt be a guaranteed kill not by any means but it would make the lizards unhappy again she wished she could wring a better turn of speed from the wheatcutter the sooner she got back to pskov the shorter the distance the supply convoy would have traveled and the better the chance for a hit the tall stone pile of thekrom and the onion domes of the churches marked the town the old citadel wasnt badly damaged but some of the domes had bites taken out of them and others leaned drunkenly away from the perpendicular some churches along with a great many secular buildings were in ruins ludmila was a loyal child of the october revolution and had no great use for churches had the soviet government knocked them down she wouldnt have missed them a bit but to have them destroyed by invading aliens was something else again even the nazis albeit for reasons of their own had usually refrained from wrecking churches instead of using the airstrip to the east of pskov as she usually did ludmila brought thekukuruznik down in the park in the middle of town the way she had when she first came to the city again she managed to keep from running over people or livestock men came running to get the u under the shelter of friendly trees she scrambled out of the aircraft and hurried toward thekrom wheregeneralleutnant kurt chill had his headquarters having a nazi in overall command of the defenses of a soviet city galled her but she couldnt do anything about it not now and if chill didnt fight hard against the lizards it was assuredly his backside too people shouted to her asking what shed seen that made her want to land in the middle of pskov i cant tell you that she answered some of the pskovites seemed never to have heard of security well if they hadnt she certainly had she hurried over to thekrom no sentries soviet or german stood outside nobody wanted to give the lizards a clue that anything important went on in there inside the entrance a couple of tall nazi soldiers leered at her the germans often found the idea of women in the fighting forces funnywas willst du liebchen one of them asked his companion a very roughlooking customer indeed broke out in giggles ich will generalleutnant chill sofort zu sehenludmila answered in the iciest german she could muster i want to see lieutenant general chill immediately give me a kiss first the guard said which made his comrade all but wet himself with mirth ludmila drew her tokarev automatic pointing it not at the fellows head or chest but at his crotch stop wasting my timedummkopf she said sweetly if the lizards get away on account of you it wont be my neck that goes into the noose bitch muttered one of the germans dyke the other said under his breath but both of them moved aside ludmila didnt put the pistol back in its holster till she got round the corner another german a captain sat at a desk in the antechamber outside lieutenant general chills office he treated ludmila like a soldier but was no more helpful on account of that i am sorry senior lieutenant but he is away at the front the german said i do not expect him back for several days i need to have an artillery barrage laid on ludmila said and explained what shed seen moving up the forest track from the south the german captain frowned i have no authority to commit artillery to action except in immediate defense of the front he said doubtfully using it is dangerous because lizard counterbattery fire so often costs us guns and men neither of which we can afford to lose i risked my life to get this information and bring it back here ludmila said are you going to sit there and ignore it the captain looked too clean and much too wellfed to have seen the front lines lately no matter where lieutenant general chill was instead of blowing up at her he said if the matter is as important as all that senior lieutenant i suggest you take it to the englishmen down the hall he pointed out the direction in the absence of the commander they have the power to bind and to loose he sounded like a man quoting something if he was ludmila didnt recognize it he also sounded like a man unhappy about command arrangements he didnt need to be happy thoughhe just had to obey germans were supposed to be good at that yes ill try them thank you ludmila said and hurried out all three of the englishmen were in their mapbedecked office along with a blond woman in red army uniform a rifle with telescopic sight slung on her back she was so decorative ludmila doubted at first that she had any right to the uniform and snipers weapon a second glance at the womans eyes changed her mind shed seen enough action herself to recognize others who had done likewise one of the englishmenjoneshad his hand on her shoulder she stood close to him but she was watching the one called bagnall the one ludmila had met in the park when she first came to pskov she felt as if shed walked into something out ofanna karenina not a place where battles got planned but ken embry the third englishman saw her and saidchto what his russian remained on the rudimentary side even so he attracted the others attention to ludmila jones jerked his hand away from the womans shoulder as if shed suddenly become redhot best probably for ludmila to pretend she hadnt seen anything what the englishmen did in their private lives was their private business although she wished they hadnt brought their private lives with them to thekrom in german interspersed with russian ludmila explained what shed seen and what shed wanted george bagnall translated her words into english come to the map he said in german when he was done he pointed to the forests south of pskov where exactly did you see these lorries and how long ago she studied the map it made her slightly nervous in the soviet union maps were secret things not to be shown to the generality she pointed it was here west of this pond i am sure of it and it wasshe glanced at the watch strapped to her left wristtwentythree minutes ago i came in to report as soon as i saw them george bagnall smiled at her by russian standards his face was long thin and bony he was not to ludmilas way of thinking a particularly handsome man but that smile lit up his face he said you did well to note the exact time and to get back to pskov so fast after that he dropped back into english to talk with his comrades ludmila who had no english at first thought that rude then she realized the raf men had business to do and needed their own language for it her irritation faded bagnall returned to the same mixture of german and russian that ludmila used by the time we can get the guns to open up the lorries will be almost to the lizards front linedo you see he drew their probable track up to the line south of pskov marked in red ink seeing ludmilas disappointed expression he went on but the lizards may not be done unloading them a few shells might do us some good wait here he left the map chamber returning a few minutes later with a different sort of smile on his face captain dolger does not approve of us but he is a good soldier if he is ordered to do something it will get done sure enough within a couple of minutes field guns off to the north and east of pskov began hammering away in the short intense bombardment that seemed best calculated to hit the lizards they shifted position before counterbattery fire could wreak full havoc and sure enough ludmila heard incoming rounds hard on the heels of the last outgoing ones i hope they managed to move their cannon she said and then shook her head hoping anything good for the germans still feels wrong to me saying that in german felt wrong to her too she repeated it in russian the woman with the sniping rifle nodded emphatically in fair russian of his own jones the youngest englishman said for us also remember we were at war with the hitlerites for almost two years before the soviet union joined that fight ludmila did remember for those almost two years in the soviet union hitlers germany could do no wrong it was dealing blow after blow to the imperialist powers until it dealt a blow to the soviet union that almost wrecked it forever ludmila said they are our allies against the lizards i try to forget everything but that i trybut it is not easy no it is not easy george bagnall said things ive seen here things i saw in france make me glad we were dropping bombs on jerrys head and yet the nazis give the lizards a thin time of it very strange most of that had been in german but the blond russian woman understood enough of it to say nobody says the nazis cannot fight or if anyone does say it it is a lie we have all seen enough to know better but they do not think why they fight someone tells them what to do and they do it well and for what for hitlerism her cornflowerblue eyes blazed contempt no one argued with her a couple of minutes later captain dolger came running into the room his fleshy handsome face glowed field telephones from the front say our artillery touched off secondary explosionssome of those lorries were carrying shells bagnall had told him what to do and hed done it well the blonde with the rifle threw her arms around bagnall and kissed him on the mouth captain dolger coughed he left the englishmens office as fast as hed come in jerome jones flushed till he looked like a boiled crayfish ludmila turned away embarrassed such behavior by a soviet woman was uncultured in the extreme she expected bagnall to take all he could get from the shameless sniper for one thing men were like that for another he was an englishman therefore a capitalist therefore an exploiter but he broke the kiss as soon as he decently could and looked as embarrassed about it as ludmila felt she scratched her head bagnall wasnt behaving the way school had taught her englishmen were supposed to behave what did that say about her lessons she didnt really know but the more you looked at things the more complicated they got jens larssen pedaled wearily into hanford washington he stopped in the middle of the main street god what a dump he muttered he could see why the physicists back at the met lab had been hot for the place he could hear the murmur and splash of the columbia as it flowed by next to the town it was all the river anybody could ask for and he knew what the mississippi was like not only that the place already had a railroad line coming into it from the north the train station was much the biggest building in town no tracks came out of hanford going south it was the end of the linein more ways than one jens thought but the railroad line was a point in favor of the place with it you could conveniently move stuff in and out without it that wouldnt have been so easy river and railroad two big pluses everything else as far as jens could see was a minus hanford couldnt have held more than a few hundred people any major industrial activity here would stand out like a sore thumb hanford didnt have any major industries just to make up for it hanford didnt have any minor industries either if it suddenly developed some the lizards couldnt help but notice jens looked around both the pile and the plant to get the plutonium out of its fuel elements would have to go underground there were no buildings big enough to conceal them could you do that much digging and keep it a secret he had his doubts its too damn little he said as if someone were arguing with him the only reason hanford existed was to act as a market town for the nearby farmers some of the fields to the north south and west were still green more thanks to the job the lizards had done on pumping stations lay brown and dry under the sun besides the railhead hanfords amenities were of the basic sort a couple of general stores one of them now closed a gas station also closed a school it being summer vacation jens couldnt tell if that was closed or not and a doctors office the doctors office was open jens saw a pregnant woman walk into it he scratched absently at a flake of peeling skin on his wrist back in ogden utah that doctorsharp that was his namehad said some smalltown doc might have some sulfa to give him to get rid of the clap hed tried once or twice on his way here but no sawbones had had any or been willing to use it on somebody just passing through as long as he was here he figured he might as well ask this one too if he heard no he heard no hed heard it before he walked his bike over in front of the doctors office put down the kickstand with his foot on second thought he shook his head and carried the bike upstairs if a local absconded with it everyone else would pretend he hadnt seen a thing jens had grown up in a small town he knew what they were like the waiting room was clean and pleasant all the magazines were more than a year old but that might have been true even if the lizards hadnt come behind the desk sat a pleasantfaced middleaged woman in a gingham dress if the arrival of an unkempt rifletoting bikehauling stranger fazed her she didnt show it good morning sir she said dr henry will be able to see you soon okay thanks jens sat down he hadnt paid any attention to the name on the sign outside as long as it had md after it that would do he leafed through alife with pictures of germans retreating through the snow of the fierce russian winter worse things than nazis were loose in the world these days even if that hadnt seemed possible in the early days of uh sir the receptionist asked whats your name larssen gave it then spelled it for good measure people always fouled up either his first name or his last one sometimes both of them the door by the receptionist opened the pregnant woman came out except for being big as a blimp she looked fine she was smiling too so the doc had probably told her she was fine a woman a few years younger than the receptionist poked her head out the door come in mr uh larssen she said she wore a frayed but clean white coat and had a stethoscope slung round her neck jens went into the room to which she waved him she weighed him stuck a bloodpressure cuff on his arm and asked him what his trouble was he felt his ears get hot id sooner talk about that with the doctor he mumbled she raised an eyebrow she had a long rather horsey face and wore her dark hair pulled back from it and caught behind in a short ponytail iam the doctor she said im marjorie henry did you think i was the nurse by the way she asked the question a lot of people over a lot of years had thought she was the nurse oh jens said embarrassed now for a different reason i beg your pardon that new embarrassment was piled on top of the old one which hadnt gone away how was he supposed to tell a woman even a woman doctor he had the clap he wished to jesus hed read the sign out front gonorrhea wouldnt kill you and he could have looked for a different doctor to do something about it what seems to be the trouble dr henry repeated when larssen didnt answer that eyebrow went up again i assure you mr larssen whatever it is ive probably seen it and dealt with it before and if i havent seen it before ill just send you on your way because with things as they are i wont be able to do anything about it anyhow she had a nononsense attitude jens liked that made things easier but not enough i uh that is well i he gave up no matter how he tried he couldnt make himself say it dr henry got up and shut the door to her office there now beulah cant hear she said mr larssen am i to infer from this hemming and hawing that you are suffering from a venereal disease he gulped and nodded she nodded too briskly very good do you know which disease you are suffering from gonorrhea he whispered looking down at his army boots of all the words hed never imagined saying to a woman that one was high on the list gathering courage he went on ive uh heard that sulfa can cure it but no doc ive talked to has had any to spare no one has anything to spare any more she said but youre lucky here just before the lizards came i received a large shipment of sulfanilamide i expect i can spare you a few grams believe me actually being able to attack germs rather than just defending against them is quite an enjoyable sensation you really will give me some sulfa he said happy and disbelieving at the same time thats great his opinion of hanford underwent a quick degree shiftgreat town friendly people he thought dr henry unlocked a drawer full of medications as shed said she had several large jars of sulfanilamide tablets in there the tablets were small and yellowishwhite she said take three of these five times a day your first day with them four times a day the second day three times a day the third day and twice a day after that until youve taken them all do you have something to carry them in i have plenty of pills but im desperately short on jars and bottles and vials here ive got a spare sock he said digging it out of his pack dr henry started to laugh but she filled the sock full of pills there were an awful lot of them larssen didnt care he would have swallowed a bowling ball if he could have got rid of the clap that way when the doctor was done counting pills he asked her what do i owe you she pursed her lips mr larssen these days you cant really buy medicine for money you can still buy other things though so money has some use a fair price id say would be about two hundred dollars if you dont have that and you probably dont jens reached into a hip pocket and pulled out a roll of bills fat enough to choke a horse dr henrys eyes widened as he started peeling off twenties here you go he said you may just be surprised about medicine too really she said who are you anyway who was that masked manran through his head it was a fair question though people who looked like unshaven bums didnt often go around with enough loot to make them seem like apprentice john dillingers and people who did go around with that kind of loot probably werent in the habit of dropping in on smalltown doctors to get their social diseases treated instead of answering in words he took out the fancy letter with which general groves had equipped him and handed it to her she carefully read it through gave it back to him where are you going mr no dr larssen on this important government mission of yours she asked she didnt addand where did you pick up the clap along the way just as well too since hed picked it up twice he grinned at her as a matter of fact i was coming here now i have to get my bicycle out of your waiting room and head on back to make my report you were coming here to hanford marjorie henry burst out laughing excuse me dr larssen but what on earth does hanford have that you couldnt get ten times as much of somewhereanywhereelse water space privacy he answered those were absolutely the only things hanford had going for it with the possible exception of dr henry but larssen had already changed his mind about the dreadful review hed first thought he would give to the place yes we have those things dr henry admitted why are they important enough for the government to send someone out looking for them im sorry i really cant tell you that jens started to regret pulling out the letter he said please dont spread it around either in fact id be grateful if you just told beulahdid i get her name right i won the money in a poker game or something like that all right she said i can do that you cant afford to gossip as a smalltown doctor anyway if you do you lose all your patients after about the first week i will ask one question though are you going to put a hospital in here you may be dr larssen but i dont think youre an md im not and no thats not whats planned jens said and let it go at that telling her what kind of doctorate he had might have told her other things too things she didnt need to know now that he was here security seemed to matter again he hadnt worried much about it while he was on the road dr henry was visibly disappointed but didnt ask any more questions maybe shed really meant what she said about not gossiping she stuck out her hand and shook his manfashion good luck to you she said i hope the sulfanilamide tablets do as well for you as they commonly do i also hope you wont need such medications again before he could decide if that was patronizing or get mad about it if it was she went on will we see you again in hanford then you may very well he answered that didnt seem to make her angry in spite of her jab she was a doctor and didnt think of gonorrhea as the end of the world he nodded to her opened the door and walked down the hall to the waiting room dr henry called after him mr larssen has paid me for the visit beulah jens nodded again this time to himself if she remembered to call him mr larssen in public she would probably remember not to talk about his letter he could hope so anyhow in the waiting room sat another pregnant woman this one less rotund than the one whod preceded larssen and a farmer with a hand wrapped in a bloodsoaked rag they both gave jens a curious look as he recovered his bicycle beulah said go on in george the doctor will clean that out and sew it up for you she got any o that tetanus stuff left george asked as he rose from his chair jens didnt find out whether or not dr henry had antitetanus serum he walked out of her office lugging the bicycle sure enough the sign outside gave her name in goodsized letters he just hadnt noticed if he had he wouldnt have gone in and he wouldnt have got the sulfa tablets sometimes ignorance worked out pretty well he swung onto the bike and began to pedal southbound now dr henry was also the first woman hed met in a long time who hadnt screwed him one way or another she knew what her job was and she went out and did it without any fuss or feathers if shed been waiting for me shed havewaited by jesus jens said as he rolled out of hanford she wouldnt have fallen into bed with some lousy ballplayer when he got back to denver hed have some choice things to say to barbara and if sam yeager didnt like it well there were ways to deal with sam yeager and with barbara too he reached around behind his back and patted the wooden stock of his springfield then he bent low over the bicycle handlebars and started pumping hard colorado was still a long way away but he could hardly wait to get back lugging a heavy picnic basket uphill on a hiking trail in arkansas summer wasnt sam yeagers idea of fun but getting away from the army and navy general hospital for a whileto say nothing of getting away from the lizardswas worth some discomfort and he wasnt about to let barbara carry the picnic basket not when her belly was starting to bulge she glanced over at him youre red as a beet sam she said really nothing will happen if i take that for a few minutes just because im expecting doesnt mean im made out of cut glass i wont break no yeager answered stubbornly im all right the path rounded a corner the pines to either side opened out onto a grassy meadow besides he went on with a grin not altogether free of relief this looks like a perfect spot why so it does barbara said at first he thought that was hearty agreement then when he listened to it again in his mind he suspected she would have agreed had the meadow been a dismal swamp she was ready to stop walking and she was ready to have him stop toting that basket the meadow wasnt so closely trimmed as it might have been had the federal government not had more urgent things to worry about long grass didnt bother yeager hed played in outfields where it wasnt a whole lot shorter he set down the basket flipped open the lid pulled out a blanket and spread it on the ground as soon as barbara sat down on it he did too now that the hauling was done the picnic basket became her responsibility she reached in and got out ham sandwiches wrapped in cloth napkins from the hospitalwaxed paper was a thing of the past the bread was homemade and sliced by hand the ham came from a hot springs razorback the mustard had never seen the inside of a factory it might have been the best sandwich sam had ever eaten after it came hardboiled eggs and a peach pie that gave the ham sandwich a run for its money the only rough spot in the road was the beer several people in hot springs were brewing but what they turned out didnt stack up too well against storebought brands it wasnt cold either but sam could drink it and he did when he was through he lay back on the blanket with a sigh of contentment i wish i had me a cigarette he said otherwise the world looks like a pretty fine place right now barbara didnt answer he glanced over to her she hadnt done justice to either that magnificent sandwich or the peach pie come on he told her youre eating for two i know she said sometimes i still have trouble keeping down food for one though she looked a trifle green defensively she added its better than it was a couple of months ago then i thought having a baby meant starving to deathor rather eating something and then tossing it up right away thank heaven im not doing that any more you said it he answered well im not going to agitate you about it not now its too nice a daynow that that picnic baskets sitting here on the blanket he consoled himself its downhill on the way backand the basketll be lighter too a lazy breeze drifted through the pines filling the meadow with their spicy scent high overhead a hawk circled blue larkspur and violets great blue sage and purple cone splashed the rainbow here and there across the green grass bees buzzed from one flower to another flies snacked on the remains of the feast and on the picnickers barbara let out a squeak sam jumped hed been lulled by the peaceful surroundingsthe most peace hed known in quite a while whats the matter he asked he reached into the pocket of his chinos if peace dissolved as it had a way of doing he was armed with nothing better than a pocketknife but barbara pointed to the blanket and said a little green lizard just ran across there i didnt see it till it jumped out of the grass now its gone again i know the ones you mean sam said relaxing they can change colorssometimes theyre brown instead of green people around here call em chameleons on account of that but i dont think they are not really they dont have the funny eyes real chameleons do the ones that go every which way like lizards eye turrets barbara sniffed i was looking for sympathy not herpetology she said but she was laughing while she said it then everything but concentration drained from her face her face was turned toward sam but she was looking inward the babys moving she murmured her eyes got wide moving heckhes kicking like nobodys business come here sam you should be able to feel this he slid across the blanket toward her she pulled the shirttail of her thin white cotton blouse out from the waistband of her pleated skirt he set his hand on her belly just below her navel when she had clothes on you couldnt see she was pregnant or not and be sure but you could feel the mound that had begun to rise there her flesh was warm and beaded with sweat from the sticky day hes stopped barbara said disappointed no waitdid you feel that i sure did yeager said something hadflutteredunder his palm hed felt it a few times before but it never failed to awe him he closed his hand into a fist tapped gently on her belly hello anybody home barbara made her voice high and squeaky im sorry im not ready to come out yet they both laughed somewhere back in the forest a wood thrush trilled but for the droning of the bees that was the only sound the two of them might have had the national park to themselves lazily sam slid his hand up under the blouse to cup her left breast through the fabric of her brassieregently because she was still often sensitive what do you think youre doing barbara said she looked around to see who might be watching no one was no one probably was within a mile of them i thinki hopeim getting ready to make love to my wife he answered how about that he pulled the blouse all the way out of her skirt then bent down to kiss the spot where his hand had rested to feel the baby move how about that she said softly she reached around to the back of her neck through endless practice women learn to work buttons behind them as smoothly as men do those they can see she pulled the blouse up and over her head sam unhooked her bra and tossed it on the blanket her breasts were fuller than they had been her nipples larger and darker he lowered his head to one of them barbara sighed her head lolled back her breasts were sensitive to more than pain these days presently he got out of his own clothes in weather like this bare skin felt best anyhow barbara was still wearing her skirt he slid his hand under it peeled down her panties and tossed them on top of the bra then his hand returned when he kissed her at the same time she set one hand on the back of his head and pulled him to her her other hand toyed with him after a couple of minutes of that he couldnt stand to wait any more he started to hike up her skirt but she said no take it off me in such urgent tones that he quickly did as she asked sometimes being smart didnt amount to anything more than knowing when not to ask questions they both glistened with sweat when they were through their skins slid greasily across each other barbara dressed in what seemed like no time flat hurry up she hissed to sam when she saw he wasnt in quite such a rush he looked down at his stillbare self and shrugged okay he said and sped up as he buttoned his shirt and tucked it into his trousers he went on i guess ive spent so much time in the buff in locker rooms and things i dont much worry about getting caught that way all well and good barbara answered but getting caught naked with me is different from getting caught naked with a bunch of baseball playersor at least i hope it is you better believe it he said and got a chuckle out of her he folded up the blanket and stowed it inside the picnic basket the napkins that had wrapped the sandwiches went in there too so did the empty bottles of beer and even their corksealed lids you couldnt afford to waste anything not with the war going the way it was even so the picnic basket had been a good deal heavier on the way up the trail they were almost out of hot springs national park when barbara said in a small voice im sorry i barked at you back there sam raised a questioning eyebrow looking down at the ground barbara went on i mean about hiking up my skirt i remembered a time when she didnt go on yeager kicked at the dirt what she probably meant was that she remembered a time when jens larssen had hiked up her skirt if she hadnt thought jens was dead she never would have ended up with him he knew that damn well after a few secondsmaybe a couple of seconds too longhe said dont worry about it nobody here but the two of us now thats what counts with a laugh he set his hand on her belly again nobody here but the three of us i mean barbara nodded they walked onthats what reallycounts sam thought if she hadnt been pregnant dollars to doughnuts she would have gone back to larssen when she found out he was alive yeager still marveled that she hadnt you play half your life in the minor leagueand most of that in the low minors to bootyou get used to winding up on the short end of the stick winning a big one like having the woman youve fallen in love with pick you instead of the other guythat was pretty special when they rounded the last corner and came into sight of the army and navy general hospital barbara slipped her hand into his he squeezed it gratefully every once in a while he wondered whether she regretted the choice shed made that was another question he was smart enough never ever to ask a horsedrawn wagon pulled up in front of the two towers of the hospital building just as he and barbara got to the entrance a gieven if the fellow was in civvies yeager knew one when he saw onetook a gadget a lizardylooking gadget from the bed of the wagon and started to carry it in what the devil you got there yeager asked him the thing whatever it was was cylindrical maybe a foot long and three or four inches wide with a glittering lens at one end and some wires trailing off the other bomb guider the man answered which left sam unenlightened the fellow went on we took it from a lizard dude up in chicago figured wed bring it down here to get the straight skinny on what it does and how it does it weve got several up there and we cant make em work worth a damn he pointed at yeager you talk lizard talk matter of fact i do not too bad yeager answered okay i figured a lot of guys down here would the gi said you know whatskelkwank means thats what the lizard pows say when they talk about this stupid thing and nobody up north can make it make sense skelkwankyeager echoed yeah thats a word ive run into he was damn glad it was too saying you were an expert and then showing you werent got old fast its something to do with lightim not sure exactly what and im not sure anybody else human is either ive heard lizards sayskelkwank when theyre talking about rangefinders things like that that helps some the fellow said nodding howsskelkwank light different than any other kind though there youve got me sam admitted tell you whatbring that thing inside and well round up a lizard or two and ask em some questions theyre pretty good about giving straight answers as soon as they get captured they figure were their superiors now and they have to obey us theyre not as ornery as people you know what i mean once theyre caught theyre not maybe the man with theskelkwank device said long as theyre still carrying guns theyre no fun at all sam gave an emphatic cough to show he agreed with that the other fellow understood and nodded barbara said here sam youre working again give me the picnic basket ill take care of it okay honey sam held the door open for her and for the soldier with the lizard gadget then followed them into the lobby of the hospital building he spotted ristin there talking with one of the human doctors ristin waved to him a human gesture hed picked up sam waved back and then waved him over ristin came up gaudy in his americanflag style official pow body paint hello superior sir he said in his hissing english you need me sure do pal yeager pointed to the device the other man held tell me about that thing will you ristin turned one eye turret toward it that that is askelkwank sight i think maybe from a bomb artillery shells use a smaller modelskelkwank in your language is is he paused and fluttered his lingers a lizardy way of showing frustration i think your language has not this word yep that is what think the fellow with theskelkwank sight snorted in amusement first time i ever heard a lizard go yep yeager kicked at the carpet he got that from me he said mildly embarrassed im the guy he learned english from and i say it made me laugh too first time i heard it from him he turned back to ristin okay we dont have a word for itskelkwank has to do with light right what makesskelkwank light special why it comes from aftaskelkwank of course ristin said tackingfta onto the front of a word in lizard talk was about like tackinger onto the back of one in english aftaskelkwank was something that turned lightskelkwank askelkwanker in other words the only trouble was that didnt help much withskelkwank still undefined of course yeager said with a sigh what does theftaskelkwank do with the light to change it from regular toskelkwank it makes the light ristin used another lizard word sam turned to the fellow with the gadget ive heard that term before too it means something like coherent i dont know what that means here though coherent yep ristin liked learning new english words most light ordinary light is of waves of all different lengths photonsis right word of all different energies coherent light has only one length of wave only one energy is all exact same color you could say so if i put red cellophane on top of my flashlight lens id have coherent light sam asked trying to figure out what the lizard meant nep i mean nope ristins mouth fell open he was laughing at himself not all photons of exact same energy only close not all going in exact same direction this is what coherent means the gi with the lizardskelkwank device said okay howdo you get this uh coherent light take rod made of right kind of crystal ristin answered grind ends very very flat put on coating like mirror pump energy into the crystal coherent light will come out is one way are others for all the sense he made he might as well have suddenly started speaking tibetan yeager had seen that happen before when the lizards talked about goodies they had and people didnt he said never mind how what can you do witha ftaskelkwank once youve got it aim it at say one of your landcruisersno tanks you sayskelkwank sight here sees that coherent light reflected guides rocket or bomb straight to it this is why we do not miss much when we use these sights the soldier stuck the sight under ristins snout how does it see the coherent light and not any other kind how ristin turned one eye on the sight the other on the soldier he started to answer spluttered stopped started over stopped again i do not know how it does this i only know that it does this hes just a dogface like me yeager said or a dogface like i used to beive got three stripes when im not in civvies you want more than that friend weve got a couple of lizard technicians down here wholl talk as long as youll listen the fellow with the sight stared at sam you got this much out of an ordinary lizard soldier holy jesus sergeant up north theyve been beating around the bush with technicians who havent said as much in weeks as i just got in ten minutes here youre doing a hell of a job thanks very much sam said here let me take you over to major houlihan hell be able to fix you up with the lizards who can tell you the most he patted ristin on his scaly shoulder thanks for helping us out it is for me a pleasure superior sir ristin said yeager was still grinning when he got upstairs he told the story to barbara who listened while he burbled on when he was done she said why should you be so surprised when somebody tells you youre good at what you do because its not anything like something i imagined i could be good at and because i dont have any education to speak ofyou know that honeyand because its important to the country he answered suppose you got into riveting some kind of way and after a little while on the job you riveted more wings onto bs than anybody else at the plant even people whove been riveting for twenty years wouldnt you be surprised about that but sam nobodys been talking with the lizards for twenty years barbara reminded him you have more experience at that than just about anyone else here and you may not have thought youd be good at it but by now you should have seen that you are she gave him the kind of appraising look that always made him nervous lest she see less than she wanted isnt that what youd call bushleague thinking thinking youre not good enough for the big time he stared at her what are you doing using baseball talk on me im married to you remember she answered sticking her tongue out at him dont you think id look for some way to get ideas through your thick head sam walked over and gave her a big kiss im a heck of a lucky guy you know that when i got you i wasnt thinking bush league at all not even a little bit thats good she said we keep on like this for another thirty or forty years and well have something pretty fine he nodded she pulled back a little as his beard rasped her cheek that unfortunately reminded him how unlikely they were to live another thirty or forty years or to be free if they did live so long the pitching deck of a ship in the baltic did not strike vyacheslav molotov as the ideal locale on which to hold diplomatic negotiations stalin however had not asked his opinion merely sent him forth being aboard ship had one advantage it meant he could avoid flying an experience he heartily loathed molotov watched the fishing vessel approach it flew a danish flag white cross on red his own ship sported the red gold and green ensign of lithuania even though that unhappy land had first been incorporated into the ussr and then overrun by the nazis but the lizards were more likely to shoot at vessels displaying german and soviet flags than those of small weak nations a signal light blinked across the water from the fishing boat comrade foreign minister it is indeed the vessel of the german foreign minister the captain said they ask permission to come alongside i am ready to meet with von ribbentrop molotov saidnot eager but ready as for matters of shiphandling that is why you are here is it not yes comrade foreign commissar the captain met icy sarcasm with wooden obedience i shall have them convey the foreign minister to this vessel you had better molotov answered anyone who thinks i am going to board thatscowis sadly mistaken the soviet ship in lithuanian colors was a rustbucket freighter next to the fishing boat now sidling up to it it seemed a decadent capitalist luxury liner by comparison a strong odor of stale herring made molotov wrinkle his noseor perhaps he thought it was only ribbentrop and his nazi policies he was smelling a couple of sailors let down a rope ladder to the deck of the fishing boat the german foreign minister scrambled up to the soviet ship like a monkey closely followed by his interpreter who rather resembled one molotovs own interpreter appeared at his elbow each side guarded itself against twisted meaning from the other ribbentrop turned his complacent popeyed face marbled with fat like expensive beef toward the lithuanian flag half sketching a salute to that banner of a country which no longer existed he said i honor the brave lithuanian people molotov was more than a little surprised his opposite number remembered that flag represented lithuania rather than estonia or latvia he was also coldly furious though he kept his face and voice expressionless as he replied if you honor them so much why did germany include lithuania in the territory designated as a soviet sphere of influence in the sovietgerman nonaggression pact of which you helped negotiate you do recall that clause i trust ribbentrop coughed and spluttered and turned a mottled shade of red thanks to hitlers favor he could bluster his way through the nazi hierarchy but that meant nothing to molotov well let us speak of the present and not of the past ribbentrop said with the air of a man making a great concession you would have been welladvised to do that from the beginning molotov said do not take that tone with me ribbentrop snapped the bluster returning to his voice what was the old saying the german was either at your throat or at your feetmuch truth thereno middle ground the foreign minister went on just because you have managed to set off one explosivemetal bomb you should not count yourselves little tin gods we germans are nearly to the point of being able to do that as well and we are also deploying other new weapons in the fight against the lizards your nerve gases you mean molotov said reluctantly ribbentrop nodded molotov remarked you germans seem as reluctant to speak of your successes gassing lizards as you were of your earlier successes gassing jews the eyes of molotovs interpreter slid to him for a moment maybe he shaded the translation for ribbentrops man murmured into his principals ear afterwards ribbentrop said i am given to understand that the chemical weapon bureau of the red army has made inquiries as to the formula for these gasesboth kinds molotov changed the subject the closest he would come to acknowledging the hit let us detail the ways in which our two governments can cooperate in our common struggle against the imperialist aggressors stalin was nervous about the germans poison gas nuclear bombs as yet were too bulky to fit into any rocket mere humans could build the same did not hold true for gas only the stretch of lizard territory in what had been poland kept the soil of the soviet union from being vulnerable to german rockets loaded with invisible death ribbentrop said this is why we were to meet here in this way the rudeness that has gone on is distracting he seemed blithely unaware he had begun the rudeness himself that probably was no affectation either the nazis had a remarkable knack for ignoring their own flaws let us try to be polite to each other for the rest of this meeting then molotov was not sure that was possible but he would make the effort since thefuhrer requested this meeting of general secretary stalin i presume you will enlighten me as to what he intended to accomplish by it ribbentrop gave a fishy stare as if suspecting sarcasm molotov doubted he would recognize it tillor perhaps even afterit chewed out the seat of his pants the german foreign minister said indeed yes thefuhrer wishes to discuss with you the possibilities of coordinating our future use of explosivemetal bombs against the lizards does he molotov had a good reason to stall for time having nearly exhausted its store of explosive metal with its first blast the soviet union despite frantic work was nowhere near ready to loose another one hearing that the nazis were close enough to having a weapon of their own to want to talk with the ussr about how best to use it was disquieting to say the least but ribbentrop nodded his pop eyes bulging like a netted breams that is his purpose yes between these explosivemetal bombs and our poison gas we are in a position to make this world a very unpleasant place for the invaders and for ourselves molotov said the last time i discussed with hitler the use of explosivemetal bombs his principal aim was to level poland with them and to use the poisons that spread from them to wreck the soviet union as well to this we could not possibly agree i hope also that your engineers and scientists are more careful than they were earlier at producing explosive metal without wrecking themselves in the process he wondered if ribbentrop would resent any of that it sounded sardonic but every word of it was true the german foreign minister said production problems seem well on their way to solution that is good news molotov lied is it not ribbentrop agreed not noticing the lie at alllike a fat puppy molotov thought scornfullyand then he wonders why he gets kicked ribbentrop went on we were fortunate when the lizards diverted forces from their offensive against us to assail england that let us stop them at the rhine they had come uncomfortably close to our research facilities how fortunate for you that they were halted molotov agreed tonelessly if hed been himmler he would have had ribbentrops interpreter reporting back to him and if hed been himmler hed have had some sharp things to say to ribbentrop about talking too much molotov knew better than to reveal even in the most general terms where the soviet nuclear weapons project was based yes wasnt it ribbentrop said without a shred of guile thefuhrer still is of the opinion that punishing the lizards and the jews in poland is the best strategic course to take it would open up that blocked passage between germany and the soviet union and permit direct communications between our two great countries once more this could be vital in carrying on the war the war against whom molotov asked general secretary stalin views the lizard presence in poland at least for the time being as a useful buffer between us if we do not touch we cannot fightand you cannot resupply your troops inside the soviet union as they exhaust their stores they become mare and more dependent on usand vulnerable to us ribbentrop looked so innocent molotov expected a halo to spring into being above his head at any moment thereich has no intention of continuing its former campaign against the soviet union circumstances have changed circumstances changed as you put it in and then changed again in they could change yet again at a moments notice molotov said thus the value of the buffer if we do not cooperate against the lizards we shall never have the chance to pursue our private grievances ribbentrop answered that was the first sensible thing hed said since he boarded the russian freighter molotov eyed him warily true enough but cooperation must run both ways if you enjoy all the advantages you must not expect us to be your dupes if we did not honestly cooperate with you you would not have got the explosive metal from which to make your bomb ribbentrop said do remember that half the team which took the metal was made up of german soldiers who supplied all the heavy weapons for the raid true enough molotov said and then paused to think ribbentrop had now made sense twice running which as far as the foreign commissar knew equaled his alltime record was the jumpedup champagne salesman actually developing competence in his old age an alarming notion if true more cautiously than hed spoken before molotov asked when will your country have its own explosivemetal bombs we cannot very well coordinate our strategy if we do not know when that strategy becomes effective jaribbentrop said not very happily he paced up and down along the deck his interpreter an obsequious half pace behind and to his left at last he saidgott mit uns we shall have our first bomb next spring with others following quickly on its heels what of soviet russia when will you be ready to give the lizards another dose of their own medicine our timetable is tightly similar to yours molotov answered for years he had trained himself to reveal nothing with his face with his voice with his stance that training served him in good stead now the soviet program would not produce a bomb of its own next spring and probably not for a couple of years thereafter molotov wished he could pace what to do what to do if ribbentrop was telling the truth the nazis had not only recovered from the disaster their nuclear program had suffered but were also ready to produce their own explosive metal in large amounts what to do ribbentrop had let slip that the heart of the german effort lay somewhere not far from the rhine word ever so discreetly leaked to the lizards would mean theyand the soviet unionmight be freed of the threat of explosivemetal bombs in the hands of a madman like hitler but the nazis were also putting up a stubborn resistance against the lizards if they collapsed under a cloud of nuclear fire the imperialist aggressors from the stars would be able to turn more force on the peaceloving people of the soviet union they were already giving signs of realizing the ussr was not in a position to deploy more nuclear weapons against them keeping germany in the fight might keep the soviet union alive too it was a delicate calculation molotov knew the final decision would not be his only stalin would make it stalins cult of personality maintained that the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union was never wrong molotov knew better but this time stalin had to be right nieh hoting maneuvered his pedicab through the streets of peking he swerved to avoid a horsedrawn wagon then again to keep from being run down by a lorry full of lizards with guns he wished he could fling a grenade into the back of the truck but no not now if you couldnt be patient you didnt deserve to win men on foot got out of the way for nieh when they didnt move fast enough to suit him he screamed at them move you stupid woodenheaded sons of a turtle mother the men he abused shouted insults back at him they also grinned and waved as did he it was all good fun and helped pass the time nieh did not swear at men afoot who were dressed in westernstyle clothes instead he called out to them in beseeching tones ride noble sir sometimes he varied that by using the little scaly devils phrasing ride superior sir other pedicab drivers also loudly solicited the little devils running dogs so did rickshaw men who toiled between the shafts of their carts like bullocks anyone rich enough to dress like a foreign devil was also rich enough to pay for a ride little scaly devils patrolled the streets on foot no one asked them if they wanted a ride people knew better the scaly devils skittered along in squadsized packs they didnt go out in peking by ones and twos they knew better ride superior sirs nieh hoting called to a couple of men in white shirts and ties who walked along with jackets slung over their shoulders they looked tired the poor running dogs they climbed into the back of the pedicab take us to thechi nien tien one of them said go fast too we need to be there quickly yes sir nieh hoting started to pedal the hall of annual prayers it is you pay me five dollars mex all right stop the cab we will get out the man answered we do not need to ride with a thief if you asked for two dollars mex that would still be too much nieh slowed down but did not stop if i let you out gentlemen you will be late on your important journey suppose you give me four mex fifty i suppose if i am stingy my wife and children will not starve on that fare do you hear the gall of this man one of the scaly devils henchmen said to the other he talks of his wife and children but thinks nothing of ours who will suffer if we meet his extortionate demands anyone who expects to get more than three dollars mex for such a short journey would surely steal coppers from a blind beggar rich men who refuse to share their bountysomething dreadful will surely happen to them in the next life if not in this one nieh said even four mex twentyfive would not be altogether without virtue they finally settled on three mex dollars seventyfive cents by which time theyd nearly reached the hall of annual prayers nieh scorned the running dogs as inept hagglers anything over three dollars mex was too much to pay for that ride when he worked as a pedicab driver hebecame a pedicab driver anything else anything less was dangerous the two lackeys of the scaly devils paid him alighted and headed off toward the tall circular building with its domed triple roof of blue tiles nieh slowly pedaled away every now and then jingling a brass bell to try to lure in another fare he soon did a wornlooking woman with a straw basket filled to overflowing with chicken feet rooster combs giblets and other bits of meat no one who could afford better would want she told him to go to a little cookshop in one of pekings innumerablehutungs not to a fancy public building your load there will make many tasty soups nieh said the woman nodded he hardly haggled with her at all solidarity between proletarians came ahead of desire for profit she noticed his generosity and smiled at him he took note of where her eatery was the party needed all the friends it could find and all the hiding places too he pedaled back out onto the bigger streets jangling his bell he felt dispirited those two men in western clothes should have sent him where he wanted to go if worse came to worst he might have to head for thepan tao kung without anyone in his pedicab going to the spiral peach palace with an empty pedicab was risky though he would be remarked upon but how long could he wait for just the right fare patience he said out loud reminding himself the revolution was built one small step at a time if anyone tried to rush it it would fail he picked up another meaningless fare won the haggle without effort and took the man where he wanted to go back and forth across the city nieh pedaled sweat soaked through his black cotton tunic and ran down his face from under the straw hat that shielded him from the merciless sun that sun slid steadily across the sky soon it would be evening and time for nieh hoting to go back to his lodging till morning came again for a whole cadre of reasons nieh did not want to do that you driver a fat man shouted imperiously anyone fat in peking these days surely trafficked with the little scaly devils nieh zoomed toward him cutting off another fellow with a pedicab whom he might also have been calling where to superior sir he asked as the man climbed in thepan tao kung the fat man answered springs creaked under him as his large heavy fundament pressed down on the seat do you know where that is yesjust south of the eastern wicket gate nieh answered i can take you there for five dollars mex go the fat man waved disdaining even to dicker his pudgy face puffed out farther with pride i am to meet with the little scaly devils in the spiral peach palace to show how my factory can work for them eeeyou must be a very powerful man nieh said pedaling harder i will get you there safe never fear he raised his voice move you sluggards i have here a man who cannot waste the day behind him his passenger shifted smugly on the padded seat enjoying the face he gained by having his importance publicly proclaimed traffic did not vanish for niehs pedicab as he rolled east downhua erh shih flower market street he hadnt expected it would most of the people on the street would have sworn at niehs passenger had they dared and desisted only for fear he might have been important enough to get them in trouble if he wanted some went out of their way to obstruct niehs progress in their sandals he would have done the same along with the artificial flowers that gave it its name flower market street also boasted a number of shops that sold cheap costume jewelry hsia shoutao probably would have loved the area for a great many pretty women frequented it nieh hoting frowned hsia was politically progressive but he remained socially exploitive the two should not have coexisted in the same man nieh hoting turned north offhua erh shih toward the spiral peach palace it was not a prepossessing building having only two small rooms but it was the headquarters of the little scaly devils in charge of turning the output of human factories to their own advantage nieh steered the pedicab right up to the entranceway of the spiral peach palace a scaly devil stood guard outside it niehs passenger dropped five silver mex dollars into his hand got down from the pedicab and strutted over to the guard he showed him a card and gained entrance to the palace after reaching down to the frame of the pedicab as if to adjust the chain nieh also went over to the guard you watch my cab hey he said in slow chinese he pointed across the street to a couple of men selling noodles and pork and fish from two big pots i go over get some food come back all right all right you go the guard said you come back fast oh yes of course i will superior sir nieh answered speaking faster now that he saw the guard understood him several people crowded round the noodlesellers for late lunch early supper or afternoon snack as soon as he got into the crowd nieh let his hat fall onto the back of his neck the string under his chin held it in place there even that small change in his appearance should have been plenty to confuse the guard about exactly who he was he asked the noodlesellers their prices exclaimed in horror at the answer he got and departed he did not go back to reclaim the pedicab instead he ducked into the first narrow littlehutung he came upon he took the first chance he got to doff the straw hat and throw it away all the while he rapidly walked south and east turning corners every chance he got the more distance he put between himself and the spiral peach palace blameven though hed gone better than a half ali the blast was plenty to stagger him men shouted women shrieked in alarm nieh looked back over his shoulder a very satisfactorily thick cloud of smoke and dust was rising from the direction of the spiral peach palace he and his comrades had loaded more than fifty kilos of high explosive and a timer under the seat of the pedicab and in the steel tubing of the frame the blast had surely killed the sentry with luck it had knocked down the palace and disposed of the little scaly devils who exploited mankind for their own advantage the little devils needed to remember not every man could be made into a running dog or a traitor he came out on a street big enough to have pedicabs on it and hailed one for the journey back to his lodging house in the western part of the city he haggled with the driver for forms sake but yielded sooner than he might have had his heart been in the dicker he knew just how hard the gaunt fellow was working for his coins teerts sat worn and depressed in the debriefing room at the races air base in southern france he spoke into a recorder on this mission i shelled and bombed targets on the island known by the big ugly name of britain i returned to base with minimal damage to my aircraft and inflicted substantial damage on tosevite males and materiel elifrim the base commandant asked did you encounter any tosevite aircraft during your support mission over britain superior sir we did teerts answered our radar identified several big ugly killercraft circling at what is for them extreme high altitude as they were limited to visual search they spotted neither us nor our missiles and were shot down without even having the opportunity to take evasive action later at lower altitude we met more skilled tosevite raiders because we had exhausted our missiles we had to engage them with cannon fire pilot vemmen in my flight did have his killercraft badly damaged while i am told two other males in different flights were shot down elifrim sighed heavily these tosevite aircraft at high altitudes they were merely circling they did not seek to dive on you no superior sir teerts said as i say we knocked them down before they knew we were in the vicinity i admit it did strike me as a little odd most british pilots are more alert the ones who attacked us at low altitude certainly were we had to fly slowly then to enhance the accuracy of weapons delivery and were only a little faster than their machines and frankly not as maneuverable that was a difficult encounter your reports of losses in it are correct elifrim said it was made more difficult by the fact that you had expended your antiaircraft missiles was it not yes certainly teerts said but the commandant overrode him but nothing flight leader teerts over the past several days our forces on the ground in britain have recovered wreckage from some of these highaltitude circlers it is their opinion that these aircraft were never piloted that some sort of automatic device flew them to altitude and set them circling as diversionary targets with the deliberate intent of inciting our males to expend missiles without bagging skilled tosevite pilots in exchange teerts stared at him thatsone of the most underhanded things ive ever heard he said slowly superior sir we cannot afford to ignore aircraft circling above us if they are not bluffs such as the one you describe they dive on us and have the potential to hurt us badly i am painfully aware of this elifrim said and i have no good solution to offer the british have concludedand it is a conclusion that strikes me as reasonablethat one of their aircraft if not piloted is worth exchanging for one of our missiles they can produce aircraft faster and more cheaply than we can manufacture missiles and by making us use missiles early and on the wrong targets they improve their pilots chances of survival in subsequent encounters truth teerts also sighed after my experiences no tosevite perfidy should much surprise me no tosevite perfidy should surprise any of us the commandant agreed i am given to understand that no more missions will be flown in support of the northern pocket in britain i see teerts said slowly he did too and didnt like what he saw the race had lost that battle before long he feared no flights would be going into the southern pocket of britain either that one wasnt shrinking but it wasnt getting any bigger either resupply by air let it hold its own but the cost there was high not just in the males on the ground but in the irreplaceable males and aircraft without which the infantry and armor could not long function dismissed flight leader teerts the commandant said teerts left the debriefing room another wornlooking pilot his body paint smudged went in to take his place teerts headed for the door that led outside after his interrogations at the hands of the nipponese debriefing by an officer of his own kind was so mild as to be hardly worth noticing elifrim hadnt kicked him or slapped him or threatened him with hot things or sharp and pointed things or things that were hot and sharp and pointed or even screamed that he was a liar and would suffer for his lies what kind of questioning was that supposed to be tosev shone down brightly on this part of its third world the weather struck teerts as about halfway between crisp and mildbetter than it was most of the time over most of the planet tosev might not have been such a bad place if it werent for the tosevites thanks to them though the race was fighting not just for victory here but for survival thanks to them most of the males whod flown into britain with such high hopes of knocking a foe out of the war would fly out wounded or wrapped in plastic for final disposalor would never fly out at all with a deliberate effort of will teerts made himself not think about the fiasco britain had become but when his eye turrets swiveled in his head to let him look over the air base he found nothing to cheer him here either when the race first came to tosev it had let its aircraft rest openly on their strips confident the big uglies could not reach them now teerts killercraft like those of his comradesby the emperor like those of the big uglies huddled in earthen revetments antiaircraftmissile emplacements still ringed the base but they were short of missilesa good thing the big uglies dont know how short we are teerts thought sooner or later though theyd find out they had a knack for that theyd spent so much time and effort spying on one another that low technology or not they found ways to figure out what the race was doing to try to make up for the missile shortage technicians had slaved francais antiaircraft cannon to radars provided by the race that made the guns far more accurate than theyd been before but still left them without either the range or the killing power the missiles had had and the big uglies would eventually notice the cannons and worse figure out why they were emplaced when they did the revetments would start paying for themselves the debriefing room lay not far from the edge of the air base teerts watched a couple of tosevites shambling along the road that passed by the base even by the low standards the big uglies set for themselves these were travelworn specimens their clothes even they needed protection against their home planets wretched weather dirty and stained their hides grimy one of them the bigger one must have seen war or other misfortune somewhere for a long scar furrowed one side of his face in teerts mind that just made the big ugly uglier plastic surgery techniques on tosev were as backwards as the other arts on the planet which struck teerts as a shame since tosev offered the unwary so many chances to maim and disfigure themselves the race was used to machines and systems that always worked and never hurt anybody the big uglies just wanted results and didnt much care how they got them teerts understood that better than he would have before he came to tosev or to be specific before the nipponese captured him he felt the same restless craving for ginger as the big uglies did for everything in their lives he wanted a taste he wanted it now and as long as he got it nothing else mattered to him getting it wasnt hard either many of the groundcrew males had been here since the race seized the air base theyd had plenty of time to make connections with tosevites who could supply what they needed teerts had feared only the nipponese knew about the herb to which theyd addicted him but it seemed almost weedcommon all over tosev and to the big uglies it was nothing more than a condiment teerts mouth fell open what irony the tosevites were biologically incapable of appreciating far and away the best thing their miserable planet produced he spied a fuel specialist and stepped out into the males path how may i help you superior sir the specialist asked his words were all they should have been but his tone was knowing cynical my engines could use a cleaning additive i think teerts answered the code was clumsy but worked well enough that by all accounts no one here had got in trouble for using ginger there were horror stories of whole bases closed down and personnel sent to punishment when gingerusers got caught those who caught them were disinclined to mercy think youve got some contaminants in your hydrogen line do you superior sir the specialist asked well computer analysis should be able to tell whether youre right or wrong come with me well check it out the terminal to which the fuel specialist led teerts was networked to all the others at the air base and to a mainframe in one of the starships that had landed in southern france the code the specialist punched into it had nothing to do with fuel analysis it went somewhere into the accounting section of the mainframe how far out of spec are your engines performing the male asked at least thirty percent teerts answered he keyed the figure into the computer it unobtrusively arranged for him to transfer thirty percent of his last pay periods income to the fuel specialists account no one had ever asked questions about such transactions not at this air base teerts suspected that meant a real live male in the accounting department was suppressing fund transfer data to make sure no one asked questions he wondered whether the male got paid off in money or in ginger he knew which he would rather have had there you are superior sir see analysis shows your problems not too serious the fuel specialist said continuing the charade but heres your additive just in case he shut down the terminal reached into a pouch on his belt and passed teerts several small plastic vials filled with brownish powder ah thank you very much teerts stowed them in one of his own pouches as soon as he got some privacy this cold wet mudball of a planet would have the chance to redeem itself walking with friedrich through the streets of lodz made mordechai anielewicz feel he was walking alongside a beast of prey that had developed a taste for human flesh and might turn on him at any moment the comparison wasnt altogether accurate but it wasnt altogether wrong either he didnt know what friedrich had done in the war or in the time between the german conquest of poland and the invasion of the lizards whatever hed done friedrich had sense enough to keep his mouth shut now even with jews swarming all about him the lodz ghetto wasnt as large as warsaws but it was just as crowded and just as hungry next to what the ghettos had endured in nazi times what they had now was abundance next to abundance what they had now wasnt much anielewicz scowled at the posters of mordechai chaim rumkowski that stared down from every blank wall in the ghetto some of the posters were old and faded and peeling others looked to have been put up yesterday rumkowski had run things here under the nazis and by all appearances was still running them under the lizards mordechai wondered how exactly hed managed that friedrich noticed the posters too give that old bastard hair and a little mustache and he could be hitler he remarked glancing slyly over at anielewicz how does that make you feel shmuel even now surrounded by jews he didnt leave off his baiting neither did anielewicz it wasnt particularly vicious it was the sort of teasing two workmen who favored rival football clubs might have exchanged sick mordechai answered that was true for before the war hed never imagined the jews could produce their own vestpocket hitlers but he wouldnt give friedrich the pleasure of knowing he was irked so he added hitlers a much uglier man as far as he was concerned that was so both literally and metaphorically ah rubbish friedrich said planting a playful elbow in his ribs one of these days the nazi would do that once too often and then something dramatic would happen he hadnt done it quite often enough for that not yet something dramatic happened anyhow a jew in a cloth cap and a long black coat stopped in the middle of lutomierska street and stared at friedrich the jew had a wide ugly scar across the right side of his face as if a bullet had creased him there he walked up to anielewicz waggled a forefinger in front of his nose are you a jew he demanded in yiddish yes im a jew mordechai answered in the same language he understood why the newcomer sounded a little uncertain even with the light brown beard on his cheeks he looked more like a pole than the swarthy hooknosed stereotype of a jew youare a jew the newcomer clapped a hand to his forehead almost knocking the cap from his head he pointed at friedrich do you know whom youre walking with do you knowwhat youre walking with his hand quivered i know that if theres a fire the engine is going to come out of there and smash us flat as a couple oflatkes anielewicz answered nodding over toward the fire station in front of which they stood the ghetto fire engine still had petrol as far as he knew it was the only vehicle in the jewish quarter of lodz that did he gently took the jew by the elbow come on lets go over on the sidewalk he gathered in friedrich with his eyes you come too where else would i go friedrich said his voice easy amused it was not an idle question a lot of the young men on the street had rifles slung over their shoulders if he ran a shout of nazi would surely get him caught and likely get him shot the jew with the scarred cheek seemed ready to give that shout too his features working he repeated do you know what youre walking with you who say you are a jew yes i know hes a german mordechai answered we were in a partisan band together he may have been a nazi soldier but hes a good fighting man hes given the lizards many a kick in the arse with a german you might be a friend with a nazi even you might be a friend the jew answered the world is a strange place that i should say such a thing but with a murderer of his kind he spat at friedrichs feet i said i was his comrade i did not say i was his friend anielewicz replied the distinction sounded picayune even to him he stared at friedrich with a sudden horrid suspicion a lot of men in the partisan band had been reticent about just what theyd done before they joined it hed been reticent himself when you got down to it but a german could have some particularly good reasons for wanting to keep his mouth shut his comrade now the jew spat between mordechais feet listen to mecomrade he freighted the word with the hate and scorn a biblical prophet might have used my name is pinchas silberman i ami wasa greengrocer in lipno unless you are from there you would never have heard of it it is a little town north of here it had a few jewsfifty maybe not a hundred we got on well enough with our polish neighbors silberman paused to glare at friedrich one day after the germans conquered poland in came aplatoon is that what you call it of a police battalion they gathered us up men and women and childrenme my yetta aaron yossel and little goldaand they marched us into the woods he your precious comrade he was one of them i shall take his face to the grave with me were you ever in lipno anielewicz asked friedrich i dont know the german answered indifferently ive been in a lot of little polish towns silbermans voice went shrill hear the angel of death ive been in a lot of little polish towns he says no doubt he was and left not a jew alive behind him except by accident me i was an accident he shot my wife he shot my daughter in her arms he shot my boys and then he shot me i had a great bloody head woundhe brought a hand up to his faceso he and the rest of the murderers must have thought i was dead along with my family along with all the others they went away i got up and i walked to plock which is a bigger town not far from lipno i was half healed before the germans emptied out plock they didnt shoot everyone there some the ablebodied they shipped here to lodz to workto slavefor them i was one of those now god is kind and i can have my revenge policebattalion anielewicz stared at friedrich with undisguised loathing the german had always acted like a soldier hed fought as well as any soldier and anielewicz had assumed hed been awehrmacht man that was bad enough but hed heard of and even known a few decentwehrmacht men even before the lizards came a lot of them were soldiers like any other countrys just doing their jobs but the men in the police battalions the most you could give them was that they didnt always kill all the jews in the towns and villages they visited as silberman had said some they drafted into slave labor instead and hed fought beside friedrich slept beside him shared food with him escaped from the prison camp with him he felt sick what can you say for yourself he demanded because hed done all those things with friedrichand because he was in part alive thanks to the germanhe hesitated to shout for one of those armed jews right away he was willing at least to hear how the german defended himself friedrich shrugged shall i tell you im sorry would it do me any good he shrugged again he hadnt intended that second question to be taken seriously after a moment he went on im not particularly sorry i did what my officers told me to do they said you jews were enemies of thereich and needed eliminating just like our other enemies and so yet another shrug anielewicz had heard that same argument from nazis the jews had captured when they helped the lizards drive the germans out of warsaw before he could say anything pinchas silberman hissed my yetta my boys my babythese were enemies they were going to hurt you nazi bastards he tried to spit in friedrichs face but missed the spittle slid slowly down the brick wall of the fire station answer him anielewicz barked when friedrich kept silent for a moment jawohl herr generalfeldmarschallfriedrich said clicking his heels with exquisite irony you have me you will do as you like with me just as i did as i liked before when england dropped bombs on us and blew up our women and children they thought those women and children were enemies and before you start shouting at me when we dropped bombs on the english we did the same thingja how does that make me any different from a bomber except i did it retail with a rifle instead of wholesale with a bombing plane but the jews you murdered had never done anything to you mordechai said hed run into that peculiar german blind spot before too parts of poland used to be germany and some of the jews here fought for the kaiser in the last war what kind of sense does it make to go slaughtering them now my officers said they were enemies if i hadnt treated them as enemies who knows what would have happened to me friedrich said and let me ask you another question shmuelif you could make a giant omelet out of all the lizards eggs would you do it so theyd never trouble us again a nazitzaddik we dont need silberman said answer me this nazischmuck what would you do if you found the man whod killed your wife and children what would you do if you found himand he didnt even remember doing it id kill the motherfucker friedrich answered but im just a nazi bastard so what the devil do i know silberman looked at mordechai out of his own mouth you heard it he puts the noose around his neckand if he didnt i would friedrich looked at him too as if to saywe fought together and now youre going to kill me you already knew part of what i was a long time ago how much were you pretending so we didnt go for each others throats anielewicz sighed friedrich i think wed better go over to the balut market square the square didnt hold the market alone the administration offices for the lodz ghetto were there too some of the jewish fighting men there would know mordechai was not shmuel a simple partisan with some of those who knew who he really was that would work to his advantage others though might be inclined to reveal his true name to chaim rumkowskior to the lizards so youre going to tell them to hang me too eh friedrich said no anielewicz said slowly pinchas silberman let out an outraged howl ignoring it mordechai went on silberman here will tell what you did before the lizards came ill tell what youve done since or what i know of it it should tilt the balance toward friedrich laughed in his face you jews took it when you were on the bottom you think i believe you wont give it now that youre on top we believe in something you nazis never heard of anielewicz answered its called justice its calledscheisse is what its called friedrich said so in the name of justice youre going to in the middle of the sentence without shifting either his eyes or his feet to give warning he hit anielewicz in the belly and ran oof mordechai said and folded up like a concertinashlemiel he thought as he gasped for air his lungs didnt want to give him friedrich might have started out in a police battalion but hed picked up a real soldiers skills from somewhereand a partisans as well not letting your foe know what you were about to do until you did it ranked high on both lists but the german who knew anielewicz was dangerous had not reckoned that pinchas silberman might be too the jew from lipno dashed after him screaming nazi murderer at the top of his lungs anielewicz made it up to his knees just in time to see silberman spring on friedrichs back they went down in a thrashing heap that was a fight in which silberman was bound to get the worse of it and quickly but friedrich hadnt beaten and kicked him into unconsciousness before a couple of mausercarrying jewish fighting men put an end to the scrap with peremptory orders silberman gasped out his story one of the fighting men asked friedrich a oneword questionnu friedrich gave a oneword answerja two rifles barked almost in the same instant the gunshots made men who didnt know what was going on cry out a couple of women screamed pinchas silberman burst into tears joy rage sadness that yet another death didnt bring back his slaughtered family anielewicz wondered if he knew himself one of the jewish fighters said to the other come on aaron lets get rid of this garbage they dragged friedrich away by the heels his body left a trail of blood on lutomierska street mordechai slowly got to his feet he still bent at the midsection friedrich was strong as a mule and had hit the way a mule kicked too hed been a pretty good companion but when you set what hed done before against thatanielewicz shook his head the german had probably deserved to die but if all the people who deserved to die on account of what theyd done in the war dropped dead at once thered be hardly more people left alive than after noahs flood the world would belong to the lizards he shook his head again the lizards didnt have clean hands either he started slowly and painfully down the street he was altogether on his own again one way or another though he expected hed manage to make a nuisance of himself god i pity the poor infantry heinrich jager said putting one foot in front of the other with dogged persistence if i havent lost ten kilos on this blasted hike its a miracle oh quit moaning otto skorzeny said youre in the south of france my friend one of the prime holiday spots in all the world yes and now you can ask me if i give a damn too jager said when youre marching across it it might as well be the russian steppe its just about as hot as the steppe was in summer thats certain he wiped the sleeve of his shirt over his face he wore a workmans outfit none too clean it wouldnt fool a frenchman into thinking he was french but it had done well enough with the lizards its not as cold as the steppe in winter and thats a fact skorzeny shivered melodramatically its not as ugly either now shake a leg we want to get to the next safe house before the sun goes down he lengthened his already long stride sighing jager kept up were you in such a tearing hurry that you had to march us straight past that lizard air base the other day he grumbled we got by with it so quit your bellyaching skorzeny said the bold line is always the way to go when you mess with those scaly bastards theyre so cautious and calculating they never look for anybody to try something risky and outrageous they wouldnt be that stupid themselves so they dont expect anyone else to be either weve taken advantage of it more than once too all very well but one of these days youre going to stick yourschwantz on the chopping block and i dont fancy having mine there beside it jager said why not how much use are you getting out of it now skorzeny asked laughing he turned back toward the air base and did you see the popeyed stare that one pilot gave us as best he could he imitated a lizards swiveling eyes jager laughed too in spite of himself then he sobered how could you tell the lizard was a pilot gold and blue bands on his chest and belly yellow on the arms and those red and purple squiggles on his head hes mediumsenior id sayotherwise hed have fewer of the purple ones ive been studying their paint for a long time my friend if i say something along those lines is so you can take it to the bank oh i will jager said with some irony but not much they trudged on to their right the river tarn chuckled in its banks sheep and cattle pulled up grass and shrubs in the fields every so often a dog barked a hammer rang on an anvil in a blacksmiths shop in a tiny village just as it might have done a thousand years before ill tell you what i like about this countryside jager said suddenly its the first ive seen in the past four years that hasnt been fought over to a faretheewell aber naturlichskorzeny answered and when we find a cafe you can order yourself some vichyssoise too vichyssoise jager said and then a moment too late ohja the french gave up before we got down here and this part of france wasnt occupied then the lizards came and they gave up to them too theyre good at it he grunted and a whole lot of them are alive now who would be dead if theyd fought more does that make them cowards or just smarter than we are both skorzeny answered me though id rather stand up on my hind legs and not lie down till somebody knocks me overand ill try and kick the feet out from under him as im falling too jager thought that over he slowly nodded a bell sounded behind him he stepped aside to let a french policeman on a bicycle roll past with his kepi and little dark mustache the fellow looked like a cinema frenchman in the carrying basket under the handlebars he had a couple of long skinny loaves of bread and a bottle of red wine perhaps his mind was more on them than on anything else for he rode by the germans without a second glance they strode past the little hamlet of ambialet a long time ago a lord had built a castle on a crag that stuck out into the tarn later a church and a monastery sprang up close by they were all ruins now but the hamlet remained not far beyond it they came to a farmhouse screened off from the road by a stand of willows ducks quacked in a pond close by from off in a barn a pig grunted a stocky stoopshouldered frenchman in a straw hat that almost made him look american put down the bucket he was carrying when the two germans approached bonjour monsieurjager said in his halting heavily accented frenchavezvous une cigarette peutetre deux i regretmonsieur that i have not even one let alone two the farmers shrug was so perfectly gallic that jager forgot about the straw hat the fellow went on you will be from uncle henri ouijager said completing the recognition phrase he didnt know who uncle henri was perhaps a frenchified version of heinrich himmler come in both of you the farmer said waving toward the building my wife and daughter they are staying with my brotherinlaw down the road for a few days they do not know why but they are glad to visit rene for a time he paused you may call me jacques by the way that didnt necessarily mean his name was jacques jager noted nonetheless he saidmerci jacques i am jean and this is francois skorzeny snickered at the alias hed been given francois was a name for a fussy headwaiter not a scarfaced fighting man jacques eyes had heavy lids and dark pouches under them they were keen all the same you would be johann and fritz then he said in german a little better than jagers french if you like skorzeny answered in the same language jacques smile did not quite reach those eyes he too knew aliases when he heard them the interior of the farmhouse was gloomy even after jacques switched on the electric lamps again jager reminded himself no one had fought a war in this part of france for generations the amenities that had been here before were still likely to work jacques said you will be hungry yes marie left a stew i am to reheat for us he got a fire going in the hearth and hung a kettle above it before long a delicious aroma filled the farmhouse jacques poured white wine from a large jug into three mismatched glasses he raised his for the lizardsmerde they all drank the wine was sharp and dry jager wondered if it would tan his tongue to leather inside his mouth then jacques ladled out the stew carrots onions potatoes and bits of meat in a gravy savory with spices jager all but inhaled his plateful yet skorzeny finished ahead of him when drunk alongside the stew the wine was fine marvelous jager glanced over at jacques if you eat this well all the time its a wonder you dont weigh two hundred kilos farming is never easy the frenchman answered and it has grown only harder these past few years with no petrol at hand a farmer can eat yes but he works off his food what kind of meat is it skorzeny asked looking wistfully back toward the kettle wild rabbit jacques spread his hands you must know how it ismessieurs the livestock it is too precious to slaughter except to keep from starving orpeutetre for a great feast like a wedding but i am a handy man with a snare and so he spread his workgnarled hands he made no move to offer skorzeny more stew and even the brash ss man did not get up to refill his plate uninvited like jager he likely guessed jacques would need what was left to feed himself after the two of them had moved on jager said thank you for putting us up here for the night pas de quoijacques answered his hand started to come up to his mouth as if with a cigarette jager had seen a lot of people make gestures like that this past year after a moment the frenchman resumed life is strangenestce pas when i was a young man i fought youboches you germans at verdun and never did i think we could be allies your people and mine marshal petain also fought at verdun skorzeny said and he has worked closely with the german authorities jager wondered how jacques would take that some frenchmen thought well of petain while to others he was a symbol of surrender and collaboration jacques only shrugged and said it is late i will get your blankets he took for granted that soldiers would have no trouble sleeping on the floor at the moment jager would have had no trouble sleeping on a bed of nails the blankets were rough scratchy wool the one jager wrapped around himself smelled of a womans sweat and faintly of rose water he wondered whether it belonged to jacques wife or his daughter and knew he couldnt ask skorzeny had already started snoring jager lay awake a while trying to remember how long it had been since hed lain with a woman occasional visits to a brothel didnt really count except to relieve pressure like the safety valve of a steam engine the last one that mattered had been ludmila gorbunova he sighedmost of a year now too long breakfast the next morning was slabs of bread cut from a long thin loaf like those the policeman had carried in his bicycle basket jager and skorzeny washed the bread down with more white wine you might prefer coffee i know jacques said but his gallic shrug was eloquent by me wine is plenty good skorzeny said jager wasnt so sure he agreed he didnt make a habit of drinking part of his breakfast and suspected the wine would leave him logy and slow skorzeny picked up the loaf from which jacques had taken slices well finish this off for lunch if you dont mind his tone said jacques had better not mind the frenchman shrugged again jager would have taken the bread too but he would have been more circumspect about how he did it circumspection however did not seem to be part of skorzenys repertoire to smooth things over jager asked how far to albi jacques twenty kilometers perhaps twentyfive the farmer answered indifferently jager projected a mental map of the territory inside his head the answer sounded about right a good days hike especially for a man who was used to letting panzers haul him around the sun beat at the back of his neck and skorzenys when they set out sweat started running down his cheeks almost at oncethe wine he thought annoyed but it was not just the wine the air hung thick and breathless he had to push through it as if through gauze to move ahead when the sun rose higher in the sky the day would be savagely hot a stream of lizard lorries came up the road toward jager and skorzeny they scrambled off onto the verge what were a couple of human beings dead by the side of the road to the lizards he kicked at the tarmac if a couple of russian civilians hadnt gotten out of the way of a german motor convoy what would have happened to them probably the same thing skorzeny hadnt been thinking about civilians of any sort he said you know what theyre hauling in those lorries if it isnt gas masks one of us will be the most surprised man in france and the other will be runnerup jager answered how right you are skorzeny said chuckling our job is to make sure they dont keep shipping them out of there in such great lots he sounded as if that posed no more problems than hiking along this all but deserted road maybe he even believed it after his coupsplaying prometheus by stealing explosive metal from the lizards absconding with mussolini from right under their snouts doing the same with a lizard panzer and driving the aliens out of split and out of all of croatiahe had a right to be confident there was however a difference between confidence and arrogance jager thought so anyhow skorzeny might have had other ideas they rested for a while in the heat of midday going down to the banks of the tarn to drink some water and to splash some on their faces then under the shade of a spreading oak they shared the bread skorzeny had appropriated from jacques a kingfisher dove into the river with a splash somewhere back in the brush a beeeater took off with a cry ofquilp quilp i should have lifted some of that wine too skorzeny said god only knows how many frenchmen have been pissing in this river or what were liable to catch from drinking out of it i used to worry about that too jager answered i still do but not so much do it often enough and you stop thinking about it he shook his head like you stop thinking about killing people but on a smaller scale if you know what i mean skorzenys big head bobbed up and down i like that its true too no doubt about it cautiously jager said like killing jews too dont you think skorzeny the more you do the easier it gets there were just the two of them here in the quiet of southern france if you couldnt speak your mind or at least part of it here where could you and if you couldnt speak your mind anywhere was life really worth living were you a man or just a mindless machine dont start in on me about that skorzeny said now he tossed his head like a man shaking flies i didnt have anything to do with it i fought alongside those jews in russia remember same as you did when we raided the lizards for their explosive metal i remember jager said i dont have anything to do with he stopped how many of the prisoners extracting uranium from the failed nuclear pile outside hechingen and bringing it to schloss hohentubingen had been jews a good many without a doubt he might not have condemned them himself but hed exploited them once they were condemned he tried again when thereichs hands are dirty how can anyones hands be clean they cant skorzeny said placidly war is a filthy business and it dirties everything it touches the whole business with the jews is just part of that christ on his cross jager are you going to feel clean after we give albi our little dose of joy and good tidings thats different jager stuck out his chin and looked stubborn the lizards can shoot backthey shoot better than we do but marching the jews up to a pit and shooting them a row at a timeor the camps in poland people will remember that sort of thing for a thousand years who remembers the armenians the turks killed in the last war skorzeny said when theyre gone theyre gone he rubbed his dry palms back and forth as if washing his hands jager couldnt match that callousness even if you were right iam right skorzeny broke in who worries about the carthaginians these days or for that matter about thewhats the right name for themherr doktor professor of archaeology the albigensians thats it from the town just ahead even if you were right jager repeated they arent all gone and they wont be all gone not with the lizards holding poland and those ones who are left will see to it that our name stays black forever if we win the war it doesnt matter and if we lose the war it doesnt matter either skorzeny climbed to his feet come on well get into albi by sundown and then its just a matter of waiting for our toys to arrive that closed out the possibility of more talk jager also got upi shouldnt have expected anything else he told himself most german officers wouldnt talk about jews at all in a way skorzenys candor was an improvement but only in a way sighing jager tramped on toward albi liu han felt invisible with a wicker basket in hand she could wander from one of pekings markets to the next without being noticed she was just one more woman among thousands maybe millions no one paid the least attention to her any more than you paid attention to one particular flea among the many on a dogs back think of yourself as a flea nieh hoting had told her you may be tiny but your bite can draw blood liu han was sick to death of being a flea she was sick to death of being invisible shed been invisible all her life she wanted to do something bold and prominent something to make the scaly devils regret theyd ever interfered with her of course the one time shed not been invisible was when shed been in the little devils clutches she prayed to the amida buddha and any other god or spirit who would listen that she never attain such visibility again bok choivery fresh a merchant bawled in her ear others hawked barley rice millet wheat poultry pork spicesany sort of food or condiment you could imagine back in another market somebody had been selling canned goods some chinese others made by foreign devils with their foods inside liu hans gorge rose thinking about those the little scaly devils had kept her alive with them while they held her prisoner on the plane that never came down if she tasted them again she would remember that time and she wanted to forget the only good that had come from it was her baby and it was stolen and bobby fiore its father dead shed stayed close to the can salesman for some time though canned goods were scarce in peking these days especially canned goods produced by the foreign devils to show such a stock the fellow who was selling them had to have connections with the little scaly devils maybe they would come around to his stalland if they did she would eavesdrop nieh hoting had told her hed used bobby fiore the same way in shanghai people who could make sense of the scaly devils language were few and far between but the can seller though he might have been what nieh called a running dog was no fool you woman he shouted at liu han do you want to buy something or are you spying on me i am just resting here for a moment sir liu han answered in a small voice i cannot afford your excellent canned goods i fear that was true he asked exorbitant prices for good measure she added i wish i could which was a crashing lie she did not mollify the can seller go rest somewhere else he said shaking his fist i think you are telling lies if i see you again i will set the police on you he was a running dog then the peking police like police in any chinese city were the tools of those in power liu han retreated across the little market square to the edge of ahutung she pointed back at the man who sold cans and screeched see the fool with his nose up the little devils back passage as loud as she could then vanished down the alleyway with a little luck shed have created ill will between the can seller and his neighbors in the market maybe even cost him some customers she couldnt reckon it a victory though because hed driven her away before any scaly devils showed up at his stall she bought someliang kao from a man with a basket of themrice cakes stuffed with mashed beans and peas and served with sweet syrupate them and then left thehutungs for pekings more prominent avenues the scaly devils did not usually venture into the lanes and alleys of the city if she wanted to find out what they were doing she would have to go where they were sure enough when she came out on theta cha la the street of large gateposts she found scaly devils aplenty she was not surprised the street was full of fancy silk shops and led to neighborhoods where fine eateries abounded but the scaly devils bought no silks and sought no restaurants instead they gathered several deep around a mountebank whose show might have enlivened a childs birthday party see how fat my mules are and how warm my carriages the fellow cried because the little devils were so short liu han was able to see over them to the folding table the fellow had set up his carriages were about six inches long made of castoff bits of cardboard and used thin sticks for axles the little scaly devils hissed with excitement as he pulled out a tin can from the box that held his paraphernalia out of the can he took one large black dung beetle after another he deftly fastened them to the carriages with reins of thread they pulled those carriagessome of which resembled oldfashioned mule carts others peking water wagonsaround and around the tabletop every so often he had to use a forefinger to keep his steeds from falling off the edge even in the village where liu han had grown up a beetlecart show was nothing out of the ordinary by the way the scaly devils reacted though theyd never seen anything like it in their lives some of them let their mouths hang open in mirth while others nudged each other and exclaimed over the spectacle they make even pests into beasts of burden one of the little devils said see that one has upset the cart look at its little legs wave as it lies on its back another replied he tossed a dollar mex and then another to the mountebank his comrades also showered the fellow with silver the little devils paid liu han no attention the only way they would have noticed her was if shed got in their way while they were watching the antics of the beetles but those antics had so fascinated them they werent talking about anything else after a while liu han decided she wouldnt hear anything worthwhile here theta cha la was full of scaly devils she headed up it toward the next group she saw when she got up to them she discovered they were all staring at a monkey circus going through its paces like most of its kind the circus also included a pekinese dog and a trained sheep both men who ran it clanged brass gongs to draw a bigger crowd growing impatient one of the little scaly devils said you show us these creatures what they donow the two men bowed nervously and obeyed the monkey dressed in a red satin jacket capered about it put on masks one after another cued by more taps on the gong see how it looks like a little tosevite one of the scaly devils said in his own language pointing to the monkey his mouth opened in mirth the little devil beside him said its even uglier than the big uglies i think all that fuzz all over it he shuddered in fastidious disgust i dont know yet another little scaly devil said it has a tail at least i think the big uglies look funny without them liu han pretended she was watching the show without listening to the little devils shed known they had no proper respect for mankindwere that not so they never would have treated her as they had but hearing their scorn grated liu han rocked slowly back and forthyou will pay she thoughtoh how you will pay for all youve done to me but how to make them pay vowing revenge was easy getting it something else again the monkey went through the rest of its turns imitating a wheelbarrow man and a rickshaw puller and then playing on a swing at the top of a bamboo pole the little devils showered the men who ran the monkey circus with coins after the monkey itself came the pekinese it jumped through hoops of different sizes that the men held at varying heights above the ground even in her village liu han had seen dogs that could leap much higher but the little scaly devils admired the pekinese as much as they had the monkey for the finale the sheep came out and the monkey sprang onto its back riding it around in circles like a jockey on a racehorse the little scaly devils had only to look about them to see men on horseback they caught the analogy too and laughed harder than ever when at last the show was over they gave the two men who ran it still more silverthey seemed to have an unlimited supplyand went off in search of further entertainment eeeone of the men said letting mex dollars jingle through his fingers i used to hate the little scaly devils like everyone else but they are making us rich the other animal trainer did not answer he picked up the gong and started pounding on it trying to lure more scaly devils to the next show he had competition a little way up the street a fellow with a horn was playing old familiar tunes he didnt play very well but skill on the trumpet was not how he made his living it was just the traditional signal a fellow who exhibited trained mice used to draw a crowd and sure enough a crowd gathered it had children in it and old people with time on their hands but also a good many little scaly devils because the little devils stood and watched so did liu han hello hello hello the mouse show man boomed jovially he was wearing a square wooden box held on by a shoulder strap from the box rose a wooden pole two feet high on top of which were mounted a pagoda a wooden fish a little hanging bucket made of tin and a hollow wooden peach do you want to see my little friends perform yes the children shouted loud and shrill as a flock of starlings the little scaly devils who understood chinese added their hissing voices to the cries all right then the man said you dont have any cats do you he looked sly if you do kindly keep them in your pockets till were finished he waited till the childrens giggles and the silent laughter of the scaly devils subsided then rapped three times on the side of the box it had a latched hole in the front he lifted the latch four white mice came out and climbed a little ladder of string and sticks of bamboo they went through their paces on the apparatus scrambling down into the bucket and swinging in it pulling the fish up by the string that held it running to the top of the pagoda and jumping inside and scrambling into the peach and peering out whiskers quivering little red eyes aglow the mouse show man said howd you like to bite down and findthat inside your peach the children giggled once more the little scaly devils though did not react to that with mirth one of them said the big uglies have filthy habitsalways parasites in their food truth another said and theyjoke about it they are disgusting a third chimed in but they also manage to be entertaining we dont have beastshows back on home to match these who would have thought animalsespecially tosevite animalscould learn to do so many interesting things i spend as much free time as i can watching them and i said the scaly devil who had spoken second a couple of others sputtered agreement liu han watched the performing mice a minute or two more then she tossed the man who exhibited them a few coppers and walked down theta cha la thinking hard more little devils congregated in a vacant lot from which the wreckage of a shop had been cleared away a trained bear was going through its run of tricks there the scaly devils exclaimed as it wielded a heavy wooden sword with a long handle liu han walked by hardly noticing nieh hoting was always looking for ways to get close to the little scaly devils the better to make their lives miserable if trained animals fascinated them so a troupe of men with such performers might well gain access even to important males or groups of important males anyone who showed nieh a new way to do that would gain credit for it liu han scratched her head she was sure she had a good idea but how could she use it to best advantage she was no longer the naive peasant woman shed been when the little devils carried her away from her village too much had happened to her since if she could she would take her fate back into her own hands not to be a puppet she said a man with a thin wisp of white beard turned and gave her a curious look she didnt care nieh ho ting hadnt treated her badly hed probably treated her better than anyone except bobby fiore but one of the reasons he did treat her so was that he found her a tool to fit his hand if she was lucky if she was careful maybe she could make him treat her as someone to be reckoned with after the lamplit gloom of thekrom george bagnall had to blink and wait for his eyes to adjust to daylight even after the adjustment he looked about curiously something about the quality of the light the color of the sky had changed ever so slightly the day was bright and warm and yet when bagnall remarked on that jerome jones nodded and said i noticed it too the other day somebody up therethe capitals were quite audibleis telling us summer shant last forever he looked wistful now that its beginning to go it seems hardly to have been here at all werent you the blighter who swore to us pskov had a mild climate by russian standards ken embry demanded with mock fierceness this as i recall while we were flying above endless snow and a frozen lake by russian standards pskovdoes have a mild climate jones protested set alongside moscow its very pleasant set along arkhangelsk its like havana or new delhi set alongside arkhangelsk by all accounts the bloody south pole looks like a holiday resort embry said i knew russian standards in matters of weather were elastic before we got here i simply hadnt realized how much stretch the elastic had to it rather like a fat mans underclothes id say that may end up working to our advantage bagnall said the lizards like russian winter even less than we do we should be able to push them farther south of the city a consummation devoutly to be wished ken embry leered at him in aid of which when will they be posting the banns for you and that little russian flier oh give over such nonsense bagnall kicked a clod of dirt down the street nothing is going on between us the other two englishmen snorted either disbelieving or affecting disbelief then jerome jones sighed i wish i thought you were lying that might make tatiana stop throwing her fair white body in your direction weve had rows about it once or twice he kicked moodily at the dirt and embry asked leaving us in suspense that way is bad form and nothing jones answered tatiana does what she bloody well pleases if one were mad enough to try stopping her shed blow off his head neither of the other englishmen thought that was in any way figurative language bagnall said whoever came up with the female of the species is more deadly than the male must have had your fair russian sniper in mind too true jones sighed again he glanced sidelong at bagnall thats why shes keen on you you know she thinks youre better at killing than i amim just a radarman after all the idea makes her motor go bagnall sent him a sympathetic look old chap i dont mean to give offense but have you never wondered if youd be better off without her company oh many a time jones said feelingly well then bagnall asked when the radarman failed to draw the obvious conclusion now jones looked shamefaced for one thing if i give her the boot shes liable to give me something out of the barrel of that snipers rifle of hers he touched a forefinger to a spot just above the bridge of his nose as if to say the bullet would go in there something to that i expect ken embry said but a for one thing generally implies a for another what rather like amen implying ade if youve read your greek like a good fellow nai malistajones said which made all three englishmen laugh bagnall had trouble imagining anything further removed from the classical world than pskov during wartime they walked on for another few steps slowly reluctantly jerome jones continued yes theres a for another the other reason i dont send her packing is thatthati seem to have fallen in love with her he waited for his companions to mock him now it was bagnalls turn to sigh he set a sympathetic hand on jones shoulder the radarman quivered under his touch like a restive horse bagnall said steady there if were being classical lets be downright socratic and define our terms shall we are you truly in love with her or is it just that she pleases you in the kip jerome jones turned a vermilion not commonly seen this side of a sunsethow young he is bagnall thought from his superior altitude of three or four years how does one tell the difference the radarman asked plaintively always a good question embry said with a cynical chuckle lets try answering it then bagnall said for jones looked not only very young but very lost hed meant the question with every fiber of his being bagnall went on socratics we are having another go at thesymposium that pleased jones embry chuckled again and said fair young alcibiades is right out fair young tatiana is quite enough trouble all on her own jones said she and alcibiades theyd deserve each other heres one fast clue to your feelings for starters bagnall said if you only want to have anything to do with your possibly beloved when the two of you are naked between the sheets that should tell you something about your state of mind so it should the radarman looked thoughtful not as simple as that im afraid i wish to heaven it were but i like being around her whether werehe coughedor not its rather like setting up a tent next to a tigers lair you never know what will happen next but its apt to be something exciting and youre liable to end up as thehors doeuvres embry put in bagnall waved the pilot to silence how do you think she feels about you jones he asked jerome jones face furrowed with thought i am of the opinion her fidelity leaves something to be desired he said to which bagnall could but nod jones went on she set her cap for me not the other way round this bloody countryid be afraid to chat up a girl because next thing you know youd be talking to the nkvd instead he shivered some of my university chums they werent just pink they were red if any of them had actually seen russia that wouldnt have lasted long and theres the gods truth youre certain to be right about that bagnall said the same thing has occurred to me oh once or twice during our delightful sojourn here but its not to the point now that centers on the fair tatiana i know jones walked on for several paces without continuing bagnall waited for him to say something anything that would clarify what he felt what tatiana felt and might even help all of them get out of their present complications without falling into new ones that were worse he realized that was asking a lot but hed never wanted tatiana to set her sights on him after a bit the radarman said i chased a lot of skirt back in england i dont think there was a barmaid in any pub i went into whom i didnt try to chat up but we all know theres a deal of difference between chasing it and catching it dont we he chuckled wryly and so when we got here and i had this gorgeous creature chasing me it made me feel about ten feet high and of course he didnt go on but his expression was eloquent ken embry put that expression into words when youre sleeping with a pretty woman there is a certain natural disinclination to do anything which will result in your not sleeping with her in future well yes jones said coloring a little in her own bloodthirsty way i think tatiana is fond enough of me too speaking a bit of russian does me no harm there but she keeps complaining im too soft to quite suit her that shed like me better if i stuck a knife between my teeth and crawled about through the bushes slitting lizards throats bagnall nodded his own rugged masculine charm if any hadnt been what drew tatiana to him he knew that perfectly well tatiana wanted him because she thought he was good at hurting the lizards she hadnt made any bones about it either embry said with that cast of mind its a miracle she didnt throw in her lot with a jerry if she hadnt been trying to pot them before the lizards came she would have done just that my guess is jones said but she hates them worse than any other russian ive ever seen and she thinks her own menfolk are a pack of swine which leftme except nowadays im not good enough either maybe i should make a play for senior lieutenant gorbunova bagnall said meditatively its the easiest way i can think of to get tatiana out of my hair for good except that if she really is out to have you come hell or high water losing you to ludmila is liable to endanger that young lady ken embry said there i have my doubts bagnall said ludmila is not as outwardly ferocious as tatiana that i grant you but she can take care of herself i should hope so jerome jones burst out how many combat missions has she flown in that rickety little biplane of hers more than i like to think about thats certain you wouldnt get me up in the air in one of those things especially not where people are trying to shoot me down amen to that bagnall said she doesnt go any too high in the air eitherleaves herself a target for any bloke on the ground with a rifle he knew she would have been a target for worse things than rifle fire had she strayed high enough for radar to pick her up but the idea of being vulnerable to simple infantry weapons chilled him to the marrow if she can take care of herself you really should make a play for her embry said that would get you out of harms way and might even reconcile tatiana to jones here see what a leonora eyles im getting to be he added naming the advice columnist forwomens own magazine this ointment does have one fly in it jerome jones said namely the jerry who flew into pskov with our intrepid pilot schultz thats what hes called have you never seen him casting sheeps eyes at her ive seen that yes bagnall said but ive never seen ludmila casting any back his way hes a rugged specimen but im not afraid of him he rubbed his chin id not care to put us in a bad odor with the germans either though if were not seen to be honest brokers between the nazis and the reds everything weve accomplished goes up in smokeand so very likely does pskov bloody hell of a thing ken embry remarked when you cant even make a play for a pretty girl for fear of causing an international incident international incidents be damned bagnall said i dont care about that aspect of it at all but if making a play for a pretty girl will get me killed and this town blown up around my ears that does make me thoughtful i admit nice to know something can embry said with a grin south of pskov antiaircraft guns began to hammer a moment later cannon inside the city started throwing shells into the air with training instilled when theluftwaffe had been pounding england the three raf men leaped into the nearest hole in the ground a large bomb crater the crater was muddy at the bottom but bagnall didnt care about that not when a couple of lizard jets were screaming overhead low enough that their banshee wail all but deafened him as he buried his face in the cool wet dirt he tried to remember what sort of targets were nearby in a mechanized war such matters determined who lived and who died bombs raining down made the ground shake bagnall had never experienced an earthquake but was of the opinion that being bombed made a satisfactory substitute still pursued by shells the lizard fighterbombers streaked away to the north every so often the antiaircraft gunners got lucky and brought down a lizard plane they expended a great whacking lot of shells between kills though shrapnel pattered down like hot jagged hailstones bagnall wished for a tin hat shrapnel wouldnt tear you into gory rags the way bomb fragments did it wasnt going fast enough but a big chunk could fracture your skull or do other unpleasant things to the one and only wonderful and precious body you ever got when the aa guns fell silent and the rain of machined brass and steel stopped ken embry got to his feet and began brushing dirt and muck from his clothes the other two englishmen followed rather more slowly all in a days work embry said shall we brew up some of the russians alleged tea when we get back to our digs why not bagnall answered his heart was still pounding in animal response to the bombing but his mind remained untroubled and collected as embry had said it was all in a days workand that struck bagnall as the most damning indictment of all rance auerbach hated everything about lamar colorado it reminded him all too vividly of the mediumsmall west texas town where hed grown up and which hed left as soon as he could that would have been bad enough all by itself but just being in lamar also reminded him the lizards had thrown him and his men out of lakin kansas that being so he sneered at everything pertaining to lamar the town was dirtier than it had been when he and his force sallied against lakin it smelled of horse manure normally that smell bothered him not in the least he was a cavalryman after all there wasnt a town in the united states that didnt smell of horse manure nowadays either auerbach was determined not to let facts get between him and his anger one thing lamar did boast was a goodly number of watering holes what they served these days was moonshine liquor so raw it would have made better disinfectant than booze no one who drank it complained not with nothing better available auerbach would not have imagined a small town like lamar could hold surprises but he was proved wrong about that coming out of one of the local watering holes was a cavalry trooper who filled a uniform in ways the quartermaster generals office never would have imagined before the lizards landed seeing him the trooper snapped to attention captain auerbach she said at ease private rance answered were both off duty right this minute he shook his head in bemusement and since we are off duty do you mind if i still call you rachel no sir not at all rachel hines answered smiling auerbach shook his head again he could have picked her up with one hand but somehow she still looked like a cavalry trooper even if she wasnt exactly a cavalryman she lacked the devilmaycare relish for danger some of his men had but she didnt look as if shed flinch from it and she did look as if she wouldnt lose her head while it was going on but all of those things in a way were beside the point he came to the point how the devil did you talk colonel nordenskold into letting you enlist she smiled again you promise you wont tell anybody else when auerbach nodded she lowered her voice and went on he tried putting his hand where it didnt belong and i told him that if he did it again id kick him right in the nutsif he had any that is auerbach knew he was gaping but couldnt help it that wasnt the way hed imagined rachel hines persuading the colonel to sign her up just the opposite in fact if shed been smart enough to study the ground and change her plan of attack after she saw that a blatant comeon hadnt worked with auerbach she had more brains than hed figured my hats off to you he said and fit action to word it took a little more than that though didnt it i showed him i could ride i showed him i could shoot i showed him i could shut up and take orders she answered he was looking for people who could do those things and were so short of the ones who can that he didnt much care if i had to go at my uniform with scissors and needle and thread before itd fit right he looked her up and down if you dont mind my saying soif it wont make you kick like a broncit fits you just fine captain you can say whatever you please she answered you got me out of lakin out from under the lizards thumbs i owe you more than i can figure out how to pay you back for that back when shed offered him a roll in the hay to get what she wanted he hadnt been interested now he wasnow she sounded interested in him as a person not a stepping stone but if she was bound and determined to be a soldier shed be a hell of a lot better off not going to bed with an officer if women were going to fight the fewer the rules that got bent out of shape the better for everybody women and men instead of making any suggestions then auerbach asked hows penny getting along these days i hadnt seen you since i came back here and i havent seen her either rachel hines sunny face clouded shes not so good captain shes moved to a room in the rooming house off the street here and she mostly just stays in it even when she does come out its almost like youre watching a ghost not a real person if you know what i mean like shes here but not quite really all here thats what i saw before auerbach said glumly i was hoping shed started to snap out of it by now me too rachel said she was so much fun to be with when we were in high school together she came to an abrupt halt nothing much was left of the kearny county consolidated high school not after the lizards set up their local base there the americans drove them out of it and then they came back and pushed the americans back toward the kansascolorado line as he had before rance wondered what would happen to the generation of kids whose schooling the lizards had interrupted even if mankind won making up for lost time wouldnt be easy if the lizards won odds were that nobody would have an education ever again he didnt care to think about that he didnt care to think about a lot of the ways the war was going maybe i ought to go over there and see her he said after a moment its my fault shes here after allmy fault youre here too come to that i wouldnt call it a fault captain rachel hines said if we hadnt come with you wed still be back in lakin doing what the lizards told us anything is better than that tell it towhat was his name wendell summers auerbach answered harshly he hadnt tried to get out of lakin hed be alive back there today we all knew there was a chance of that when we went with you peopleit was a chance we all wanted to take auerbach didnt know whether rachel had seen action but she talked and shrugged like a veteran she continued penny has taken that hard i will say i know auerbach kicked at the sidewalk maybe she wont want to see me at all god knows i couldnt blame her for that the worst thing she can tell you is no rachel said if she does how are you worse off but if she doesnt you may do her some good she saluted again and headed up the street auerbach turned to watch her go then laughed at himself he didnt remember admiring a cavalry troopers backside before and a good thing too he said with a snort he walked over to the rooming house where penny summers was staying the place was always packed but with a shifting population refugees who had been there for a while headed farther west into more securely held territory while a continuous stream of newcomers from kansas took their place penny had kept her room since not long after shed come from lakin which made her wellnigh unique auerbachs nose twitched as he walked upstairs the rooming house smelled of unwashed bodies garbage and stale piss if you bottled the odor youd call it something like essence of despair no sergeant worth his stripes would have tolerated a tenth of it for a second but the army had all it could handle fighting the lizards and trying to keep itself on its feet the civilian part of lamar had been left to sink or swim on its own he didnt think that was good management but he didnt feel like belling the cat either he knocked on penny summers door he didnt know whether shed be there or not a lot of civilians in lamar spent their days working for the army one way or another he hadnt seen penny busy with any of that though and lamar was small enough that he thought he would have if shed been doing it somewhere down the hall a baby started to scream the sound ground at auerbachs nerves like a dentists drill digging into a molar you had to be crazy to want to bring up a kid in times like these of course just because you were bringing up a kid didnt necessarily mean you wanted one only that you had one he knocked on the door again he was about to turn and go a prospect not altogether unwelcome because the baby was doing a pretty good impression of the noise that came from a lizard jet fighter engine when penny summers opened it she looked surprised to see him he got the idea she would have looked surprised to see anyone captain auerbach she said and gestured vaguely come in the room was cramped and even with the window open stiflingly hot dust lay thick on every surface auerbach thought about shouting at her like a tough sergeant but decided it would do more harm than good shouting wouldnt snap her out of the state she was in he didnt know what would but he was sure of that he said im worried about you you should be out and doing things not sitting here cooped up like a canary in a cage what do you do all day anyhow that vague gesture again i sit i sew sometimes i read my bible she pointed to the book with the limp leatherette covers and gold leaf that sat on the little table next to the bed its not enough he said theres a whole big world out there i dont want any part of it she answered laughing there are all sorts of worlds out there the lizards showed us that didnt they hed never heard her laugh not since her father was blown to bits before her eyes but this was so bitter hed sooner never have heard it either i dont want any part of them i just want to be left alone two things ran through auerbachs mind first was greta garbo second texan that he was was the defiant rallying cry of the confederacy against the damnyankees all we want is to be left alone but neither one fit penny summers not really what shed wanted was to grow up in lakin marry a farmer who lived nearby raise a flock of kids and get as old as she was going to get all without going fifty miles from where she was born it might not have happened even if the lizards hadnt come the war could have put her in a factory somewhere in a city and who could guess what she might have done after that once you saw a city going back to a small town or a farm often didnt look the same but he couldnt tell her that her life might not have gone as shed planned it because here and now her life sure as hell hadnt gone as shed planned it he said miss penny sitting here like a broody hen on a nest doesnt do you any good things wont get better on account of it the more you go out and do things the sooner youll be able to put whats past behind you and go on with the rest of your life what difference does it make she answered dully the world can go on without me just fine it looks like and i dont like what the worlds turned into id sooner stay here and let things happen if a bomb lands on this place this minute or tomorrow or a week from now ill be sorry for the other people who live here but not for me hed had troopers who talked like that after theyd been through more battle than a man could stand shell shock theyd called it back in the first world war combat fatigue was the name it went by these days penny had been in only that one fight but how many troopers got to watch their fathers turned to raw meat right before their eyes you couldnt guess beforehand what would send any one person over the edge you couldnt tell what would snap anybody out of it either sometimes nothing would some of his men werent fit for anything better than taking care of horses here in lamar a couple had seemed well enough to ride but didnt bother taking any precautions when they went up against the lizards they werent around any more and a couple of others had been through the worst of it and got better again no way to know who would do what he took her by the shoulders and hugged her hard she was an attractive girl but it wasnt like holding a woman in his arms it reminded him more of the embraces hed given his grandfather after the old mans wits started to wander the body was there but the will that directed it wasnt minding the store he let her go youve got to do this for yourself miss penny nobody on gods green earth can do it for you i think youd best go now she said her face hadnt changed not even a little bit defeated he opened the door to her room and started for the stairs in the room down the hall the baby was still screaming bloody murder a couple of doors farther down a man and a woman shouted angrily at each other almost too soft for auerbach to hear penny summers called after him be careful captain he spun around her door was already closed he wondered if he should go back after a moments hesitation he headed down the stairs instead maybe he hadnt lost or not completely after all since the british army was swinging southward anyhow the better to fight the remaining lizard forces on english soil moishe russie got to go into london for a day to see if he could find his family the instant he reached the outskirts of the great city he realized he could throw off his red cross armband and desert and no one would ever be the wiser london had been battered before now it seemed nothing but ruins a man might hide in there for years coming out only to forage for food by the filthy furtive look of a good many people on the street that was just what they did a lot of them in better condition carried guns russie got the idea those werent only for defense against possible lizard paratroopers making his way through the rubble toward his familys soho flat was anything but easy street signs had been missing since the nazi threat in now whole streets had disappeared so choked with rubble and cratered by bombs as to be impassable worse a lot of the landmarks hed used to orient himself as he went about the city were no longer standing the tower of big ben the marble arch in hyde park the queen victoria memorial near buckingham palace on a cloudy day like this one even knowing which way was south was a tricky business hed walked along oxford street for a couple of blocks before he realized where he was no more than a block from the bbc overseas services studio the brick building that housed it had not been wrecked by bomb or shell a man with a rifle stood outside at first russie thought he was one of the soldiers who had guarded the studio he needed a moment to realize eric blair wore a tin hat and bandolier of cartridges blair took even longer to recognize russie as moishe approached the englishman brought the rifle up in unmistakable warning he handled the leeenfield with assurance moishe remembered hed fought in the spanish civil war then blair let the stock of the rifle fall to the grimy sidewalk russie isnt it he said still not quite sure yes thats right moishe answered in his uncertain english and you are blair if he could put a name to the other blair might be less inclined to shoot him he pointed to the doorway do we still work here not bloody likely the englishman said with a shake of the head that threatened to throw off his helmet londons had no power for a fortnight now maybe longer im here to ensure that no one steals the equipment nothing more if we were doing anything theyd set out fitter guards than i he scowled if any fitter are left alive that is off to the south artillery spoke a distant mutter in the air the lizards in the northern pocket were dead fled or surrendered but in the south they fought on moishe said my familyhave you heard anything im sorry blair shook his head again i wish i could tell you something but i cant for that matter i cant say with certainty whether my own kinsfolk are alive or dead bloody war he started to cough held his breath till he swayed and managed to calm the spasm whew he said those tear me to pieces when they get goingi might as well be breathing mustard gas russie started to say something to that but at the last minute held his peace no one who hadnt seen the effect of the gas at close range had any business talking about it but by the same token no one who hadnt seen it would believe it to his surprise blair went on i know i shouldnt be speaking of it so gas is a filthy business the things we do to survive would gag attila the hun but attila to be fair never had to contend with invaders from another world this is so russie said good luck to you i go now see if i can find my family good luck to you too blair said you should carry a weapon of some sort the war has made beasts of us all and some of the beasts are more dangerous to a good and decent man than the lizards ever dreamt of being it may be so moishe answered not meaning a word of it blair was a good and decent man himself but hed never been in the clutches of the lizardsor the germans either come to that russie walked south down regent street toward soho a lizard plane darted overhead along with everyone else close by he threw himself flat and rolled toward the nearest hole in the ground he could find when the plane had passed over he picked himself up and went on he hardly thought about it hed been doing the same sort of thing since the only difference he could find between soho and the rest of london was that misery was expressed in more languages in the cosmopolitan district the barcelona a restaurant eric blair favored was still open for business on beak street boards covered what had been a glass front from the smoke that rose from the rear of the place the proprietor used more boards with which to cook if londons electricity was gone surely no gas flowed through its mains either when moishe trudged past the barcelona he knew his own block of flats was not far away he picked up the pace desperate to find out what had become of his wife and son and at the same time dreading what he might learn he turned off beak onto lexington street and then to broadwick in which his block of flats lay no sooner had he done so than he let out a long sigh of relief the building still stood that did not necessarily prove anything the neighborhood like all london neighborhoods hed seen had taken heavy damage if rivka and reuven had been outside at the wrong moment he did his best not to think about that in the street strewn though it was with bricks broken chunks of concrete and jagged shards of glass life went on boys shouted as they kicked around a football the goal posts on the improvised pitch were upright boards undoubtedly scavenged from some wrecked house or shop the boys played with the same combination of abandon and grim intensity their polish counterparts would have shown shouting and laughing as they ran not until later would they turn into the calm undemonstrative englishmen moishe found so strange a crowd of children a few adults scattered through it stood watching the football match and cheering on one team or the other moishe took no special notice of the adults seeing so many children idling on the sidewalks though left him sad even when things were worst in warsaw hundreds of schools had gone on under the nazis noses children might die but they would not die ignorant he noted much less of that spirit here than he had in the ghetto one of the football teams scored a goal one of the watching men reached into a pocket and passed a coin to the fellow behind him the english did like to gamble boys swarmed onto the pitch to pummel the lad whod sent the ball past the opponents goalkeeper moishe ran onto the pitch too the boy he swept up into the air was too small to have been a player the boy squeaked in surprise then he shouted papa the word was english not yiddish or polish but moishe didnt care reuven stared at him and said what happened to your beard papa the gas mask wont fit over it tight enough so i shaved it off russie answered naked cheeks however strange they felt were better than a lungful of mustard gas hed seen that heart pounding in his chest he asked the next question where is your mother in the flat reuven said indifferently as if to askwhere would she be could you put me down please theyre starting to play again and i want to watch im sorry moishe said his voice full of mock humility however important his homecoming was to him his son seemed well able to take it in stride moishe got out of the street just in time to evade a football flying past his ear reuven squirmed and again demanded to be released moishe set him on the scarred sidewalk and climbed the stairs to his flat as fast as he could from behind the door across the hall came the sounds of a hideous row mr and mrs stephanopoulos were going at it hammer and tongs russie couldnt understand a word of the greek they were using to slang each other but it made him feel at home anyway the stephanopouloi cared about each other cared enough to yell englishmen and women seemed much more given to cold deadly silences he tried the knob to the door of his own flat it turned in his hand he opened the door rivka was bustling across the front room toward the kitchen her gray eyes widened in astonishment maybe the racket the stephanopouloi were making had kept her from hearing him in the hall maybe too she needed a moment to recognize him cleanshaven as he was and in the khaki battledress of a british soldier astonishment of one sort turned to astonishment of another moishe she whispered still sounding disbelieving and ran to him they held each other she squeezed him so tight he could hardly breathe against his shoulder she said i cant believe youre really here i cant believeyoure here you and reuven he answered ive prayed you would be but we know what prayers are worth these days and with everything the lizards have done to london he shook his head in this war civilians behind the line are liable to catch it worse than soldiers at the front weve seen that ever since the nazis started bombing warsaw i was so afraid for you were all right rivkas hands flew to her hair in an automatic altogether unconscious effort to spruce up the kitchen is full of soot because ive had to cook with wood since the gas went out but thats all i was goingmeshuggeh worrying over you there without even a gun in the middle of all the bullets and bombs and the terrible gas the bombs here she shrugged it was terrible yes but nothing we havent known before if they dont land right on top of you youre all right and if they do you probably wont know about it anyhow thats not so bad no moishe agreed after almost three years of slow starvation and disease in the warsaw ghetto such fatalism came easy next to them sudden probably painless death could look downright attractive rivka said theres still someveal left from last night if youre hungry the slight hesitation told moishe the veal was probably pork and that his wife was trying to shield him from knowingly eating forbidden food hed done the same for her in warsaw accepting the pretense at face value he said i can always eat field rations are thin civilian rations were even thinner and he knew it he left a good deal on the plate rivka hadnt expected him to show up she and reuven would need to make a meal or more than one out of what shed fixed when he said he couldnt possibly hold another bite she looked knowingly at him but did not protest as she would have before the war she dipped water out of a bucket to accompany the meal it was lukewarm and had the flat airless taste that said it had been boiled he smiled im glad youre being careful with what you drink ive seen what happens when people arent careful she answered seriously being married to a medical student taught me that much anyhow im glad he said again he carried plate and fork over to the sink it was full of soapy water even now it made a good washbasin he washed his dishes and set them by the sink rivka watched him somewhere between amusement and bemusement defensively he said being apart from you ive learned to do these things you see yes i do see she said from her tone he couldnt tell whether she approved or was scandalized she went on what else have you learned being apart from me that i dont like being apart from you he answered through the window came fresh cheers from the street below one of the boys football teams had just scored in a speculative voice moishe remarked reuven really seems to enjoy watching the match down there enough for us to hope he wont come upstairs for the next little while do you mean rivka asked moishe nodded his head jerking up and down in hopeful eagerness from the way his wife giggled he suspected he looked like a perfectshlemiel he didnt care especially not after she said i suppose we can do that privacy is where you find it or make it he tried to remember the last time hed lain on a bed it hadnt happened more than once or twice since hed been shoehorned into the forces fighting desperately to keep britain free of the invading aliens theyd given him a bag of medical supplies a uniform an armband and a gas mask and theyd sent him out to do his best comfort hadnt been part of the bargain as if by way of experiment rivka kissed his bare cheek bristly she said i think i like your beard better unless you can shave your face very smooth getting my hands on a razor hasnt always been easy he answered i never would have done it at all but it makes a mask fit properly he didnt want to think about gas masks and the things that could go wrong if they failed to fit properly not when he lay beside his wife in an oasis of peace and calm in the midst of chaos and war for the next little while he didnt think about anything but rivka but try as you would to stretch such moments they had to end rivka sat up and began to dress as fast as she could partly that was ingrained modesty and partly a welljustified fear that reuven would choose the most inconvenient time possible to walk into the flat both those concerns also drove moishe back into his clothes the shoddy serge of his battledress scraped his skin as he pulled it on rivka reached behind her neck to fasten the last catch as if that were a signal that the everyday dangerous world had returned she asked how long will you be able to stay here just tonight he answered i have to go south tomorrow to help the wounded in the fighting against the lizards there how is the fight really going rivka asked when theres power for the wireless and when they can print newspapers they say theyre smashing the lizards the way samson smote the philistines but lizard planes keep on pounding london the boom of the artillery never goes away and shells keep falling on us can i believe what they claim the northern pocket is gonekaputt moishe said borrowing a word hed heard german soldiers use as for the southern one your guess is as good as mine all i know about the fighting is what ive seen for myself and thats like asking a fish in a pool to tell you everything about the vistula if england were losing the fight badly though youd be talking with a lizard right now not with me that is so she said thoughtfully but after peoplehuman beingshave lost so many fights its hard to believe that just holding the lizards back should count as a victory when you think of how many people couldnt slow the lizards down let alone stop them then holding them backis a victory and a big one i dont ever remember them pulling back from a fight the way they did from the northern pocket the english have hurt them moishe shook his head in wonder for so long we didnt think anything or anyone could hurt them the front door to the flat opened then closed with a slam reuven shouted is there anything to eat im hungry moishe and rivka looked at each other and started to laugh the noise let reuven find them whats so funny he demanded with the indignation of a child who knows a joke is going over his head nothing his father answered gravely we slipped one by you thats all one what reuven said rivka sent moishe a warning glance the boy was really too young moishe just laughed harder even with the rumble of artillery always in the background for this little while he could savor being with his wife and son tomorrow the war would fold him in its bony arms once more today he was free and reveled in his freedom the silvery metal did not look like much it was so dense that what the metallurgical laboratory had managed to produce seemed an even smaller amount than it really was appearances mattered not at all to leslie groves he knew what he had here enough plutonium when added together with what the germans and russians had stolen from the lizards and the british brought over to the usa to make an atomic bomb that would go boom and not fizzle he turned to enrico fermi theres the first long hard step by god after this we have a downhill track an easier track general yes but not an easy one the italian physicist answered we still have to purify the plutonium to shape it into a bomb and to find a way to explode the bomb where we want it those are all engineering concerns groves said im an engineer i know we can meet them the physics was what worried mei wasnt sure wed ever see enough plutonium metal he waved toward the small silver lump fermi laughed for me it is just the opposite the physics we have found is straightforward enough advancing from it to the finished bomb though is a challenge of a different sort whatever sort of challenge it is well meet it groves declared we cant afford to be like the russiansone shot and out well hit the lizards again and again until we make em say uncle from what i understand of the russians design they are lucky to have achieved any explosion at all fermi said a guntype device with plutonium he shook his head it must have been a very large gun with a very high velocity to the slab of plutonium it accelerated into the larger plug otherwise fission would have begun prematurely disrupting the mass before the full power of the nuclear reaction built up they could build it any size they wanted i suppose groves said they werent going to load it in a bomber after all he laughed at that a laugh edged with bitterness for one thing they dont have a bomber big enough to carry even a small nuclear bomb for another if they did the lizards would shoot it down before it got where it was supposed to go so why not build big no reason i can see fermi answered the same applies to us in large degree we will not be able to deliver the bomb from the air once we have it putting it in the proper place at the proper time will not be easy i know groves rubbed his chin he didnt like thinking about that the way the russians did it from what they say was to leave the bomb hidden in a position they knew the lizards were going to overrun in a few hours they set their timer and waited for the big boom wed have a harder time finding a position of that sort chicago fermi said quietly mm yeah maybe groves admitted thats a meat grinder no mistake about it i see two problems with it though getting the bomb from here to chicago once its done is one hell getting a bomb from here to anywhere is going to be a problem so thats number one and number two is pulling our boys back so we dont take out one of our own divisions along with the lizards why should that be a problem the physicist asked they simply retreat allowing the lizards to move forward and that is that leslie groves smiled down at him groves had been an engineer throughout his years in the military hed never led troops in combat nor wanted to but hed forgotten more about strategy than fermi had ever learnednice to be reminded there were still some things he knew more about than the eggheads he was supposed to be bossing as patiently as he could he answered professor weve been fighting the lizards tooth and toenail outside of chicago and now in it ever since they came down from space if we all of a sudden start pulling back without an obvious good reason dont you think theyre going to get suspicious about why were changing our ways i know i would if i were their co ahh fermi said he might have been naive but he wasnt dumb not even a little bit i see what you mean general the russians were already in fullscale retreat so the lizards noticed nothing out of the ordinary when they passed the point where the bomb was hidden but if we go from stout resistance to quick withdrawal they will observe something is amiss thats it groves agreed thats it exactly wed have to either convince em that theyd licked us and we were getting out of dodge i beg your pardon fermi interrupted sorry i mean retreating as fast as we can go groves said fermi spoke with a thick accent but he usually understood what you said to him groves reminded himself to be less colloquial either we do that or else we pull back secretlyunder cover of night maybe thats how i see it anyhow to me this is a sensible plan fermi said if the time comes will they think of it in chicago they should theyre solid professional soldiers but groves wondered fermi was naive about the way soldiers handled their job every reason he should have been too but why should anyone assume the generals out there actually fighting the lizards were anything but naive about what an atomic bomb could do calculations from a bunch of scholarly people who went around carrying slide rules instead of carbines wouldnt mean much to them groves decided hed better sit his fanny down and bang out a memo he couldnt be sure anyone would pay any attention to that either but at least it would havebrigadier general us army under his name which might make soldiers sit up and take notice the only real thing he was sure of was that they certainly wouldnt know what to expect if hedidnt sit down and write that was all a man of action needed to know excuse me professor fermi he said and hurried away the typewriter was waiting atvar studied the computer display of the slow track of tosev around its parent sun equinox he said as if it were blasphemy against the revered name of the emperor truth exalted fleetlord kirel didnt sound any happier at the selfevident astronomical fact than had his superior he put the reason for his distaste into words winter will now approach in the northern hemisphere where so many tosevite notempires remain unsubdued both highranking males contemplated that for a while in unhappy silence the probe the race had sent to tosev centuries before had warned that the planets weather grew extremely intemperate in winter still the races equipment was imperfectly adapted for such climates the ruling assumption had been that the conquest would be over and done long before such things mattered and no one back on home had imagined that the tosevites could have industrialized in the space of a few short centuries let alone developed equipment better designed than anything the race had for dealing with all the appalling varieties of muck and frozen water indigenous to tosev in winter still gloomily kirel resumed during the last winter we lost the strategic advantage over broad areas of the planet when bad weather begins the big uglies will assail us with more sophisticated weapons than they employed two of our years ago this does not cause me to look on the likely results of the upcoming combat with optimism unrestrained i assure you shiplord i have not looked on this conquest with optimism unrestrained since we discovered the big uglies knew enough to employ radio atvar answered but we are not in an entirely disadvantageous position in regard to the tosevites either we have made serious inroads on their industrial capacity they produce far less than they did when we first arrived our own industrial capacity on tosev however remains effectively nil kirel said we can produce more ammunition all well and good though even there we rely to some degree on captured tosevite factories but who in his wildest nightmares would have thought of the need to manufacture landcruisers and killercraft in large numbers to replace combat losses no one but it remains a reality whether we thought of it or not atvar said we have serious weaknesses in both areas as well as in antimissile missiles we were lucky to have brought any of those at all but now our stocks are nearly exhausted and demand remains unrelenting the deutsche may their eggshells be thinned by pestcontrol poisons not only throw missiles at us but load them with their poisonous gases rather than with ordinary explosives these missiles must be shot down before they reach their targets or they can do dreadful damage our ability to accomplish this is degraded with every antimissile missile we expend we have knocked the island of britain out of the fight against us for some indefinite time atvar said that was true but it was also putting the best possible face on things and he knew it the campaign on britain had been intended to annex the island like a lot of intentions on tosev that one had not survived contact with the big uglies the losses in males and materiel were appalling and certainly had cost the race far more than the temporary neutralization of britain could repay after what looked like a careful mental search kirel did find an authentic bright spot to mention it does appear virtually certain exalted fleetlord that the sssr possessed but the single atomic weapon it used against us operations there can resume their previous tempo at least until winter comes no not until winter not in the sssr atvar said sharply long before that the rains begin there and turn the local road network into an endless sea of gluey muck we bogged down there badly two years ago during the last local autumn and then again in the spring when all the frozen water that had accumulated there through winter proceeded to melt truth exalted fleetlord i had forgotten kirel seemed to fold in on himself for a moment acknowledging his error almost angrily he continued the big uglies of the sssr are a pack of lazy incompetent fools to build a road system unusable one part of the year in three i wish they were a pack of lazy incompetent fools atvar answered lazy incompetent fools though could not have built and detonated an atomic device even if the plutonium was stolen from our stockpile as a matter of fact prisoner interrogations imply that the roads are so shoddy for a strategic reason to hinder invasion from deutschland to the west they certainly had reason to fear such invasion at any rate and the measures taken against the deutsche have also served to hinder us so they have kirel hissed in anger of all the tosevite notempires i most want to see the sssr overthrown i realize that their emperor was but a big ugly but to take him from his throne and murder him he shuddered such thoughts would never have crossed our minds before we came to tosev if males ever had them they are vanished in the prehistory of the race or they were until the big uglies recalled them to unwholesome life i know atvar said sadly even after we do conquer this world after the colonization fleet sets down here i fear tosevite ideas may yet corrupt us the rabotevs and hallessi differ from us in body but in spirit the empires three races might have hatched from the same egg the big uglies are alien alien which makes them all the more dangerous kirel said if the colonization fleet were not following us i might think sterilizing tosev the wisest course so straha proposed early on atvar replied have you come round to the traitors view his voice grew soft and dangerous as he asked that question strahas broadcasts from the usa had hurt morale more than he liked to admit no exalted fleetlord i said if the colonization fleet were not following us but it is which limits our options kirel hesitated then continued as we have noted before the tosevites unfortunately operate under no such restraints if they construct more nuclear weapons they will use them the other thing i doubt is the effectiveness of nuclear weapons as intimidators against them atvar said we have destroyed berlin washington and now tokyo the deutsche and americans keep right on fighting us and the nipponese also seem to be carrying on but when the soviet big uglies detonated their device they intimidated us for a long period of time that is not how warfare against a primitive species should progress one thing the tosevites have taught us technology and political sophistication do not necessarily travel together kirel said for us dealings between empires are principles to be absorbed out of old texts from previous conquests for the big uglies they are the everyday stuff of life no wonder then that they find it easier to manipulate us than we them by the emperorhe cast down his eyesthat might have been true even if they were as technologically backwards as our probes led us to believe so it might but then they would not have had the strength to back up their deviousness atvar said now they do and sooner or later the soviets will manage to build another nuclear weapon or the deutsche or the americansand then more difficult choices will present themselves to us difficult yes kirel said we suspect the americans and the deutsche and the british as well of having nuclear programs as the soviets surely do but what if we cannot find the source of their production as we were lucky enough to manage with the nipponese shall we destroy one of their cities instead taking vengeance for their nuclear attacks in that way it is to be considered atvar answered many things are to be considered which we had not contemplated before we came here that made him nervous in and of itself maneuvering through uncharted territory was not what the race did best it was seldom something the race had to do at all for those who led knew their kinds weaknesses full well but on tosev atvar found himself with only the choice of too many choices the ruined gray stone castle before which ussmak had halted his landcruiser seemed to him immeasurably old intellectually he knew the frowning pile of stone could hardly have stood there for more than a couple of thousand years half that if you counted by tosev s slow revolutions around its primaryhardly a flick of the nictitating membrane in the history of the race but his own people had not built such structures since days now more nearly legendary than historical none survived a hundred thousand years and more of earthquakes erosion and constant construction had seen to that chugging up the hill to the castle at farnham ussmak had felt transported in time back to primitive days unfortunately the british were not so primitive now as they had been when they ran up the castle either otherwise ussmaks landcruiser would not have had to retreat from its attempted river crossing to aid the males in the northern pocket the northern pocket had no males left in it now some had been evacuated more were dead or captured back in the turret nejas called out front ussmak peered through his own vision slits trying to find the target the landcruiser commander had spotted he waited for skoob to answer identified instead the gunner said doubtfully what have you found superior sir that group of tosevite males advancing along the highway bearing as near zero as makes no difference nejas answered give them a round of high explosive it will teach them not to show themselves so openly it shall be done superior sir skoob said the autoloader clanged as it slammed a shell into the branch of the landcruisers main armament on the way skoob said an instant before the big gun roared and the landcruiser rocked back on its tracks absorbing the recoil the big uglies knew enough to move forward in open order which left them less vulnerable to artillery fire even so several males went down when the shell burst among them those who had not been hit quickly joined their comrades on the ground well aimed skoob ussmak exclaimed one round and you stopped the advance cold thank you driver skoob answered im not used to retreating of course i obey for the good of the race but i dont much fancy it nor i ussmak said every time he sneaked a taste of ginger he was filled with the urge to charge forward into the ranks of the big uglies smashing them with the landcruisers tracks while the gunner and commander used the weapons in the turret to work a great slaughter he knew that was the herb doing his thinking for him but knowing it made the urge no less urgent no one fancies retreating nejas said landcruiser males are trained to be first into battle to tear holes in the enemys force through which others may pass now our task is to keep the british from tearing holes in our force and to be the last ones out of battle difficult i grant you but less far removed from our basic role than you might think truth ussmak said but not satisfying truth forgive me for speaking so boldly superior sir i do forgive you driver but i also remind you of our task here nejas said the race has but one airstrip on this island out of range of british artillery that at the place called tangmere south of here not far from the sea as long as we can hold the british away from it we can freely bring in supplies and evacuate wounded males as well as those being withdrawn truth ussmak repeated he followed the strategy but giving up ground to the tosevites still seemed strange to him the deutsche were probably better warriors in a technical sense than the british but here every tosevite whether formally a warrior or not was an enemy he hadnt felt that in the sssr or france some there had seemed willing to serve the race on its terms not in britain here they fought with everything they had as if thinking along with him nejas said we cant let them get within artillery range of tangmere if they do theyll plaster the airstrip with the hideous poison gas of theirs he paused for a moment then went on and from what ive heard we have it lucky the deutsche are using a gas that makes this one seem tame one good whiff and you fall over dead ussmak said superior sir if what we have here is good luck i dont ever want to see the bad nor i skoob agreed to nejas he added i see more big uglies in the fields and along the road to the north shall i give them another couple of rounds of high explosive pick your own targets skoob the landcruiser commander answered remember what ammunition resupply has been like lately though we have to hold this position and keep on holding it till were ordered to fall back again that probably wont be until our time for evacuation comes up theyre using armor for a shell and pulling back all the soft meat behind it back when we first started the campaign on tosev ussmak said his words punctuated by the deep rumble of the landcruisers main armament one of our landcruisers could sit out in the middle of open country and dominate as far as its cannon could reach he let out a long hissing sigh its not like that any more not here thats certain nejas said britain hardly has open spaces worthy of the name there are always trees or hedgerows or stone fences or buildings to give cover to the big uglies when we first landed too they didnt have any antilandcruiser weapons worthy of the name nothing this side of big guns anyway and big guns are easy to spot and neutralize but now any sneaking infantrymale can carry a rocket or one of those springlaunched eggaddlers the british use they still cant hurt us from the front but from the sides or rear weve lost too many landcruisers that way skoob traversed the turret a couple of hundredths and fired again two other landcruisers held positions slightly lower on the hill that led up to farnham castle they also sent highexplosive rounds into the loose ranks of the oncoming british males again and again the british went to ground again and again the survivors got up and kept moving forward i wish we had more infantrymales in the ruins of the town down there ussmak said some of those big uglies will get in among themas you said superior sirand work their way toward us neither of his crewmales argued with him he wondered if this was what the tosevites had felt at the outset of the campaign when for a while the race swept all before it the numbing sense that try as you would to stop it something would go wrong and youd end up dead or maimed on account of it a flight of killercraft roared low overhead from out of the south dropping bombs on the big uglies and strafing them with their cannon a series of runs like that by multiple flights would have ruined the british but the race had neither the aircraft nor the munitions to expend in such lavish quantities that meant the british would not be ruined it also probably meant the races forces in britain would ussmak desperately wanted a taste of ginger without the herb the world was a depressing gloomy cold placenot that hed ever found tosev anything but cold even with a taste or two inside him but the cloud that settled over his spirit when hed gone too long without ginger made the world feel even worse than it was and defeat seem a certainty no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than something exploded against the side armor of one of the landcruisers farther down the hill one of the revolting things about the british springlaunched antilandcruiser bombs was that they gave no clue about their launch site as say a missile did this bomb by good fortune did not penetrate the landcruisers armor perhaps because it hadnt landed squarely after the initial blast no smoke mounted skyward no escape hatches popped open no males bailed out of the landcruiser instead the turret slewed rapidly through a quarter of a circle the machine gun coaxial with the main armament chattered angrily but if anything in the ruins of farnham stirred ussmak didnt see it the big uglies weapons get better all the time he said we have the same ones we started out with and we dont have as many of them the tosevite substitutes were getting are shoddy and we dont have enough of those either why cant we be the ones who invent something new for a change neither nejas nor skoob answered him they did not need to answer him he had already answered himself the race looked warily on invention when it did happen the results were fed into the culture of the empire a tiny bit at a time so as not to create instability steadiness counted for more than quickness the past hundred thousand years that had worked well it did not work well on tosev his crewmales also had another less abstract reason for not answering him they were trying to spot the big ugly whod launched the bomb at the nearby landcruiser ussmak peered through his own vision slits but his field of view was too narrow to offer him much hope of getting a glimpse of the dangerous tosevite he heard a metallic rasp from the turret nejas was sticking his head out for a direct look around that was what a good landcruiser commander was supposed to do looking out at the world through the periscopes that ringed the cupola didnt let you see enough to be sure you were safe but if you did stand up in the cupola by definition you were no longer safe the moment nejas emerged british males started shooting at him two bullets ricocheted off the turret and another cracked past before he ducked back down and slammed the cupola lid with a clang i didnt see any big uglies he said the words punctuated by swift harsh breathing that doesnt mean they didnt see me by the emperor i hope that other landcruiser took out the male with the bomb launcher if he didnt if he didnt well find out quite soon skoob said the silence that followed probably meant his mouth had fallen open in a laugh he went on i havent come close to spotting him hes good at what he does by now on this planet the males who arent good warriors are mostly dead on their side and ours both ussmak was still alive so he supposed he was good at what he did by skoobs standard at any rate he wished he could taste some ginger then hed feel alive too he hissed bemusedly even when he tasted he imagined himself triumphantly wielding weapons never inventing them somehow fantasy and hard work in a laboratory failed to come together was that movement in the rubble right at the edge of his field of vision he moved his head to one side trying to look farther in that direction if it had been movement it was stopped now he opened his mouth to speak up about it anyhowbetter safe was a motto drilled into the race from hatchlinghood back on home it usually meant avoiding annoyance or discomfort here it had more to do with preventing agony and gruesome death before he could say anything skoobs machine gun started rattling away hot brass cartridge cases clattered down onto the floor gothim skoob shouted almost as excitedly as if hed tasted ginger himself tosevite male with a rifleprobably one of the ones who was shooting at you superior sir good riddance to him nejas said the turret of the landcruiser that had taken the bomb hit swung back toward the north the landcruiser started shelling the advancing british males once more the flames that spurted from the muzzle the smoke and dirt that flew with each shellburst impressed ussmak less than they had before armed tosevites were already inside farnham sneaking toward the landcruisers like biters looking to slide needlenosed mouths between a males scales swat as you would you never could quite get rid of all of them for that you needed a spraybut here on tosev the biters were the ones with the poisonous gas clangpowfor a moment ussmak thought the main armament had fired but this jolt slewed the landcruiser sideways warning lights blazed all over the instrument panel a klaxon started to hoot loud enough to make his hearing diaphragms feel like vibrating drumheads that meant fire loose in the engine compartment in spite of everything the extinguishers could do which in turn meant the landcruiser could brew up at any moment hydrogen wasnt so enthusiastically explosive as the hydrocarbon fuels the big uglies used but it burned oh it burned all of that went through ussmaks mind far faster than conscious thought even before nejas screamed bail out ussmak had the hatch over his head open he paused only to grab his little jars of ginger stuff them into a belt pouch and almost as an afterthought pick up his personal weapon then he was scrambling up and out fast as legs and arms would propel him a rifle bullet whined past his head close enough for him to feel or imagine he felt the wind of its passage he skittered across the smooth sloping surface of the glacis plate jumped down and landed heavily on tornup asphalt the bulk of the landcruiser between him and the tosevite guns skoob already sprawled there we cant stay here he said his eyes swiveling wildly as he looked for danger every which way at once this thing is liable to go up whenever the fire gets to the ammunition or to the fuel or if that cursed big ugly sends another bomb into the fighting compartment tell me something i didnt know ussmak answered wheres the commander just then nejas jumped down on both of them blood dripped from a surprisingly neat hole in his left forearm they hit me when i started to climb out he said barely opening his mouth so as to show as little pain as he could skoob reached for a bandage but nejas waved him off we have to get clear first the commander scurried away from the hull of the stricken landcruiser keeping it between himself and the tosevites ussmak and skoob followed ussmak wanted to spray bullets back at the big uglies but that would have reminded them he was there he would sooner have had them forget all about him clangpowthe sound was quite different from outside the landcruiser but unmistakable all the same another of those springlaunched bombsussmak and his crewmates had got away just in time turning one eye backwards he saw flame race over the whole vehicle then ammunition started cooking off inside a perfect black smoke ring shot out through the opening atop the cupola the pyrotechnics finally alerted the crews of the other two landcruisers that something had gone wrong behind them they both broke off shelling the advancing british big uglies and lashed the ruins of farnham with fire trying to rout out the fighting males already sneaking through those ruins ussmak doubted they would succeed in exterminating the tosevites he was past the point of caring as long as they made the big uglies lie low long enough to let him find shelter that would do hed given up hoping for anything better than temporary respite nejas dove behind a couple of gray stone blocks that had been blasted off the wall of farnhams castle ussmak and skoob followed him to earth as if they were hunted beastswe might as well be hunted beasts ussmak thought in combat and out of his landcruiser he felt naked and soft and hideously vulnerable like some crawler cruelly torn from its shell lets see that now superior sir skoob said pointing to nejas wound nejas held out the arm his eyes wandered vaguely when he opened his mouth to speak only a wordless hiss came out the interior of his mouthparts was a pale pale pink he hadnt lost that much blood but he did not look good shock ussmak said his voice worried truth skoob said he wrapped a wound bandage around the landcruiser commanders arm i hope one of those other crews will radio for an evacuation helicopter our own set just went up in flames he turned both eyes toward nejas if we have to walk outand im afraid we willhell be a burden unless he comes out of it no rescue helicopter appeared nejas sank further into sludgy semiconsciousness ussmak grew more and more sure they would have to retreat on foot if they were going to do that they needed nejas on his legs and moving trying to carry him theyd be separately slowed and easy meat for any armed big uglies whose path they chanced to cross abandoning the landcruiser commander never crossed ussmaks mind for all hed been through he was still in some ways a welldrilled male of the race but how to get nejas up on his legs skoob was looking around helplessly perhaps for some males to lend them a hand ussmak did not think anyone would magically materialize not unless another landcruiser got killed in which case the crewmales would likely have wounded of their own he got an idea of a different sort he reached into the pouch in which hed stored his ginger took out a vial and poured some of the powdered herb into the palm of his hand skoob stared at him in astonishment he ignored the gunner holding his hand just in front of the tip of nejas muzzle he said superior sir taste this his greatest fear was that nejas was too far gone to hear him or to respond if he did but the commanders bifurcated tongue flicked out almost of itself and brought into his mouth a fairsized taste of ginger ussmak waited tensely to see if it would do any good the membranes that had fallen halfway across nejas pupils suddenly peeled back leaving the landcruiser commanders eyes bright and alert his tongue shot forth again and cleared the last of the ginger from ussmaks palm by the emperor what is that stuff he demanded whatever it is its marvelous skoob spoke before ussmak could thats the tosevite herb isnt it the one weve had so much trouble with i mean he turned one eye from nejas toward ussmak what are you doing with it possession of ginger is against regulations and subject to punishment what do you think im doing with it ussmak snapped irritated by the manifest stupidity of the question im a ginger taster thats what and it was the only thing i could think of to get the commander moving again he shifted his eyes to nejas im sorry superior sir this way we can sort things out later if i hadnt given it to you i didnt think thered be a later you were right nejas declared which silenced skoob the landcruiser commanders voice was vibrant full of life moments before his wound had left him all but unconscious now he seemed to have forgotten hed been hurt wheres my personal weapon he asked looking around for it if i can get my hands on it the three of us should be plenty to drive all the big ugly fighting males out of this damp grimy little town now skoob stared at him as if certain the ginger had robbed him of his wits and so in a way it had ussmak recognized the symptoms from his own first tastes of ginger the certainty that you could do anything regardless of the odds he still felt that when he tasted but now he knew it was the herbs illusion nejas didnt have the experience to recognize it for what it was gently ussmak said superior sir you remain yourself nothing more however powerful the herb may make you feel use logic if you can if we could not drive the big uglies from farnham from inside our landcruiser we wont do it now that the machine is wrecked we need to get out of here and get you and your wounded arm seen to ginger made you think faster than you did without it it also made you think you were thinking better than you did without it though that wasnt always so after only the briefest pause nejas said truth we must leave logic ussmak wasnt sure how clear his commanders wits really were but he wanted to get nejas moving and get all three of them out of farnham before the gingers exhilaration wore off and the first dreadful depression crashed down to take its place without warning nejas broke cover skittering southward toward another pile of rubble a bullet kicked up earth between his feet another struck sparks from the stonework behind him with a headlong leap he reached the new shelter come on he called to his crewmales nothing to it ussmak wished hed also tasted it would have helped nerve him for the dash across open empty space go on skoob said ill cover you he fired a few shots as ussmak poised sprinted dove ussmak returned the favor when skoob made the dangerous crossing from rubble to wreckage from wreckage to house they made their way south out of farnham the houses those few of them that hadnt been ruined in the fighting looked tidy and comfortable at least by tosevite standards as he scurried from one of them to the next always wondering when a bullet he never heard would hit him ussmak began to see how a big ugly who was faced with the loss of such comfort might fight hard to keep it houses thinned out and gave way to open country that worried ussmak it gave him and his crewmales fewer hiding places than theyd had in town and untold enemies could lurk behind the hedgerows that separated one miniature field from the next ussmak eyed those hedgerows with mingled fear and respect some of them had been growing for the emperor only knew how long even a landcruiser had trouble crashing through them hedgerows however were not his only concern as hed known it would nejas ginger charge wore off leaving the landcruiser commander very much a drained battery nejas slumped bonelessly to the rough asphalt of the road i cant go on he moaned aftertasting depression holding him in its teeth and even if i could what good would it do here superior sir taste this ussmak got out more ginger he didnt know if a brandnew user could stand having so much course through him but he did know the alternative was abandoning nejas hed had commanders he would have happily abandoned but nejas wasnt one of them i dont want it nejas said now he knew what ussmak was giving him but ussmak had never heard a more obvious lie nejas eyes never moved from the palm that held the ginger when ussmak brought his hand close to the other males muzzle nejas tongue flicked out and licked it clean quietly skoob said to ussmak we ought to report you for punishment when we get to an area where such things are possible do whatever youre going to do ussmak answered as weary as he ever remembered being the point is that we get to one of those places not what we do afterwards lets go nejas surged to his feet again his eyes had a hectic glow to them as if fires burned uncontrolled in his brain ussmak knew about those fires and the herbal wind that fanned them he hoped he hadnt given the commander too much ginger voice crackling with unassailable certainty nejas pointed south that way before long we shall surely encounter one of our bases intended to hold down this land unless we encounter big ugly infiltrators firstussmak thoughtif they were in farnham no reason they cant have slipped south of it theyre good at such things after all this is their planet over the days since the race came to tosev hed got a thorough education as to what that meant something moved at the bottom of a hedgerow he didnt pause to wonder about what it might be males who hesitated once seldom got the chance to hesitate twice he fired a short burst his first bullet an instant ahead of skoobs only after his finger came off the trigger did he see what he and the landcruiser gunner had been shooting at a round little spiny animal with a pointed snout it was dead now dead and torn and bleeding its tiny black eyes staring up in blind reproach for the first time since he woke up from cold sleep on tosev ussmak felt guilty about killing something mutt daniels crouched in a broken house peering out through the glassless window and down the wreckagefilled street the lizards were still moving forward between their onslaughts and the stubborn american defense chicago was being ground to meal and fine meal at that the wind that whistled through the window and through the gaping holes in the roof had a chilly edge to it the sun was going down early these days too when you could see it through the clouds both natural and of smoke never thought id be one rootin for an early winter an snow on the ground but i sure as hell am mutt muttered to himself the winter before the americans had kicked the stuffing out of the lizards who didnt seem to have a clue about fighting in the cold in the summertime thoughmutt marveled that he was still alive a noise from behind him made him whirl around his first sergeant a burly irishman named herman muldoon nodded to him and said we got some new fish comin in out of the north lieutenant replacements by jesus theyre all going to be green as paint poor lads yeah well thats one thing aint nobody can say about the likes of us mutt answered muldoons answering chuckle showed crooked teeth a couple of them broken he was a few years younger than daniels like mutt hed been over there in what had been optimistically called the war to end war as best they could figure it theyd been only a few miles apart in the argonne though they hadnt met muldoon took off his old britishstyle tin hat and ran a hand through matted hair that had been red but now was going gray he said i seen a few of em when they was back a ways christ on his cross theyve got guns theyve got helmets some of em even got uniforms they look like soldiers on the outside but inside a couple weekshell maybe inside a couple dayshalf of ems gonna end up dead i know mutt answered gloomily thats the way it works the ones who live well make soldiers out of some of em s true muldoon said s a fuckin waste but its true the real bitch of it is some o the ones who stop a bullet early would make pretty decent men if they had any luck just how you roll the dice yeah mutt said again he fell silent he didnt like thinking about that though hed seen it in france and here in illinois if chance ruled if skill played no part on the battlefield you could die any old time no matter how good a soldier youd got to be of course you could he knew that knowing it and contemplating it were two different things though a couple of hundred yards off to the left back toward lake michigan shooting started up it was just a spattering of rounds but daniels hunkered down without conscious thought muldoon said probably some of the rookies coming into the line they get up here they think they gotta start shootin mutt nodded it had been like that in france his granddadhell both his granddadshad said it was like that in the states war it had probably been like that since the day alley oop jr joined up with his dad and chucked a rock at the first dinosaur he saw more noises from the rear the firing wasnt spreading not yet daniels risked a peek back over his shoulder crawling through the wreckage of what had been a quiet north side residential neighborhood came six or eightthey werent dogfaces not yet puppyfaces maybe those faces were all dirty but only a couple of the rookies had struck up any serious acquaintance with a razor to mutts jaundiced eye they all looked too pale and too skinny down in mississippi his first guess would have been hookworm here he knew better he thumped his belly what was left of it nobodyd been eating good not this whole past yearone more reason to hate the lizards scaly hides muldoon slid back and took charge of the kids moving them into the houses to either side of the one mutt was in daniels had the heady feeling of actually being part of a real fighting line again not just a picket of a band of skirmishers that quickly went away the new fish not only wouldnt know when to shoot and when not to they wouldnt shoot worth a damn when they did open up sure as hell one of them let loose with a long burst from a tommy gun through the racketand after it abruptly fell silentdaniels listened to muldoon raking the kid over the coals you go blowin it off like that again you worthless nobrain turd and the lieutenantll chew on your ass not just me you dont ever want that to happen buddy believe me you dont mutt snorted rueful laughter as muldoon came back to him by way of a battered trench in france in it hardly would have deserved the name theyd known how to build trenches then that ran across what had been a neat urban lawn when daniels had been a noncom he too had warned privates about the fearsome wrath of their officers now he was one of those officers awesome and distant as some minorleague god he hadnt changed but when hed got his gold bar the way people looked at him had sure as the dickens the lizards worse luck werent asleep at the switch when somebody shot at them they shot back mutt didnt know if they really had all the ammo in the world but they sure as hell acted that way he threw himself flat hed return fire after the storm calmed down a thump told him muldoon had gone down on his belly too muldoon knew how things worked a couple of houses away somebody started screaming for his mother in a high broken voice mutt bit his lip one of the rookies had just found misfortune or rather it had found him he hoped the kid wasnt wounded too badly any kind of gunshot wound hurt enough and was bloody enough to scare the piss out of you even if it didnt set you pushing up daisies he looked out through a hole in the wall and saw a couple of lizards skittering forward under cover of all the lead they were laying down he fired in their direction they dove for cover he nodded to himself some ways he had more in common with the lizards these days than he did with raw recruits on his own side a buzzing in the air made him scoot back from that hole anything in the air nowadays most likely belonged to the lizards when machine guns began to yammer he congratulated himself on his own good sense and hoped none of the new fish would get killed but the machinegun bullets by the sound of them were slamming into the lizard position not his own he grinned wickedlythe scaly bastards didnt often screw up like that the aircraft whatever it was passed right overhead a bomb landed on the lizards close enough to batter his ears and make the ground shake under him even the most cautious man will take a chance every once in a while daniels wriggled forward ever so warily peeked out through the hole in the wall he burst out laughing a loud raucous noise altogether at variance with the racket of combat what the hell muldoon grunted you know what just strafed the lizards muldoon daniels held up a solemn hand to show he was telling the truth a sohelpmegod piper cub with a couple machine guns one slung under each wing got away too flew in maybe ten feet off the rooftops here or whats left of em shot up the lizards dropped that light bomb and got the hell out of there a piper cub lieutenant muldoon didnt sound as if he believed his ears jesus god we really must be scraping the bottom of the barrel i dunno about that mutt answered i heard somewheres the russians been giving the lizards fits with these little noaccount biplanes fly so low and slow theyre damn near impossible to stop until theyre right on top of youthey can do stuff a regular fighter plane cant maybe muldoon said dubiously i tell you one thing though sir you wouldnt get me up on one of those little crates not for all the tea in china hell the lizards can pick out which eye theyre gonna shoot you through no thanks not for me no way nohow not for me either daniels admitted i aint never been on an airplane an its too late for me to start now but this here aint exactly a safe line o work we done picked ourselves neither boy dont i wish you was wrong muldoon slithered up beside mutt but them lizards half the time they aint aiming at me in particular theyre just throwin bullets around and if i happen to stop one i do but if youre up there in an airplane and theyre shooting at you thatspersonal you know what i mean i guess maybe i do mutt said but a dogface who stops one of those bullets with his head hes just as dead as the red baron who got shot down all personallike muldoon didnt answer he was looking out through the hole in the wall mutt got up on one knee and peered through the window the strafing run from the piper cub had taken the wind right out of the sails of the lizards pounding of his position that made him think he could maybe do a little pounding of his own stay here and give us some coverin fire he told muldoon im gonna see if we can head south for a change stead o north at muldoons acknowledging nod daniels crawled through the trench to the ruins of the house next door the men who had dug it had broken both gas and water mains but since neither had worked for months that didnt matter a soldier he didnt recognize gave him a hand up out of the trench he pointed southward theyre hurting there lets go take us back some houses before they remember which end is up the young soldiers cheered with an intensity that made him proud and frightened at the same time theyd do whatever they thought it took the same way a young outfielder would chase a fly ball right into a fence sometimes the fence would be wood and give a little sometimes it would be concrete then theyd cart the kid off on a stretcher theyd cart a lot of these kids off on stretchers before the fight was through mutt tried not to think about that theyd carted him off on a stretcher once already now he was back he hoped hed stay in there this time come on we cant waste time here he said he told some men to move forward with him others to stay back and give covering fire the ones he told to stay back squawked and pouted like spoiled children deprived of a lollipop he held up a hand dont get in a swivet boys this herell be fire and move soon as we find cover up ahead well hunker down and start shootin so youall can move on up ahead of us youll get your share i promiseyour share of shattered skulls and splintered bones and belly wounds exploiting such eagerness filled mutt with guilt hed never again feel it himself yelling like fiends his men moved forward some shooting from the hip to add to the americans firepower and make the lizards keep their heads down mutt dove behind the burntout hulk of somebodys old packard sheet metal wouldnt keep bullets from biting him not the way a good pile of concrete or dirt would but if the lizards couldnt see him they wouldnt send as many bullets toward him a couple of men were down one twisting one ominously limp and still the lizards werent sending out the wall of lead they had before though daniels waved for the troops who had been covering to move forward past and through the detachment that had accompanied him those men in turn laid down covering fire for their buddies they did a better job than mutt had thought they had in them maybe he would be able to push the lizards out of their forward positions one lizard had other ideas hed pop up in a window like a jackinthebox squeeze off a few rounds and duck back down before anybody could nail him he was a good shot too somebody brave and stubborn and lucky like that whether human or twistyeyed alien critter could derail an advance mutt gauged the distance from himself to the house in which the lizard sheltered maybe forty yards the window the lizard was using wasnt a very big one which wasnt surprisingbeing a twistyeyed alien critter didnt make you stupid the lizard let loose with another burst off to mutts right a human voice started screaming he grimaced shook his head and took a grenade from his belt his arm had got him to the majors even if that was a long time agoand even if his lousy bat hadnt let him stay there almost without conscious thought he went into a catchers crouch in back of not the plate but the trunk of the packard he yanked the pin out of the grenade popped up knocking off his helmet with the back of one wrist as if it had been a catchers mask and let fly he went down behind the car before the grenade sailed through the window it went off with abang different from those of the rifles and submachine guns and lizard automatic weapons all around a gi dashed for that window the lizard didnt pop up to shoot him the young dogface leaned in suicidally stupid had the lizard been playing possum and fired a long burst from his tommy gun hell of a peg lieutenant he yelled little bastards raw meat now cheers rang amid the shooting move and fire move and fire and then the lizards were moving and firing too in retreat mutt ran to a corner of the house where the tough lizard had holed up fired at its buddies as they pulled back for the time being a block of ruined north side chicago was back in american hands by the hideous standards of fighting in the city that counted for a victory he owed the kids a mental apology theyd done great ttomalss wondered again how any tosevite ever lived to grow up the hatchling he was handrearing was more than half a year old it had also had a year and a half of growth inside the female who bore it it was still helpless it still had no control over its messy bodily functions the chamber in which it livedin which ttomalss perforce did most of his living toosmelled unpleasantly of stale tosevite waste several times a day ttomalss wished he had left the big ugly hatchling with the female from whose body it had so disgustingly emerged shed fought like a wild thing to keep the little squalling creature if she had had it all this time ttomalss was confident she would have been willing to hand it over to him decorated with whatever the big uglies used to signify a gift it was lying on the soft mat where it sleptwhen it slept lately ttomalss had had to install wire mesh around the mat because the hatchling hadfinallydeveloped enough neuromuscular control to roll over at this stage of their lives hatchlings of the race were aggressive little predators keeping them from hurting themselves and others counted for more than anything else in raising them the only way the tosevite could hurt itself would be to roll off a high place and fall down no hatchling of the race would have been so foolish the little big ugly looked up at ttomalss out of its dark narrow eyes its elastic face twisted into the grimace tosevites used to show amiability it kicked its arms and legs as if that added to the effect of the facial grimace most of the time it seemed sublimely unaware of its limbs though it was beginning to suspect it had hands it let out a long sequence of meaningless noises that still unnerved ttomalss every time he heard it hatchlings of the race were silent little things which made sense in evolutionary terms if you were small and quiet you were less likely to get eaten than if you were small and raucous ttomalss said to it you are the most preposterous specimen of a preposterous planet the hatchling made more burbling noises it liked him to talk to it its arms and legs kicked more then it started to whimper he knew what that meant it wanted to be picked up come here he said bending over and lifting it off the mat its head didnt flop around so loosely that it had to be supported as had been true at the onset now it could hold that big ungainly head up and look around it liked being held against his warm skin when its mouth fell onto his shoulder it started sucking as if he secreted nutrient fluid he found the wet slimy touch most unpleasant it would suck on anything its mouth could reach it would even suck when it was asleep what am i going to do with you he asked it as if it could understand males of the race often embarked on lifetime research projects but raising a tosevite up to what passed for adulthood in the species hed had something like that in mind when he took the work the job involved if it kept on being so much work for years to come ill fall over dead he told the hatchling it wiggled at the sound of his voice it was a social little thing ill fall over dead he repeated it seemed to recognize the repetition and to like it it made a noise which after a moment he recognized as a hatchlingsized version of the vocalization big uglies used for laughter ill fall over dead he said again and again the hatchling found that funnier and funnier for several repetitions laughing and squealing and kicking its feet against his chest then for whatever reason the joke wore thin the hatchling started to fuss he gave it a bottle of nutrient fluid and it gulped avidly he knew what that meant it was sucking in air along with liquid when it did that the air had to be got out of the hatchlings stomach it commonly returned along with slightly digested fluid which stank even worse than the stuff that came out the other end he was glad the hatchling seemed healthy such revolting characteristics aside the races knowledge of tosevite biochemistry and pathogens still left a great deal to be desired while the big uglies were as ignorant about that as they were about everything else save military hardware some of their notempires knew how to immunize against some of their common diseases and had begun to get the idea that there might be such things as antibiotics past that their knowledge stopped ttomalss wondered if he should give the hatchling such immunizations as the big uglies had developed the little tosevite would eventually encounter others of its own kind the big uglies had a concept called childhood diseases illnesses that were mild if a hatchling contracted them but could be serious if caught in adulthood the notion made ttomalss who had never suffered from any such misfortunes queasy but research showed the race had shared it in the earliest days of recorded history the hatchling started to wail ttomalss had heard that particular cry many times before and knew it meant genuine distress he knew what kind of distress too the air it had sucked in was distending its stomach he resignedly picked up one of the cloths used for containing bodily wastes and draped it over his shoulder come on get the air out he told the hatchling as he patted its back it twisted and writhed desperately unhappy at what it had done to itself not for the first time the big uglies feeding arrangements for their young struck him as being inefficient as well as revolting the hatchling made a noise astonishingly loud and deep for something its size it stopped thrashing a sign its distress was eased the sour odor that reached ttomalss chemoreceptors said it had indeed spit up some of the nutrient fluid hed given it he was glad hed draped himself with the cloth not only did the fluid smell bad it also dissolved his body paint he was about to lay the hatchling back on the mat when it made another noise with which he was intimately familiar a throaty grunt he felt sudden warmth against the arm under the hatchlings hindquarters with a weary hissing sigh he carried it over to the cabinet undid the fastenings that held the cloth round the hatchlings middle closed and tossed that cloth into a sealed bin along with several others hed put there that day before he could put another cloth under the hatchling it dribbled out a fair quantity of liquid waste to accompany the solid or at least semisolid waste it had just passed he mopped that off the hatchling and off the cabinet top reminding himself to disinfect the latter while he was cleaning up the hatchling almost rolled off the cabinet he caught it with a desperate lunge you are the most troublesome thing he exclaimed the hatchling squealed and made tosevite laughing noises it thought his displays of temper were very funny he noticed the skin around its anus and genitals looked red and slightly inflamed that had happened before luckily one of the races topical medications eased the problem he marveled at an organism whose wastes were toxic to its own integument his scaly hide certainly never had any such difficulties but then he told the hatchling i dont make a habit of smearing waste all over my skin the hatchling laughed its loud tosevite laugh fed deflated and cleaned it was happy as could be tired bedraggled ttomalss wished he could say the same clouds rolled across the sky more and more of them in bigger and bigger masses as the day wore on the sun peeked through in evershorter blinks ludmila gorbunova cast a wary eye upwards at any moment the autumn rain would start falling not only on pskov but all over the western soviet union with the rains would come mudthe fallrasputitsa when the mud came fighting would bog down for a while and pskov still remained in human hands she knew a certain amount of pride in that even if some of those hands were german shed done her part in the battle to hold up the lizards and the alien imperialist aggressors were not pushing attacks with the elan theyd shown the year before maybe when snow replaced rain and mud the human forces in pskov yes even the fascist beasts would show them the proper meaning of the word the lizards didnt like winter the whole world had seen that the year before she hoped this winter would bring a repetition of the pattern shed already proved akukuruznik would fly through almost anything its radial engine was aircooled she didnt have to fret about coolant turning to ice as happened in liquidcooled engines forced to endure russian winter as long as she had fuel and oil she could fly with georg schultz as her mechanic she sometimes wondered not quite jokingly whether she might not be able to fly even without fuel and oil the more he worked his magic on the little u the more she wondered how the planes shed flown had kept from falling apart before they enjoyed his ministrations she opened and closed her hands she had black dirt and grease under her nails and ground into the folds of skin on her knuckles not even a steam bath could sweat the dirt out of her she did a lot of work on her own aircraft too and knew she made a better mechanic than most russian groundcrew men but schultz had an artists touch with spanner and pliers to say nothing of an instinct for where trouble lay that made ludmila wonder if he was part biplane on his mothers side houses thinned as she walked toward the airstrip just east of pskov it lay between the city and the great forest where partisans had sheltered until they and the germans made uneasy common cause against the lizards if you didnt know where the airstrip was youd walk right past it the russian passion formaskirovka made sure of that the lizards had repeatedly bombed a dummy strip a couple of kilometers away but theyd left the real one alone thekukuruzniks all rested in shelters covered by netting with real sod laid over them more sod replaced ruts in the grass the aircraft made on takeoff and landing no sentries paced nearby though several marched at the dummy airstrip ludmila reached into her pocket and pulled out a compass she didnt trust the one on her instrument panel and wondered if some idiot groundcrew man had somehow got near it with a magnet whether or not that was so now shed have one against which to check it she had to look sharp to find the first mat that concealed a u when she did she started counting her aircraft was fifth in line she paused outside the trench in which it rested bent down leaned her head toward the mat yes someone was down in there she could hear soft muffled noises bozhemoishe whispered silently the better to preserve themaskirovka no one not even groundcrew hung around the airplanes when they werent heading out to a mission or coming back from one had the lizards managed to find a human being who would do sabotage for them here ludmila hadnt imagined such a thing was possible but then she hadnt imagined how many soviet citizens would go over to the germans either as quietly as she could she drew her pistol out of its holster then she tiptoed around to the deep end of the trench where her arrival would be least expected before she lifted up a corner of the mat she paused to listen again the noises seemed fainter here she nodded in grim satisfaction shed give the wrecker in there something to remember as long as he lived which wouldnt be long she slid under the mat and dropped down to the dirt beneath the bottom of the trench was almost three meters below ground level she landed hard but didnt try to stay on her feet if by some mischance the wrecker had a gun too a prone figure made a smaller target than an upright one it was dim and dark under the matting even so she had no trouble picking out the pale bodyno bodies there were two of them something she hadnt thought ofunder one wing of thekukuruznik they both lay on the ground too had she alerted them when she jumped down into the trench stop what youre doing she yelled at the top of her lungs swinging the muzzle of the tokarev automatic toward them only then did she realize the two bodies seemed so pale and white because she was seeing skin not clothes gott in himmelis that you ludmila vadimovna georg schultz demanded you dont want me and now you want to kill me for finding somebody else are you crazy bozhemoiludmila repeated this time quite loudly she started to giggle the giggles turned to guffaws i thought you were sabotaging thekukuruznik notnot laughter swallowed speech not funny schultz muttered he was on his feet now getting into his clothes as fast as he could so was his partner ludmilas eyes were more used to the gloom now they widened as she recognized tatiana pirogova iam sorry ludmila said speaking very quietly and taking only tiny breaths to hold mirth in check the only reason i came here was to mount a spare compass on the aircraft and she thought too much about the use of the wordmount in another context and couldnt go on tears filled her eyes as she sputtered and coughed tatiana pirogova strode up to her the blond sniper was several centimeters taller than ludmila and glared down at her if ever you speak a word of this to anyonetoanyone do you understand me i will kill you she hissed even in the dimness under the matting her blue eyes glittered dangerously your top tunic button is still undone dear ludmila answered tatianas fingers flew to it of themselves ludmila went on im not in the habit of gossiping but if you threaten me you are making a big mistake tatiana turned her back ludmila looked over to georg schultz switching to german as she did so will you please make her believe im just as glad to have you with someone else so youre not pestering me any more just thinking of that is more likely to keep me quiet than her bluster its not bluster he answered also in german that was probablyno certainlytrue tatiana with a scopemounted rifle in her hand was as deadly a soldier as any and ludmila had also seen that schultz was a viciously effective combat soldier even without his panzer wrapped around him she wondered if that shared delight in war was what had drawn him and tatiana together but shed been in enough combat herself to keep tatiana or georg schultz from intimidating her schultz spoke to tatiana in the same sort of mixture of german and russian he used to talk with ludmila tatiana angrily brushed aside his reassurances oh go away she snapped instead she went away herself slithering out from under the netting at the shallow end of the trench that hid thekukuruznik even in her fury she carefully smoothed out the net after she got free of it so as not to damage themaskirovka you might have waited another minute or two before you jumped down in here schultz said petulantly he hadnt finished then that set ludmila laughing yet again it isnt funny he growled it occurred to her then that the two of them were alone under the netting had she not had the tokarev she would have worried as things were she knew she could take care of herself yes it is she said the weight of the pistol reassuring in her hand look if you want to come down here again move one of the rocks that holds down the netting so its just off the edge instead of just on i had no idea anyone was down with the aircraft and when i did hear noise i thought it was wreckers notnot lovers somewhat mollified schultz nodded ill do that he said adding gloomily if there is a next time there probably will be ludmila surprised herself at how cynical she sounded she asked why was tatiana so upset at the idea of anyone finding out shes with you she didnt care who knew she was sleeping with the englishmanjones his name is jaschultz said but hes an englishman thats all right me im a german you may have noticed ah ludmila said it did make sense the fair tatiana used her sniping talents against the lizards these days but shed honed them against the nazis she made no secret of her continued loathing for germans in generalbut not evidently for one german in particular if word got out she would be compromised in a whole unpleasant variety of ways if she hates germans so much what does she see in you she says were both killers georg schultz shuffled his feet as if unsure whether he liked the sound of that or not as far as ludmila was concerned it not only had a lot of truth in it it also confirmed her earlier guess which made her feel clever she said wellgospodin killeryou a german would be angry if i called youtovarishch killer comrade instead of misteri think we had both better go now she was nervous as she got out from under the netting if schultz wanted to try anything that was the moment hed do it but he just emerged too and looked back toward the place where the u was hidden damnation he said i thought sure nobody would ever bother us there you never can tell ludmila said which would do as a maxim for life in general not just trying to fornicate with an attractive woman jageorg schultz grunted laughter after the fact hed evidently decided what had happened was funny too he hadnt thought so at the time nor had tatiana ludmila didnt think she would find it funny not if she lived another seventyfive years ludmila glanced over at schultz out of the corner of her eye she chuckled softly to herself though shed never say it out loud her opinion was that he and tatiana deserved each other david goldfarb sat up in the hay wagon that was taking him north through the english midlands toward nottingham to either side a couple of other men in tattered dirty uniforms of raf blue sprawled in the hay they were all blissfully asleep some of them snoring enough to give a creditable impression of a merlin fighter engine goldfarb wished he could lie back and start sawing wood too hed tried but sleep eluded him besides looking at countryside that hadnt been pounded to bits was a pleasant novelty he hadnt seen much of that sort not lately the only thing he had in common with his companions was the grubby uniforms they all wore when the lizards invaded england nobody had thought past fighting them by whatever means came to hand after bruntingthorpe got smashed up hed been made into a foot soldier and hed done his best without a word of complaint now that the northern pocket was empty of aliens and the southern one shrinking though the powers that be were once more beginning to think in terms longer than those of the moment whenever officers spied an raf man whod been dragooned into the army they pulled him out and sent him off for reassignment thus goldfarbs present situation night was coming as summer passed into autumn the hours of daylight shrank with dizzying speed even double summer time couldnt disguise that in the fields women and old men labored with horses donkeys and oxen to bring in the harvest as they might have during the wars against napoleon or against william the conqueror or against the emperor claudius people would be hungry now too as they had been then the wagon rattled past a burntout farmhouse the ground around it cratered with bombs the war had not ignored the lands north of leicester it merely had not been allconsuming here for a moment a pile of wreckage made the landscape seem familiar to goldfarb he angrily shook his head when he realized that finding a landscape familiar because the lizards had bombed it was like finding a husband familiar because he beat you some women were supposed to be downtrodden enough to do just that he thought it madness himself how long till we get to watnall he called to the driver softly so he wouldnt wake his comrades sometime tonight ah reckon the fellow answered he was a little old wizened chap who worked his jaws even when he wasnt talking goldfarb had seen that before usually it meant the chap who did it was used to chewing tobacco and couldnt stop chewing even when tobacco was no longer to be had goldfarbs stomach rumbled will you stop off to feed us any time before then he asked nay no moren ah will to feed mahself the driver said when he put it that way goldfarb didnt have the crust to argue further he rummaged in his pockets and came up with half a scone hed forgotten he had it was so stale he worried about breaking teeth on it he devoured it more by abrasion than mastication it was just enough to make his stomach growl all the more fiercely but not nearly enough to satisfy him not even after he licked the crumbs from his fingers he pointed to a cow grazing in a field why dont you stop for a bit so we can shoot that one and worry off some steaks think youre a funny bloke do you the driver said you try lookin at that cow too long and some old man like me back there in the bushes hell blow your head off for you mark mah words he hasnt kept his cow so long bein sweet and dainty ah tell you that since the driver was very likely right goldfarb shut up night fell with an almost audible thud it got cold fast he started to bury himself in the hay with his mates then had a second thought and asked the driver besides the fighter command group hq wotn ells in watnall by sounding like a cockney for three words he made a fair pun of it if the driver noticed he wasnt impressed theres nobbut the group headquarters there he answered and spat into the roadway twasnt even a village before the war how extremely depressing goldfarb said going from one accent to another for a moment there he sounded like a cambridge undergraduate he wondered how jerome jones was faring these days and then whether his fellow radarman was still alive watnalls not far from nottingham the driver said the first time since hed stepped up onto his raised seat that hed actually volunteered anything nobbut a few miles the consolation goldfarb had felt at the first sentencenottingham was a goodsized city with the promise of pubs cinemas when the power was on and people of the female persuasionwas tempered by the second if he couldnt lay hands on a bicycle a few miles in wartime with winter approaching might as well have been the far side of the moon he vanished into the hay like a dormouse curling up in its nest to hibernate one of his traveling companions still sleeping promptly stuck an elbow in his ribs he didnt care he huddled closer to the other raf man who however fractious he might have been in his sleep was also warm he fell asleep himself a few minutes later even as he was telling himself he wouldnt when he woke again something had changed in his muzziness he needed a moment to figure out what they werent moving he sat up brushing straw from his hair whats happened he asked one of the other raf men a liverpudlian whom goldfarb knew only as henry answered before the driver could were in nottingham we are theyre going tgive us some grub after all his clotted accent said he was a factory worker from a long line of factory workers jolly good goldfarb brushed at himself again trying to get as close to presentable as he could it was wasted effort because of his own disheveled state and because the night was too dark to let anyone see anything much stars glittered in a black black sky but shed little light and the moon some days past full hadnt yet risen weve soup for you lads a womans voice said out of the gloom goldfarb could make out her silhouette but no more here come take your panikins have a caretheyre hot hot the soup was and full of cabbage potatoes and carrots goldfarb didnt find any meat in his tin bowl but the broth tasted as if it had been somewhere within shouting distance of a chicken in the not too distant past sticks to your ribs that does henry said happily the other raf men made wordless noises of agreement so did the driver who was also getting outside a bowl of soup pass me back your bowls when youre done lads and well serve em out again to the next lot who come through hungry or maybe to some of our own the woman said goldfarb couldnt see her couldnt tell if she was young or old ugly or beautiful foodand even more kindnessmade him feel halfway in love with her just the same when all the bowls and spoons had been returned the driver said getalong there and the horses ambled on goldfarb called thanks back to the woman whod given them the soup as the driver had said they got into watnall in the middle of the night the transition was abrupt one minute they were rolling through open country the next in among nissen huts and maycrete buildings that seemed to have sprung from the middle of nowherewhich made a pretty fair description of watnall now that goldfarb thought on it they rattled by a couple of ackack guns whose crews jeered at them coming back to work are you at last dearies did you have a pleasant holiday bugger off goldfarb said which summed up his comrades responses pretty well too the ackack gunners laughed henry said what they were shootin at it were up in the sky and they werent in range of the bleedin lizards every minute of every bleedin day ad it right soft they did you ask me amen to that goldfarb said and the other raf men on the wagon added not only agreement but profane embellishment if you werent a pilot you were probably safer in the raf than as an infantryman you certainly lived softer in the raf than in the poor bloody infantry as you learned if you found yourself at the thin end of the wedge on the ground the way goldfarb had the driver pulled back on the reins his twohorse team stopped one of the animals bent its head and began pulling up grass taxi rides done lads the driver said he pointed you go over there now over there was a nissen hut its semicylindrical bulk black against the slightly lighter sky goldfarb scrambled down from the wagon he led the way toward the hut several of the other raf men hung back grumbling he was glad hed be returning to a job that could use his special skills any bloke could make an infantryman he opened the door and pushed his way through two blackout curtains the light inside came from candles and lanterns not electric fixtures but still seemed bright to his nightaccustomed eyes a tiredlooking flight sergeant waved him over to a desk piled high with forms all right lets see what we can do with you he said he examined goldfarbs draggled uniform youve not had the easiest time of it seems like goldfarb shrugged you do what you have to do thats the way of it the flight sergeant said nodding he pulled out a form and a short nub of pencil very goodstand and deliver goldfarb rattled off his namesurname first christian name an irony in his case middle initialrank and service number the flight sergeant wrote them down then asked and your speciality uh goldfarb im a radarman sir the flight sergeant started to write that down too then looked up sharply at goldfarb radarman somebody should have his bloody head examined turning you into a groundpounding tommy how the devil did that happen sir i was on duty south of leicester when the lizards hit my establishment we beat them back but they wrecked the place and scattered us to the four winds i fell in with some soldiers and he spread his hands you know how it is sir i was separated from my unit but i still wanted to fight and so i did the flight sergeant sighed if i had a farthing for every time ive heard that story this past fortnight id be the richest man in england sure as hell but a radarman his grin suddenly made him look younger than he had ill get a well done for coming up with you i will what was your establishment and what were you doing there i dont like to say sir goldfarb answered radar had been a secret vital to conceal from the germans when the war was young the lizards knew more about radar than any englishman was likely to learn for the next generation but old habits died hard what was your establishment and what did you do there the flight sergeant repeated with the air of a man used to cutting through multiple layers of nonsense dont waste my time the rest of the raf men stood before other desks giving out their service records goldfarb surrendered sir i was at bruntingthorpe working under group captain hipple to fit radar into meteor jets and to see what we could learn from captured lizard radars then you bloody well ought to be courtmartialed for letting anybodyand i mean up to fieldmarshals ranktake you away from what you were doing the flight sergeant said at goldfarbs alarmed expression he went on dont worry thats not going to happen but getting yourself shot up would have been a bloody waste sir bruntingthorpe had taken a hiding goldfarb said defensively i dont even know if group captain hipple is alive or dead if hes dead someone else will be minding that store the flight sergeant spoke with conviction and if everyone above you has bought his plot why then the store is yours mine goldfarb was mortified when his voice rose to a startled squeak but couldnt help it he stammered on imi dont know enough on my own i if you know more about it than anyone else who might do it itll be yours the flight sergeant said he turned to the flying officer at the desk next to his pardon me sir but ive a chap here whos not only a radarman but has also been working on a couple of what sound like most secret projects just you wait one moment the flying officer said to the aircraftman standing in front of him he grilled goldfarb for a minute or two then raised his eyes to the heavens in an expression of theatrical despair you were at bruntingthorpe you say and they drafted you into the infantry dear god in heaven i sometimes think we deserve to lose this war as punishment for our own stupidity sir after the base took a pounding i wanted to hit back at the lizards any way i could goldfarb said i wasnt drafted into the infantryi wanted to fight young man that only makes you a fool too the flying officer might possibly have been two years older than goldfarb you can do them much more damage fighting with your head than with a rifle flight sergeant get on the telephone to london ask them where the most fitting possible billet for your man is then see that he gets to it he gave his attention back to the patiently waiting aircraftman do carry on you were saying landing gear was your maintenance speciality you come with me the flight sergeant told goldfarb rising from his desk goldfarb came you can ring up london he asked following the other raf man out into the night i thought all telephone lines were long since wrecked all the civilian ones are and likely to stay so the flight sergeant answered you want to be careful here if you step off the path youll be ankledeep in muck cant very well run a military outfit though without being able to talk back and forth eh i suppose not goldfarb couldnt see the path he wasnt supposed to step off of which gave each step a certain feeling of adventure he went on it must have been a bit dicey while the lizards stood between here and london oh it was the flight sergeant agreed cheerily we were cut off a couple of times as a matter of fact but groundlaid cable is not what youd call conspicuous and we managed to infiltrate men to make repairs the couple of times it did get broken ah here we are he opened the door to a maycrete building whose walls were already beginning to crumble even though theyd been up for only a couple of years after the usual pair of blackout curtains he and goldfarb went into a stuffy little room where a corporal sat relaxing by what looked like a fanciedup version of an ordinary field telephone the corporal nodded to the flight sergeant ello fred he said dropping his aitches like the lowerclass londoner he undoubtedly was oos this bloke wiv yer flying officer says weve got to ring up london figure out what the devil to do with him the flight sergeantfredanswered get them on the horn for me would you right yare the corporal vigorously turned the crank on the side of the telephone then picked up the handset goldfarb watched the process with interest any new gadget fascinated him and he hadnt seen this model telephone before he wished he could ask questions but the corporal was intent on his task suddenly the fellow grinned and began to talk ello darlin i was opin youd be on tonight ows tricks chat her up another time nigel fred said dryly this is business the corporal nodded saying listen love put me throughit came outfrew to the blokes in personnel would you thats a lambwe got us a square peg wot wants a round ole he waited then passed the handset to the flight sergeant fred told goldfarbs story to whoever was on the other end in london the longer he talked the more excited he sounded and the more details he asked of goldfarb very good sir thank you sir he said at last ill see that hes sent on there straightway he hung up sent on where goldfarb asked dover the flight sergeant answered the lizards never got that far and i gather something which may interest you is going on there though they wouldnt tell mewhats so funny nothing sir not really goldfarb said hed been thinking of a song from an american film hed seen back before the war began a catchy number called california here i come after all this time hed be right back where he started from barbara yeager folded her hands over her belly more forcefully than a shout the wordless gesture reminded sam she was pregnant after not showing for what seemed a very long time these past couple of months shed ballooned a couple of months more and hed be a father i wish you werent going away barbara said she was a trouper that was as close as she would come to reminding him things didnt always work out exactly as planned just because the baby was due around christmastime didnt mean it had to wait that long he shrugged they gave me my orders hon its not like i have a whole lot of choice he patted the stripes on his shirtsleeve you dont fool me one bit sam yeager barbara said laughing at him maybe theyd been married only seven months or so but she read him like a book youre champing at the bit and you know it you and your pulp fiction she said it affectionately so it didnt sting or not much but hed heard similar noises from so many people that his response sounded more nettled than it was its science fiction not just any pulp fiction and with the lizards here its not fiction any more its the straight goods same as what the met lab was working on they were alone in their room but he didnt mention atomic bombs by name barbara spread her hands thats all true and i admit every word of it but youre as excited about working with a real live spaceship as a little kid would be with an allday sucker well what if i am he said yielding the point i earned this chance and i want to make the most of it if i do a good job here the way i did with the work on that lightamplifier gadget maybejust maybetheyll turn me into an officer and thats not minor league at all i spent too much time in the bushes babei want to hit the bigs i know barbara answered i think thats goodi think its better than good as a matter of fact but as i said you cant fool me if we start building spaceships of our own you want to ride one dont you sam hugged her the way her belly pressed against his reminded him again of the child growing within her he said having a wife who understands me is a darn good thing sure id love that if it ever happens and the only way it will is if i get real good at talking with the lizards about how rockets work and what youre supposed to do with em i dont have the education to know how to make em myself or the trainingand the reflexesto be a pilot i understand all that she said and kissed him fiercely and im proud of you for it and i love you for working hard to make something of yourselfand i wish you werent going but ive got to he started to show her his wristwatch before he could somebody knocked on the door he quickly kissed her ive got to go now hon she nodded he opened the door standing in the hall were an army major and a lizard with pretty fancy body paint morning yeager the major said he wore hornrimmed glasses and a thin sandy mustache the name tag above his right breast pocket saidtompkins morning sir the major glanced toward the lizard and youll know vesstil i expectstrahas pilot for his flight down here oh sure sam shifted into the lizards language in the name of the emperor i greet you and wish you health every time he talked with a male of the race he was reminded of just how informal a language english was hed never thought about that till he started picking up lizard talk i return your wishes in the emperors name vesstil said in fair english even using english he lowered his eyes at the mention of his sovereign okay lets go tompkins sounded like a man in a hurry yeager waved to barbara one last time and set off behind him to vesstil tompkins said we have clothes downstairs for you to make you look like a human being if your friends upstairs are watching they are not my friends not now the lizard pilot said if they were my friends i should not be here assisting you the remark held an unmistakable note of reproof sam wondered if tompkins heard it a lizard in trousers and shirt and widebrimmed hat could not help looking anything but ridiculous not at close range from the air though hed seem just another big ugly which was the point of the exercise he and his human companions got into a buckboard a driver dressed like a hayseed clucked to the horses and flicked the reins the wagon rattled off wed go faster if we were riding horses sam said we would if vesstil here could ride one anyway he translated the remark for the lizards benefit i am willing to teach you how to fly the shuttlecraft the race has made vesstil said with dignity i am not willing to learn to barbarously balance myself on the back of a beast these creatures strike me as being more dangerous than flying between the stars which is but a matter of routine beasts are unpredictable by the way he said it that was an inexpiable sin they were on the road north for several days the highways held little traffic and all of it drawn by horses or mules yeager felt transported back into the days of his fathers youth once they passed out of the pine woods and into those where broadleafed trees predominated the fiery colors of autumn replaced green they interested vesstil none of the humans in the wagon could explain why the leaves changed color every year a sign on us said theyd just passed from arkansas up into missouri theyd also passed into what looked as if it had been one hell of a forest fire not so long ago yeager wondered if it had started when the rocket shipthe shuttlecraft vesstil called itlanded he turned to tompkins and said sir how do you go about hiding a shuttlecraft youll see when we get there the major answered and set a finger alongside his nose sam didnt know what to make of that but he kept quiet before long the wagon was jolting down winding country roads and then along unpaved tracks that would turn into hubdeep glue at the first good rain off in the distance yeager saw what looked like the wreckage of the biggest tent in the world about half a mile farther on he spotted another enormous canvas big top this one with a couple of bomb craters close by the proverbial cartoon lightbulb went on above his head we built so many tents the lizards never figured out which one had the pea under it well actually they did tompkins said but by the time they did wed managed to strip it pretty completely they manufacture these critters the same way we do chevvies except maybe even bettereverything comes apart real easy so you can work on it if you have to how else would you build something vesstil asked youd be amazed major tompkins answered rolling his eyes behind the hornrims your people have had a long long time to learn to do everything the smooth way the easy way the efficient way its not like that with us a lot of the stuff were doing now were doing for the very first time we arent always as good at it as we might be and we make a lot of dumb mistakes but one way or another we get it done this the race has learned often to its sorrow vesstil made one of the leakykettle noises lizards used when they were thinking hard the shiplord straha my commander that was has this trait also in larger measure at least than is usual for a male of the race because the fleetlord would not heed him he decided to join his fate to you and yet straha had had kittens about unauthorized bodypaint designs even a radical lizard sam thought was a reactionary by human standards he said i dont really get to go aboard a real live spaceship then too bad even working with the parts will be pretty good though a question if i may vesstil said how does your english have a word for spaceship and the idea of a spaceship without having the spaceship itself does not the word follow the thing it describes not always not with us yeager answered with a certain amount of pride we have something called science fiction that means stories that imagine what well be able to build when we know more than we do now people who write those stories sometimes have to invent new words or use old ones in new ways to get across the new things or ideas theyre talking about you tosevites you imagine too much and you move too fast to make what you imagine realso the race would say vesstil answered with a sniffy hiss change needs study notstories he hissed again sam felt like laughing or possibly pounding his head against the side of the buckboard of all the thingshed never imagined a lizard sneering at the concept of science fiction stood high on the list they came to a little hamlet called couch yeager had been in a lot of little backwoods towns before hed waited for the locals to give them the suspicious onceover hed got more times than he could count having vesstil along should have made things worse but the couchians or couchites or whatever they were went about their business sam wondered how many visiting firemen had come to look over the spaceship enough to get them used to the idea of strangers anyway the driver pulled up at a general store across the street from a big shed much the largest building in town yeager wondered what it had been for curing tobacco maybe it had that look but to his surprise tompkins didnt take them over to the shed instead they walked into the general store the fellow behind the counter was on the scrawny side and had a scraggly gray beard those details and some bare shelves aside he and his store might have been pulled out of a norman rockwell painting and set in motion mornin he said with the hillbilly twang yeager had heard from players in ballparks scattered all across the country morning terence major tompkins answered mind if we use your back room terence hell of a namesam thought shook his head before the major could lead yeager and vesstil through the door to the back room it opened and three men came out into the store sam stared he knew he was staring but he couldnt help it of all the people he never would have expected to see in a smalltown general store albert einstein ranked high on the listso high in fact that he needed a moment to realize one of the physicists companions was benito mussolini complete with the enormous concrete jaw that showed up in all the newsreels einstein eyed vesstil with the same fascination yeager felt towardhim then the third man of the group spoke to tompkins bobs still back there hes the one youll want to see isnt he major yes general eisenhower the major answered by then yeager had given up staring when you got to the point where a mere generals company made him not worth noticing till he opened his mouth youd come a hell of a long way from the threei league eisenhower shepherded his vips out of the general store tompkins shepherded his notsovips into the backroom terence the storekeeper took everything in stride the back room had a trapdoor set into the floor as soon as he saw it yeager figured out what was going on sure enough it led not to a basement but to a tunnel formidably shored up with timber tompkins carried an oldfashioned lantern to light the way the lantern might once have burned kerosene but now the smell of hot fat came from it the tunnel came out inside the shed as sam had expected it would the interior of the building did smell powerfully of tobacco though none was curing there now sam sighed he still missed cigarettes even if his wind was better these days than it had been for the past ten years but he forgot all about his longing when he looked around these tanks and lines and valves and unnamable gadgets had come out of a veritable spaceship vesstil had flown down from outer space to the surface of the earth if people could figure out how to duplicate themand the frame in which theyd flownspace travel would turn real for mankind too prowling among the disassembled pieces of the lizard shuttlecraft was a tall grayhaired man with slightly stooped shoulders and a long thoughtful face come on over with meill introduce you tompkins said to sam nodding to the tall man he said sir this is sergeant sam yeager one of our best interpreters yeager id like you to meet robert goddard we filched him from the navy when vesstil brought straha down in the shuttlecraft he knows more about rockets than anyone around im very pleased to meet you sir yeager said sticking out his hand ive read about your work inastounding goodwe wont be starting from scratch with you then goddard said with an encouraging smile he was somewhere in his fifties yeager thought but not very healthy or maybe like so many people just working himself to death he went on hankyour major tompkinsis too kind a good many germans know more about this business than i do theyve made big ones ive just made small ones but the principles stay the same yes sir yeager said can we buildone of these he waved at the collection of hardware the mechanical parts we can matchor at least we can make equivalents for them goddard said confidently then he frowned the electric lines we can also match the electronic controls are another matter altogether there our friends herehe nodded to vesstilare years maybe centuries ahead of us working around that will be the tricky part yes sir sam repeated what will you want me to do sir youre supposed to be a hot translator arent you youll run questions and answers back and forth between me and vesstil between what we already know and what he can tell usitll be a while before we get spaceships of our own i expect but even big rockets like the ones the germans have would help us a lot hitting the lizards from a couple of hundred miles away is a lot better than going at em facetoface thats true sir sam wondered how big a rocket would have to be to carry an atomic bomb he didnt ask vesstil had no business hearing of such things and he didnt know whether goddard was cleared for them either he laughed a little the united states didnt have a big rocket and it didnt have atomic bombs eitherand here he was putting the two together from everything hed seen of the lizards they didnt make leaps of imagination like thatwhich was why human beings still had a chance to win this war nieh hoting glowered at liu han you are the most exasperating woman in the history of the world he snarled liu han smiled back across the table at the dingy peking rooming house she sipped tea nibbled at a rice cake and said nothing shed been saying nothing ever since shed let him know she had a good idea weeks before he still had no notion what her idea was shed wanted to keep more control over it than he was willing to give basically she wanted to become one of the leaders in the communists peking underground nieh hadnt been willing to pay that kind of price beside him hsia shoutao laughed raucously you sound like youre in love with her for heavens sake he said nieh glowered at him too hsia thought of everything in terms of his crotch not economics but he also thought he knew how to get what he wanted if she wont open up we can always liquidate her no one would miss her thats certain nieh glanced over to liu han to see if the threat had put her in fear he didnt think it had and he was expert in gauging such things she said if you kill me you will never find out what i have in mind we dont have to kill you hsia said his voice all the more frightening because he sounded so genial all we have to do is hurt you for a while do what you want with me liu han said but who will trust you with his ideas if you torture me that made nieh wince mao had written that guerrillas should be like a fish concealed within the school of the people if they scared the people away from them they would stand alone and exposed to the wrath of the little scaly devils sighing he made his first retreat i will give you what you ask but only if i think your idea is good enough then you will tell me you think it is bad ignore me and use it anyhow liu han said i could do that now make all the promises in the world and then break them nieh hoting reminded her if you want your idea used against the little devils sooner or later you will have to tell me what it is and if you want your reward you will have to trust a promise that you will get it liu han looked thoughtful when he was through but then she said any time anyone has promised me anythingmen and little scaly devils bothits turned out to be a lie why should you be any different because we are comrades in a fight against the same enemy nieh answered if you show me a way to hurt the scaly devils youwill be rewarded the peoples liberation army does not exploit the women who fight side by side with their sons fathers husbands and brothers he kicked hsia shoutao under the table he had spoken sound doctrine and wished hsia were better at living up to it hsia for a wonder kept his mouth shut and after keeping silent so long liu han at last wavered i wish i could do this on my own she muttered then i wouldnt have to believe another pack of lies but if i want to hurt the little devilsand i doi need help so she talked for some time the longer nieh hoting listened to her lowvoiced description of what she had in mind the more impressed he got hsia shoutao said a beast show in disparaging tones but nieh kicked him again he wanted to hear every word of this when liu han finished he dipped his head to her and said i think you may deserve everything you have been saying you wanted for so long if it works as it should this will let us get in among the scaly devils to spy certainly and maybe as you say to kill that is what i want liu han said i want the little devils to know i did it to them too they will know my name it is in their records and the machines that think for them will find it they stole my child my tiny daughter maybe i can force them to give her back nieh hoting sent her a severe look and if they returned the child to you you would abandon the campaign against the scaly imperialist aggressors he demanded if she said yes to that he would throw her out of the rooming house and think hard about having her liquidated the dialectic of the class struggle was more important than merely personal concerns but liu han shook her head nothing would make me stop fighting the little scaly devils i owe them too much for that you communists seem to be doing more to fight them than anyone except maybe the japanese and i hate the eastern devils too so i will work with you whether or not i have my childbut i want her back good enough nieh said relaxing injuries suffered at the hands of oppressors often led folk to the peoples liberation army once they learned the true doctrines the communist party espoused they were likely to remain loyal members all their lives and to be eager to help others escape from similar maltreatment liu han said our best chance to smuggle weapons and explosives in amongst the little scaly devils i think is to use the men who display dung beetles and mice the scaly devils i have seen are squeamish about these little creatures they will not search the containers that carry them as thoroughly as they would if something else were inside that is a very good thought nieh said that is avery good thought hsia shoutao echoed he looked at liu han as if hed never seen her before perhaps he hadnt in any real sense of the word he certainly hadnt taken her seriously until this moment the idea has one weakness nieh hoting said if the scaly devils search only by hand we shall defeat them and yours is a good way to do it but if they use the machines that see into things we shall be discovered that is true of any scheme for bringing weapons in among the little devils liu han said nieh hoting nodded she was right two weaknesses hsia said the other is that those who will use the guns and grenades probably will not come out alive it is hard to find men willing to die like that every time you use them up too finding more like them gets harder do not tell the men giving the shows what were loading in among their creatures liu han said nieh and hsia both laughed youre ruthless enough thats plain nieh said but bombs and grenades arent light and are bulky they would know the containers for their beetles or mice had been altered they would not know why though liu han answered if the explosives were in a metal case painted black we could say it was one of the scaly devils machines for making the films that they show on their little cinema screens the animalshow men will be honored to believe that and they probably will not ask the little devils about it nieh and hsia shoutao looked at each other this woman has the spirit of a peoples commissar in her nieh hoting said admiringly maybe she does maybe she does hsia said he leered at liu han across the table she has other assets too nieh wished hsia would stop evaluating women principally on how beddable they were he too had noticed that liu han was far from badlooking but that did not mean he thought she was beddable he had the idea that any man who tried to force his way through her jade gate was likely to end up a eunuch like one of those who had served at the court of the old corrupt ching emperors if hsia wasnt smart enough to realize as much he might have to find out the hard way you have the idea nowive given it to you liu han said sounding unsure whether or not that had been wise now to use it now to use it nieh hoting agreed first we need to find the animalshow men we will need and to get them to cooperate with us then we have to spread this idea far and wide throughout china we need to learn of some great holiday the little scaly devils will be celebrating and to attack them in many places at the same time each time we come up with a way to get inside their quarters we can only use it once we want to wring the most advantage we can from this yes liu han said that would be a good beginning to my revenge nieh sipped tea as he studied her a good beginning to her revenge most people would have been satisfied with that as the whole of it he nodded thoughtfully the demands shed made of him before she would reveal her idea seemed more and more reasonable even if she was a woman she had a soldiers ruthless spirit he lifted the handleless cup in salute to her to the peoples revolution and to liberation from all oppression he said loudly she smiled at him and drank to the toast a new idea slid through his mind if a woman was already a revolutionary did that not give wanting her a sound ideological basis it was he told himself purely a theoretical question had he not already told himself liu han was not beddable he glanced her way again it was a pity the freighter drew close to new york city vyacheslav molotov stared at the great towers with loathing and envy he concealed behind his usual expressionless facade as he had when he visited hitler in berlin he felt he was entering a citadel of the enemy of everything he and the soviet union stood for molotov on wall street if that wasnt an actingout of the struggle inherent in the historical dialectic he didnt know what was and yet just as fascist germany and the soviet union had found common cause a few years before so now the soviet union and the united states already allies against hitlerism joined forces against a worse invader when you looked at life without the dialectic to give it perspective it could be very strange pointing ahead to the arrogant decadent skyline molotovs interpreter said the americans have taken their share of damage in this war comrade foreign commissar so they have molotov said most of the glass in the windows of the tall thrusting skyscrapers had been shattered black scorchmarks running up the sides of the buildings showed where fires had blazed out of control a couple leaned drunkenly to one side as if unlikely to stand much longer molotov surveyed the scene with a cold eye then added only fit that they be reminded they are in a war against the germans they did the building and we did the dying a tugboat came puffing out to greet the freighter a man with a megaphone stood at the bow and bellowed something in english the interpreter translated he says ahoy lithuanian ship youre a long way from home this i believe is intended as a joke heh heh molotov said just like that hed forgotten his vessel still flew the extinct gold green and red banner of what was now and rightfully the lithuanian soviet socialist republic he also managed to forget that the lithuanian soviet socialist republic had been under nazi occupation till the lizards came and still showed no delight at the prospect of bowing to the authority of moscow how shall i reply the interpreter asked molotov was tempted to send the american greetings in the name of the lithuanian congress of peoples deputies but refrained tell him i greet him in the name of the soviet people and of general secretary stalin more shouts in english the interpreter said this time he replies correctly he says we are to let him assist us in berthing then we shall do so molotov answered take this up with the ships officers not with me i had thought they might bring proper diplomatic personnel to meet with us here but if this is not the case we shall proceed into new york he spoke as if he were about to enter some jungle filled with wild and savage tribesmen that was how he felt to him capitalists were no more than predatory wild beasts and new york their principal lair following the lead of the tug the freighter sailed into the east river the battered ship left behind the statue of liberty standing tall and proud on bedloes island molotov had nothing in principle against the ideals the statue epitomized but thought the united states with its exploitation of negroes by whites of poor by rich of proletarians by capitalists which was not quite the same thing did a poor job of living up to them the freighter tied up at pier quite near the shore the interpreter pointed to a sign in english comrade foreign commissar do you know what there is between this and pier the next one over he said his voice quivering with indignation there is what is called the municipal skyport where the rich capitalists can land their private seaplanes conveniently close to their wall street offices that any man should be rich enough to own his own seaplane molotov shook his head how many men went hungry so a handful could afford these useless luxuries but he had not come here to mock the capitalists he had come to deal with them hed dealt with the nazis he could stand this he looked around at the bustling activity on the docks even invaded america remained formidably productive and economically strong he even saw some petrolpowered lorries hauling goods away once theyd been taken off their ships back in the ussr every drop of petrol and diesel fuel went directly to the war effort to tanks and airplanes donkeys and horses and strong backs hauled goods from one place to another waiting on the pier was not a taxicab as hed half expected but a horsedrawn buggy of american design molotov was not insulted at failing to rate a motorcar of his own the lizards had a habit of strafing automobiles on the assumption that whoever was in them was liable to be important as a result people who were genuinely important traveled for the most part in horsedrawn conveyances like everyone else when molotov and his interpreter climbed aboard the carriage the driver surprised him by greeting him in good russiandobry den gospodin molotov good day to you as well but i amtovarishch molotov if you please the foreign commissar answeredgospodin was what you would have called an aristocrat before the revolution the simplecomrade showed proper egalitarianism however you like the driver said equably enough molotov did not think him a native russianspeaker he had a trace of the sibilant accent english gave to russian perhaps his parents had come to the united states and hed learned his ancestral language from themor he could have been an american whod studied russian thoroughly as molotovs interpreter had studied english the interpreter leaned forward in his seat as the carriage began rolling he looked petulant molotov understood that if the interpreter was not useful he would soon be performing a function where he was most likely a function that involved carrying a rifle living on whatever he could scrounge and trying to survive against superior lizard firepower you are going to the subtreasury building comrade foreign commissar the driver said our first president george washington took his oath of office in front of the old city hall that used to stand there inside in a glass case is the very stone he stood on how interesting molotov lied comrade foreign commissar the interpreter said hoarsely pointing to a sign on a corner we are traveling down wall street at this very moment he looked around in alarm as if he expected an assault from a regiment of swagbellied plutocrats in toppers cutaways and spats each one sporting a diamond ring bigger than the last and puffing a fat cigar molotov looked around too some of the people on the fabled street did wear business suits but more were in workmens clothes or uniforms they didnt look quite so shabby as men on the street in warravaged moscow but they didnt seem wildly wealthy or even prosperous either in a helpful tone of voice the driver said the subtreasury building is right across the street from the new york stock exchange had molotovs interpreter had an apotropaic amulet he would have taken it out and brandished it at the mention of that tool of the soviets ideological devil the subtreasury building was a dignified structure in the greek revival style of the previous century to molotov for whom socialist realism was as much an article of faith as the doctrine of the incarnation was to pope pius xii having a building pretend to be something it wasnt summed up the dishonesty of the capitalist system that the skyscrapers along wall street dwarfed the subtreasury building told him everything he needed to know about where economic power in the united states really lay a bronze statue of a man in outmoded clothing stood on the steps as molotov went past it his interpreter said there is george washington the first president of the united states molotov dismissed the first president in half a dozen words he is dressed like an aristocrat the offhand condemnation made the man who had driven him to the subtreasury building mutter something under his breath behind the impassive mask molotov always wore he chuckled to himself inside a smiling flunky led him and the interpreter to a large airy welllit chamber the men waiting behind the tables there rose politely as he came in good morning comrade foreign commissar cordell hull said excellent to see you again i am pleased to have this opportunity to consult with my allies in the joint struggle against the imperialist aggressors from the stars molotov answered keeping any dealing on a personal level to a minimum it is also good to have representatives of great britain here after the heroic resistance her people have shown against the aliens invading forces do you know lord beaverbrook and lord halifax the american secretary of state asked i had the honor of meeting lord beaverbrook in moscow two years ago when he headed the angloamerican mission on sending aid to the soviet union after the unprovoked and perfidious fascist attack molotov said nodding to the present british minister of supply good to see you again molotov lord beaverbrook said sticking out his hand he was a tall ruddy balding man in his midsixties with a shrewd bluntfeatured face and an air of energy that would have done credit to someone half his age you will introduce me to lord halifax molotov said we have never met in the flesh what he did know about halifax he did not fancy the british ambassador to the united states had been foreign secretary under neville chamberlain before war broke out and during most of its first year till the chamberlain government fell in the aftermath of disasters in scandinavia the low countries and france all through his time in office hed advocated appeasing the hitlerite beast by tossing one country after another into its ravening maw now though he nodded civilly to molotov and extended his right hand the left sleeve of his coat hung limp his left arm had been withered from birth and lacked a hand a pleasure to meet you at last he murmured indeed molotov said looking up at him he was taller and balder than beaverbrookhe had to be within a few centimeters of two meters tall most men though were taller than molotov he refused to let that or anything else intimidate him now that we have dealt with the formalities shall we move on to the business at hand yes yes by all means with his own hands cordell hull pulled out a chair for molotov and then another for his interpreter molotov felt faintly scandalized that was not proper work for a man whose rank matched his own the american passion for showing equality of upper and lower classes evensometimes especiallywhere that equality did not in truth exist always struck him as hypocritical but diplomacy without hypocrisy was almost a contradiction in terms molotov said let us review the present state of our alliance and plan our future moves against the common foe not all such planning is practicable lord beaverbrook put in the damned lizards have plans of their own as we found out to our sorrow this past summer we were invaded first by the nazis then by the lizards molotov said we know in great detail what you have experienced russia being a large state lord halifax began molotov corrected him with icy precision the soviet union being a large state yes quite er the soviet union being a large state lord halifax resumed you enjoyed the luxury of trading space for time which allowed you more strategic options than were available to us thus your immediate use of poison gas molotov said yes that like our bomb from explosive metal does seem to have been something which found the lizards illprepared he watched halifax and beaverbrook preen as if theyd been personally responsible for throwing mustard gas at the lizards maybe beaverbrook actually had had something to do with the decision hed been active in weapons development molotov reckoned poison gas an altogether mixed blessing not long after the english started using it the germans also dida more lethal species too and the germans had rockets to throw their gas farther than they could directly reach not for the first time molotov was glad the lizards had landed in poland he would have liked their landing in germany even better the nazis poison gas also seemed to be on beaverbrooks mind for he said technical cooperation among the allies is still not all it might be we have yet to receive from berlin you wont get anything from berlin any more than you would from washington cordell hull said or tokyo either come to that from the germans i should say lord beaverbrook replied ahem weve not received from the germans the specifics of their new suffocating gas nor indeed any word from them on their progress toward nuclear weapons for some time we and they were enemies before our present alliance with them is nothing more than a convenience molotov said we should not be surprised when it creaks the angloamericansoviet alliance against the hitlerites had also been one of convenience as had the nazisoviet pact before that you didnt stay wedded to an alliance because it was there you stayed because it was useful for you what had austria said refusing to help russia during the crimean war after the romanovs rescued the hapsburg throne we shall astonish the world by our ingratitudesomething like that if you were in the game you knew it had slippery rules the british had some clues along those lines molotov wondered about the americans though because he still worried about the germans almost as much as he did about the lizards molotov said we have reports that the nazis will be ready to begin using those bombs next spring he didnt say hed heard that himself straight from ribbentrops mouth the united states and britain endangered the future of the soviet union hardly less than the nazis we can match that cordell hull said placidly we may even beat it that was more than molotov had heard from ribbentrop he wondered if it was more than ribbentrop knew for that matter he was always amazed when ribbentrop knew anything if that is so the war against the lizards will take on an entirely different tone he observed so it will hull said you russians should have more of these weapons coming up soon too shouldnt you so we should molotov let it go at that unfortunately just because the soviet union should have had more explosivemetal bombs coming into production didnt mean itwould have them he wondered how long the physicists would have before stalin started liquidating them out of frustration the great stalins virtues were multifarioushe would tell you as much himself patience however was not among them lord halifax said if we show the lizards we are their match in destructive power my hope is that we shall then be able to negotiate a just and equitable peace with them once an appeaser always an appeasermolotov thoughtmy hope is that we shall drive them off our world altogether he said then the historical dialectic can resume from the point where it was interruptedand its processes can finish throwing britain onto the rubbish heap that would not be easy under the best of circumstances lord beaverbrook said and circumstances are not of the best the lizards as you will probably recall have a colonization fleet traveling toward earth much as themayflower brought englishmen and women to what we then called the new world will their military forces flee leaving the colonists nowhere to land i think not molotov hadnt considered it from that perspective he was certain stalin hadnt either and yet it made sense even in dialectical terms the lizards were imperialists so much was obvious but what did the imperialists do they didnt just conquer locals they also established coloniesand would fight to protect what they saw as their right to do so slowly he said i do not wish to accept the permanent presence of these aliens on our world i daresay the red indians werent overjoyed at the prospect of pilgrim neighbors either beaverbrook answered we must first make certain we arent simply overwhelmed as they were thats an important point cordell hull said and one of the reasons the indians got overwhelmed is that they neveror not often enough anywayput up a common fight against the white men if a tribe had another tribe next door for an enemy they wouldnt think twice about joining with the new settlers to clear em out and then a few years later it would be their turn and they probably wondered what the devil happened to them we cant afford that and we have to remember it no matter how bad we think our neighbors are living under the lizards would be a damn sight worse molotov thought not of red indians but of the tsars expanding russian might at the expense of the nomads of the steppe and the principalities in the caucasus the principle though remained the same and hull was right all the worlds leaders even the great stalin needed to remember it i shall convey your thoughts and my agreement with them to the general secretary molotov said cordell hull beamed thank you comrade foreign commissar i hope you wont mind my saying that this is i believe the first time youve expressed a personal opinion in all our talks molotov considered slowly he nodded you are correct mr secretary he said i apologize for the error it was inadvertent i assure you heinrich jager accepted three francs in change from a shopkeeper after he bought a couple of meters of twine two were solid prewar coins the third instead of marianne on the obverse had a doubleheaded axe two stalks of wheat and the legendetat francais it was made of aluminum and felt weightless in his hand the shopkeeper must have noticed the sour stare he sent the franc vichy says we have to use them the fellow said with a shrug so do the lizards jager just shrugged and stuck the coin in his pocket the less he had to put his halting french on display in albi the happier he was he and otto skorzeny had already been here longer than they wanted other raids skorzeny planned had run like clockwork here the clock was slow he rolled up his twine and walked out of the shop onto the avenue du marechal foch as always when he looked about in albi a line from some english poet sprang to mind a rosered city half as old as time pink and red brickwork predominated hereabouts though brown and muddy yellow added to the blend if oneor here twohad to rusticate there were worse places than albi in which to do it the aluminum coin from marshal petains mint went when he bought a kilo ofharicots verts he carried the beans back to the flat he and skorzeny were sharing he hoped his comrade in arms hadnt brought home another tart when skorzeny had a mission directly before him he was all business when he didnt his attention wandered and he needed something else to keep him interested in the world hed also been drinking an ungodly lot lately but when jager got back to the flat he found skorzeny alone sober and beaming from ear to ear guess what the big ss man boomed good old uncle henri finally shipped us the last piece we need to put our toy together did he thats firstrate jager said a mortar was not an impressivelooking piece of lethal hardware especially disassembled a sheetmetal tube an iron base plate three legs for the tripod and some straps and screws and a sight any individual component could go through the stillfunctional mails of vichy france without raising a gallic eyebrow but now that the base plate had finally come they could turn everything back into a mortar in a matter of minutes lets go do it now skorzeny said excitedly in daylight jager shook his head that idea still appalled him the plant runs three shifts well do just as much damage if we hit it at night and well have a better chance of getting away clean sometimes jager youre a bore skorzeny said sometimes skorzeny youre a crazy man jager retorted hed long since learned that you couldnt let skorzeny grab any advantage no matter how tiny if you did hed ride roughshod over you the only thing he took seriously was a will whose strength matched that of his own and god hadnt turned out a whole lot of those now skorzeny laughed a raucous note that filled the little furnished flat a crazy man maybe i am but i have fun and the lizards dont theyll have even less fun once were through with them jager said shall we walk by the factory one last time make sure were not overlooking anything now youre talking the prospect of action of facing danger always got skorzenys juices flowing lets go first smear that glop over your scar jager said as he did whenever skorzeny was about to go out in public in albi the lizards were terrible at telling people apart but that scar and the ss mans size made him stand out they made him stand out for human collaborators too bore skorzeny repeated but he rubbed the brown makeup paste over his cheek it left him looking as if his face had been burned but the lizards werent looking for a man with a burn they were after a man with a scarand they wont be shy about snapping up any friends he has along eitherjager thought baggy trousers a tweed jacket a cloth cap to jager they made skorzeny look like a german in downattheheels french clothes rather than a downattheheels frenchman but he did know the lizards were a less demanding audience he thought the beret he wore made him look dashing skorzeny insisted it looked like a cowflop on his head he took the chaffing in good part wearing a beret in france these days meant you supported vichy which was exactly the impression he was trying to create the factory was on the rue de la croixverte in the northeastern part of the city jager and skorzeny walked past the theater and the jardin national on their way to it they ambled along hands in their pockets as if they had all the time in the world skorzeny gave a pretty girl the eye she stuck her nose in the air ignoring him with gallic panache he laughed as raucously as he had back in the apartment a stream of lorries rolled out of the gasmask plant as the two germans came up to it the lorries headed off to the east to help save lizards from german gas the factory itself was a large nondescript building of orange brick utterly unremarkable from the outside only the lizard guards who paced its perimeter with automatic rifles made it seem at all important jager didnt even turn his head toward it he just glanced at it out of the corner of his eyes as he mooched on past as for skorzeny he might not even have suspected the place existed let alone that it manufactured goods which hurt thereich he was pompous and arrogant no doubt about that but a mission made him all business he and jager bought lunch at a little cafe a couple of blocks from the gasmask factory the chickenactually almost chickenlessstew was pretty bad even by wartime standards but the house wine that went with it was noticeably better thanordinaire after a couple of glasses you stopped noticing the stringy carrots and sad potatoes that accompanied the little dicedup bits of chickenor rabbit or maybe cat lunch finished jager and skorzeny walked back the way they had come the lizards took no notice of them skorzeny started whistling something after the first few bars jager gave him a shot in the ribs with an elbow a good thing too it was the horst wessel song when they got back to the flat skorzeny hopped up and down like a kid with a new toy i want to do it now he said over and over better we wait till tonight jager kept answering less chance of someone noticing us setting up a mortar in the middle of the parc rochegude but theyre more likely to notice us carrying the stuff at night skorzeny argued you carry boxes during the day youre a workman you carry boxes at night if youre lucky people think youre a burglar on your way to do a job you arent so lucky they think youve already done it and they try to rob you no jager said yet again the park is just a little ways awaythats why we took this flat remember we can carry all our gear in one trip set up in the middle of that nice stand of elms we found and start firing we can get off eight or ten bombs in a minute or so and then get the hell out of there what could be better than that watching the fur fly skorzeny answered without hesitation then he sighed i dont suppose we could do that anyway wouldnt be a good idea to walk past the factory on our way out of town why jager said in mock astonishment just because well have lobbed eight or ten bombs full of tabun into it and around the neighborhood all wed have to do is hold our breath as we went by youre rightmaybe we could get away with it before jager could explode skorzeny laughed at him im joking son im joking tabun isnt anything to joke about jager cast a respectful eye on the mortar bombs he and skorzeny had carried down through the lizard lines from germany had one of those bombs developed the tiniest leak the sun would have gone dark in the sky his lungs would have stopped working and he wouldnt have made it to albi well i dont say youre wrong about that skorzeny answered its some very nasty stuff for a fact thefuhrer wasnt going to use it even against the lizards till the british hauled out their mustard gas then i suppose he decided he might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb thefuhrer knows about gas jager said he was in the trenches in france himself he remembered his own days there the frantic cries of alarm when the gas shells started landing the struggle to get your mask on and tight before the tendrils of poison reached you and started eating your lungs the anguished cries of comrades who hadnt grabbed their masks fast enough the stifling feel of every breath the way you started wanting to tear off the mask after youd worn it for hours on end no matter what happened to you once you did across a quarter of a century those memories remained vivid enough to make the fear sweat prickle up under his arms grumpily otto skorzeny said all right jager well do it your way tonight when its nice and dark should be clear too which wont be bad if we can spy the north star through the trees give us a better gauge of true north than our compasses would if somebodys tampered with our marks thats true jager said theyd picked the spot from which they would fire a good while before thanks to some excellent maps of albi and their french friends no not friends partners the frenchmen had been enemies of vichy when petain collaborated with the germans and remained enemies now that he was collaborating with the lizards they knew the range and bearing from their chosen copse in the parc rochegude to the gasmask factory to within a few meters and minutes of the arc it was just a matter of getting the mortar pointing in the right direction fiddling with the elevation screw and firing away to kill time till darkness fell they played skat as he usually did skorzeny won money from jager they were playing for vichy francs though so the losses hardly felt real jager thought of himself as a pretty fair cardplayer and wondered if skorzeny cheated hed never caught him at it and if he did skorzeny would make jokes about it and turn it into a lark what could you do when twilight came and the sky turned purplegray skorzeny stuck the cards in his pocket and said shall i make us some supper i thought you wanted us to live till tonight jager said which earned him a glare from the bigger man as anyone does who spends time in the field skorzeny had learned to cook after a fashion roasted meats stews made from whatever was handy thrown into a pot and stuck over the fire for a while since jager cooked the same way he waved a hand to tell skorzeny to go ahead you couldnt do a lot to mess up beans and cabbage and onions and carrots and potatoes the stew was bland and boring but it filled the belly at the moment jager didnt care about anything else the flat had good blackout curtains that let him turn on the electric lights after supper and let skorzeny win more funny money from him with those possibly trained pasteboards seven eight nine ten eleven the hours crawled slowly past when midnight struck skorzeny loaded the thirty kilos of mortar onto his back slung into a big cloth bag jager carried the bombs in the packs he and the ss man had used to bring them down from germanheld territory they closed the door behind them and went downstairs and then outside as quietly as they could every little clank they made seemed magnified in the dark silent street jager wondered how many people were peering at them as they trudged east down the avenue du marechal foch toward the park he also wondered if he would make it to the park added together the mortar bombs and powder charges were at least as heavy as the weapon that fired them while he was not nearly so big and burly as otto skorzeny he was staggering but still moving along when they got to the parc rochegude a rustle in the bushes made him snatch for the pistol he wore in the waistband of his trousers just a couple playing games skorzeny said with a coarse laugh might have been a couple of men but its too dark for me to be sure the treesurrounded open space theyd picked to set up the mortar had no couples using it for which jager was heartily glad he had found a discarded french letter in it one morning we wont need the compass or the north star he said with relief a few days before skorzeny had splashed whitewash on a branch of one of the elms in the grove set the base plate of the mortar on the gray stone jager had placed in the grass aim the barrel over the white splash and the lizardsand the humans who worked for themwould learn collaboration had its price skorzeny assembled the mortar swearing softly when he barked his knuckles in the darkness hed practiced so often in the flat that the lethal little device quickly grew from a collection of innocentlooking hardware to an artillery piece he lined it up roughly on the marked branch then turned the traversing screw to bring it to exactly the bearing he wanted at last he grunted in satisfaction and began adjusting the elevation screw so the mortar would fling its bombs just the right distance jager meanwhile had been taking the bombs out of the packs and standing them on their tailfins by the mortar even without knowing the particularly lethal freight they carried anyone would have recognized them as intended for no good purpose nothing painted flat black and full of sharp curves and angles was apt to be a kiddie toy flick on your lighter skorzeny said i want to make sure i have the elevation right wouldnt do to shoot over or under no it wouldnt jager dug the lighter out of his pocket and flicked the wheel with his thumb his breath came short and quick as if hed spied a lizard panzers turret traversing to bring its main armament to bear on him a cry ofquestce que cest and feet pounding toward the copse would be just as disastrous now after what seemed like an eternity but couldnt have been more than half a minute skorzeny said everythings fine douse it jager flicked the cover over the flame even that little noise made his heart pound well the parc rochegude would know bigger noises any minute now skorzeny softly slapped him on the back he took that as his signal to begin snatching up a bomb he dropped it down the barrel of the mortar whamthe noise hit harder than that of a panzers cannon he didnt have several centimeters of steel shielding him from most of it now he grabbed another bomb sent it after the first onewham between shots he tried to use his stunned ears to listen for any outcry and for whistle blasts from the french gendarmerie he didnt hear anything and prayed that meant there wasnt anything to hear hed brought a dozen bombs in all hed hoped to be able to fire most of them before the uproar started in just over a minute he sent every one of them on its way skorzeny slapped him on the back again this time hard enough to stagger him you can be on my mortar team any day the burly ss man bawled his mouth as close to jagers ear as if hed been a lover thats wonderful jager said dryly now lets get back to the flat before somebody spots us out here and puts two and two together just a minute skorzeny grabbed the mortar by the tripod heaved it up off the ground jager started in alarm the plan had called for leaving it behind but skorzeny didnt carry it far close by the copse was a little pond he heaved the mortar in with a splash they wont find it till sunup this way and maybe not for a while afterwards by thengott mit uns well be on our way gott mit unsjager echoed now come on damn it theyd just shut the front door to their building when several men came round the corner and dashed toward the park jager and skorzeny hurried upstairs the biggest worry in the plan had been that people would come out of their block of flats when the mortar started banging that would make them notice the two men in number had been outsideand wonder why they probably wouldnt have wondered long but the hallway was empty when jager closed the door behind him he let out a long sigh of relief off in the distance sirens wailed and bells clanged ambulances and fire engines solemnly he stuck out his hand as solemnly skorzeny shook it the ss man pulled the cork from a bottle of wine took a swig and passed it to jager jager wiped it on his sleeve and then drank too success he said skorzenys big head bobbed up and down after a moment jager thought about what his toast had meant some unknown number of frenchmenfrenchwomen too very likelyasphyxiating not because theyd harmed him in particular but because to support themselves and their families they were turning out goods the lizards could use the wine turned to vinegar in his mouth this is a filthy business were in he said you just figured that out skorzeny said come on jager youre not a virgin except maybe in your left ear if we dont hurt the lizards we lose if hurting the lizards means hurting civilians too well too bad these things happen we did what we were supposed to do what our superiors ordered us to do jajager said in a hollow voice what skorzeny didnt get and wouldnt get if he lived to be a hundrednot likely considering how the ss man livedwas thatwhat we were supposed to do andwhat our superiors ordered us to do werent necessarily one and the same thing soldiers didnt commonly have to draw that distinction jager hadnt worried about it not until he found out how the germans dealt with jews in the east since then he hadnt been able to look away he knew what sort of disaster awaited the world if the lizards won the war like skorzeny he was willing to do just about anything to keep that from happening unlike the ss man he wasnt willing to believe everything he did was fine and virtuous that made for another subtle distinction but he clung to it panting jens larssen stopped at the top of berthoud pass his breath smoked in the thin cold air snow dappled the ground and turned the pines and firs into a picture right off a christmas card snow and ice also turned us into a slippery slalom course that had to be treated with the utmost respect downhill from here jens said that was literally true hed lose more than a mile of altitude before he made it back to denver a bit more than fifty miles away it also normally implied everything would be easy the rest of the way heading back to denver wasnt going to be easy if your bike hit an icy patch and skidded while you were slogging uphill to the continental divide youd fall and scrape your shin if you lost it while you were speeding down some of these steep grades youd break a legor your neck slow and easy he said out loud reminding himself slow and easy hed spent some of his time getting up to the pass walking the bicycle hed spend even more coming down all the same with luck hed be in denver in a couple of days and then before long the metallurgical laboratory could pack up and head for hanford and the columbia up in tabernash a ways to the north hed bought a knitted wool sailors cap god only knew what it was doing there tabernash was about as far from the sea as you could get in north america he kept it pulled down over his ears even though that made them itch he also hadnt bothered shaving since the leaves started turning colors his beard had come in thick and strawberry blond it did a surprisingly good job of keeping his cheeks and chin warm i wonder if mary cooley would know me he muttered idaho springs lay only twenty miles or so to the east his hand went over his shoulder and briefly caressed the barrel of the springfield he wore slung on his back but now that he found himself close to idaho springs he also found he wasnt killing angry at the waitress whod given him the clap not any more the sulfa tablets dr henry had given him in hanford had done the job the disease wasnt bothering him at all now he didnt even have the morning drop of pus he had to piss away with the days first whizz so he supposed he was curedill let the bitch live he thought and felt magnanimous the sky was the grayishyellow color that warned of more snow coming he made the best speed he could down us the lower he was when it started to fall the happier hed be one thing growing up in minnesota did it taught you what to do in a blizzard and if he hadnt learned then traveling crosscountry the winter before would have imparted a lesson or three he rolled past an abandoned studebaker dead cars and trucks lined the highway here one there a clump here another theyd make decent shelters if it really started coming down hard somewhere up off the road a cougar yowled the wildlife was probably having a high old time these days not a lot of people were able to get up here and go hunting as they had once thinking of the lizards being good for something on earth felt odd jens hands tightened on the black rubber grips of the handlebars the lizards hadnt been good for him not even slightly if theyd just stayed on the pages of the pulp magazines where they belonged he and barbara would still be married and happy he meant to say a thing or two to her when he got back to denverand to sam yeager too hed been thinking about that on and off ever since he headed west he reached back and patted the gun barrel again that might end up doing some of his talking for him he didnt quite make it into idaho springs before darkness descended like a cloak a few minutes later the snow started falling larssen kept rolling along until he came to a dead car in the middle of the road a cadillac no less he said as he came up to it it would be roomier than a lot of the autos in which hed taken refuge during his travels the cadillacs windows were rolled up and the doors locked as if the fellow whod been driving it had been sure hed be back to get it pretty soon jens took savage pleasure in smashing the driversside window with the butt of his rifle he unlocked the door opened it with a squeak of rusty hinges and reached inside to unlock the back door then he shut the front door again he wondered if he should have shot out the frontdoor lock instead to keep cold air from blowing in and thought about going on and finding another car hell with it he said the window still had some glass in it and he would have rolled it down a couple of inches for the fresh air anyhow even if the cadillac was full of the musty smell of mildew he wouldnt find any better place to spread out his sleeping bag the backseat was plenty long and plenty wide it would have made a wonderful backseat for making out though he doubted whether people who owned cadillacs needed to use backseats for such purposes he unrolled the sleeping bag and also took a couple of thick wool blankets from the pack hed tied to the bicycles carrying rack he still had bread and homemade butter hed got in tabernash he ate some of that hed eaten like a pig all through this jaunt and was skinnier now than he had been at the start of it with the sleeping bag around him and the blankets on top he was plenty warm enough he slid the rifle down into the space between the backseat and the front the transmission hump made it stick up a little anybody who tries messing with me for any reason at all will regret it he said he woke up unmessed with the next morning to some of the most supernal quiet hed ever known it was as if the snow of the night before had coated the whole world with a thick blanket of muffling feathers the shift of the car springs under him as he sat up was the only sound in the land keeping on the road would be more interesting than it had been no snow plows not now nor salt that let tires grip even as it rotted fenders slow and easy he told himself again as it had when he came through westbound idaho springs had sentries out to check on who entered their little town when jens started to produce his letter signed by general groves the men stood aside you go right on ahead buddy one of them said i member you and that there letter from back a few months dont i larssen pedaled through idaho springs and then struggled up to the top of floyd hill which wasnt that much lower than berthoud pass after that the road got better even if it wasnt plowed what looked from the marks like a wagon train had been through ahead of him defining the roadway and shoving aside the worst of the snow he made good time coming down into denver before the lizards came the town had held better than a quarter of a million people what with evacuations simple flight and bombings not nearly so many lived there nowadays all the same the sight of so many men and women on the streets felt strange and untoward and made larssen nervous hed got very used to his own company and nobody elses on his travels he wondered how hed fit in the met lab team once he got back to the university of denver hell with em he muttered if they cant make room for me thats their problem a man riding east alongside him on us no they called it colfax avenue here in townoverheard that and gave him a curious look he stared back so fiercely that the nosy parker found some business elsewhere in a hurry jens swung south onto university boulevard just as the sun which had come out in the afternoon sank behind the rockies that didnt bother him he knew just where he was going now and he didnt figure the met lab crew were working eighthour days and then knocking off the buildings on the university campus were dark but that didnt mean anything except on the east coast blackouts had been kind of a joke in the united states after the first few panicky days that followed pearl harbor but the coming of the lizards turned them into deadly serious business once more a lot of work got done behind blackout curtains he stopped the bike outside the science building then opened the door and went in pushing his way through the curtains that shielded the electric lights from view the shining bulbs made his eyes water not just for their brilliance but also as a sign the twentieth century still lived a sentry stood a few paces inside the doorway by the time jens got through the yards of black cloth pinned to the ceiling the fellow had a rifle aimed at his brisket who goes there he demanded and then after a moment with visible reluctance moved the rifle aside oh its you dr larssen welcome back his tone gave the lie to the words hello oscar jens tried to keep what he was feeling out of his voice oscar had been his bodyguardhis keeper if you wanted a less polite word for itwhen he got into denver oscar had also slugged him when he had tried to talk sense into barbara all right hed grabbed her but still the bitch hadnt had any business squawking like that he fought down the red rage that made him want to throw himself at the soldier is general groves still working yes sir he is oscar sounded relieved to be sticking to business he works late most every night you want to see him now sir yeah i do larssen answered ive been on the road a long time the sooner he hears what i have to say the sooner he can start doing something about it okay dr larssen you can go on upstairs oscar hesitated uh sir you want to leave that springfield down here with me it was phrased as a request but it didnt sound like one jens unslung the rifle and leaned it against the wall not without an inward pang he did his best to sound light as he said dont suppose ill need to shoot anybody before i come back down the one he really wanted to shoot was oscar by the way the soldiers eyes clung to him as he walked over to the stairwell oscar knew it too the door to leslie groves office was ajar jens rapped on the frosted glass panel set into the top part of it whos there groves demanded gruffly taking that as all the invitation he was likely to get jens went in surprise spread over groves heavy features he got up from behind his desk stuck out a big thick hand dr larssen we were beginning to be afraid you wouldnt make it back come in sit down mechanically jens shook hands thanks he said and sank into one of the wooden chairs in front of the desk with a sigh he shrugged off his pack you look like something the cat dragged in groves said surveying him he picked up the phone dialed four numbers that you fred listen send me up some fried chicken maybe half a dozen of those nice rolls and some honey to go with em ive got a prodigal to feed here so dont waste time he slammed the receiver down on its cradle even in ordering up some supper he was a man who brooked no nonsense jens fell on the food like a starving wolf even if all the choices had been groves rather than his own when hed reduced it to gnawed bones and crumbs groves pulled a bottle of bourbon out of his desk drawer took a snort and passed it to him he had a hefty swig himself then gave it back okay now that youre not going to fall to pieces right before my eyes tell me about your trip groves said tell me about this town in washington you were supposed to be scouting did you actually manage to get there yes sir i sure did larssen looked at him with irritation the whiskey only fueled he did his best to sound enthusiastic as he went on hanfords the perfect place to move the met lab sir the columbias got all the water in the world in it there arent any lizards for hundreds of miles and theres a railhead into town what more do we need he waited for groves to leap in the air shoutwhoopee and start moving people around with the same verve and aggressiveness hed used in getting the fried chicken brought up but instead the met labs chief administrator said i appreciate all you did and i sure as the devil congratulate you for getting there and coming back again but things have changed since you left changed how jens demanded suspiciously what have you done started turning out dental floss instead of atomic bombs he wanted to make groves mad but the engineer just laughed not quite he said and explained the more jens heard the less he liked it wasnt so much everything the met lab crew had accomplished while he was gonegood god groves was talking glibly about kilogram quantities of plutonium what really grated was that the team had done all these important things had come to the very edge of being able to fabricate a bombwithout jens larssen he wished oscar hadnt made him leave his rifle downstairs he wanted to do some shooting now starting with groves and maybe ending with himself if the met lab was going to stay here in denver everything hed done since he rolled out of town was wasted effortspinning his wheels in the most literal sense of the word and they hadnt missed him one single solitary bit while he was gone either but general he said hearing the desperation in his own voice you dont understand what a swell place hanford really is how perfect it would be for us to work there he hadnt thought it was perfect when he rode into town hed thought it was a wide spot in the road nothing better but in retrospect it was starting to take on aspects of the earthly paradise he didnt want to think hed spent so much time in vain gently groves said im sorry dr larssen i truly am but while you were away weve put down deep roots here wed need months to make the move and get set up and producing again and we dont have months to spare we dont have days to spare hell larssen i grudge every inessential minute were making the best of things here and the best has turned out to be pretty good but jens stared at the jumble of chicken bones on his plate hed have just as easy a time putting the meat back on them as he would of persuading groves he offered a new gambit ill take this up with fermi and szilard go right ahead groves said accepting the move without a qualm if you can convince them ill listen to you but you wont convince them and ill bet money on that theyve got our second pile up and running under the stadium here and the third wont be far behind and our reprocessing plant is doing just fine separating plutonium from the uranium slugs where its made wed have to uproot that too if we headed for washington state jens bit his lip if things were as groves said the physicists wouldnt want to move logically rationally he didnt suppose he could blame them theyd lost months once already coming from chicago to denver they wouldnt want to lose more time not when they were so close to the success the united states needed so badly sometimes though you couldnt go by logic and reason and nothing else clutching at straws larssen said what if the lizards start a big overland push toward denver theres nothing much to stand in their wayyou couldnt ask for better tank country than eastern colorado i wont say youre wrong about that but it hasnt happened yet and i dont think it will happen soon groves answered its long since started snowingyoud know more about that than i do wouldnt you last year the lizards didnt do much once the snow started falling they seem to be pretty predictable so its a good bet they wont get aggressive till spring and by spring well give them enough other things to worry about that they wont even be thinking of denver youve got it all figured out dont you jens said bitterly oh lord how i wish i did groves rolled his eyes in case i havent said so though im damned glad to have you back youll be able to ease the strain on a lot of people whove been stretched real thin for a long time jens heard that asyoull be a spare tire well put you on whenever we need to patch a blowout and then well heave you back in the trunk again he almost told groves just what he thought of him just what he thought of the whole met lab crew project and all but groves held the whip hand here telling him off wouldnt do anything but ruin the chance for revenge voice tightly controlled jens asked hows barbara doing these days do you think theres any chance shed want to see me i really couldnt tell you about that one way or the other dr larssen groves sounded wary which wasnt like him the thing is she andand her husband left the met lab staff not long after you headed west yeager got a new assignment and it was one where she could be useful too so she went along isee jens said the first time hed gone away barbara hadnt waited for him to come home shed slid out of her skirt for that damn dumb ballplayer now when he went off to do something else for his country she hadnt wanted so much as to set eyes on him when he got back wasnt the world a hell of a place he asked where did shewhere did theygo afraid i cant tell you that groves answered i couldnt tell you even if you didnt know either one of them we do try to keep up security no matter how irregular things get sometimes and what with the troubles youve had itd be better for you and for them if you didnt know where they were yeah maybe jens didnt believe it for a minute it might be better for the whore who had been his wife and the bastard she was shacked up with but for him he shook his head getting his own back would be better for him changing the subject again he asked where are you going to put me up for the night lets see if i remember right you were boq over at lowry werent you groves did have an impressive ability to remember detail why dont we send you back there for the time being anyhow things are pretty cramped right around the campus here okay jens saidspare tire sure as hell you have to remember though that i am going to keep trying to convince you and everybody else that hanford is a better place than denver for making bombs oh i believe you groves said what i dont believe is that its enough better to justify shutting down here and making tracks to start up again over there you get yourself a good nights sleep look around and see what weve done while you were away and see if you dont change your mind yourself ill do that larssen said but he was damned if anything would change his mind not now not after all hed been through he got up and started for the door wait groves said he scrawled rapidly on a sheet of paper show this to the sentries at lowry field show it to colonel hexham too if he doesnt want to give you a room at the inn right larssen took the paper left groves office and went downstairs he reclaimed his rifle from oscar and walked out into the night good old colonel hexham he muttered as he climbed onto his bicycle if hexham had just let him send a letter to barbara before it was too late hed probably still be married to her today a fling with that son of a bitch yeager wouldnt have mattered so much after all she had thought jens was dead but when she got herself knocked up that ruined everything and now groves wanted him to deal with hexham he rode slowly up university to alameda then turned right to go on to lowry field as he pedaled east toward the air base the temptation rose in him to keep on going past it to keep heading east till he got to somewhere not far from the coloradokansas border nobody was going to listen to him here no matter how right he was he could see that plain as the nose on his face but if he headed out and talked to the lizards theyd be very interested in finding out what was going on in denver hed had that thought before hed almost ridden east instead of west when they sent him out to look hanford over hed fought it down then hed still figured his first obligation was to mankind but what if the only thing every goddamn human being in the world wants is to give me a hard time he asked the silent chilly darkness he got no answer when he came to the lowry field turnoff he stopped his bicycle and stood unmoving for two or three minutes at last he rode on toward the airfield he didnt want to admit even to himself how close hed come to choosing the other path rain drummed down out of a leaden sky most of the leaves were off the trees in pskova park they lay brown and forlorn on the yellow dying grass below as george bagnall walked toward the pskovkrom he thought the barebranched beeches and birches looked sad and miserable like skeletons with their arms held high in surrender to approaching winter sheets of water ran over the concrete slabs of the pavement rain collected in bomb craters turning them to muddy little ponds if you stepped into one not watching where you were going you could sink deeper than your waistor deeper than your head two or three people had already drowned that way or so rumor said the sentries at thekrom stood inside the entrance both to keep dry and to keep the lizards from spotting them from the air pskovs ancient fortress had taken a couple of bombs in the early days of the lizard invasion but the aliens had pretty much left it alone since everyone in town hoped they would go right on doing that who comes the german sentry demanded while his soviet opposite number raised the barrel of his submachine gun bagnall swept back the hood on the rain cape he was wearing ah the englishman the german said first in his own language and then in russian the soviet sentry nodded and gestured with his weapon go ahead spasebobagnall said his german after months of intensive practice was pretty fluent his russian wasnt so he used it whenever he could he went upstairs to the office of the local german commandantgeneralleutnant kurt chill good day mr bagnall chill said in excellent english brigadiers german and vasiliev i fear have not yet arrived i thank you at least for being punctual bagnall shrugged if you let russian habits of punctuality get you down you would go mad theyll be here general he said and so they would in five minutes or half an hour or a couple of hours the concept of having mean anything more than a way of sayingsometime this morning was beyond the russian mental horizon the two partisan leaders showed up at twenty of ten if they knew why kurt chill was gently steaming they didnt show it so nikolai vasiliev said let us discuss our moves against the imperialists from another world we should be able to drive them back from pskov while winter conditions prevail his comrade aleksandr german translated russian into yiddish which was close enough to german for chilland bagnallto understand on his own aleksandr german added they are weak in winter weaker even than you germans were that first year chill was used to such sniping and gave as good as he got we were strong enough then to hold you out of pskov he said with a chilly smile and we have got better since my hope is that the lizards will not do the same i think they probably wont bagnall said in german aleksandr german translated for vasiliev they seem to do the same old things over and over their old ones are quite bad enough vasiliev said through aleksandr german they are not imaginative fighterswhich was a hell of a thing for a russian the product of the worlds most rigid military system to saybut with their weapons and machines they do not always need to be we are lucky to have withstood them so long for them this is a subsidiary front general chill said had they put full effort into it they might well have overrun us nikolai vasiliev puffed out his broad chest with his dark curly beard he looked like a proud bandit chieftainwhich in many ways he was the flickering lamplight only added to the impression but he was also a soviet citizen and proud of it for he said the marvelous bomb the great stalin touched off south of moscow taught the lizards better than to risk too much against us in any one place bagnall glanced over at lieutenant general chill thewehrmacht officer looked as if hed bitten into something sour the germans set great store on their scientific ingenuity to have to listen to someone he probably thought of as a slavicuntermensch going on about the achievements of soviet science had to be gallingand all the more so because the nazis hadnt matched that bomb aleksandr german said we cannot count on the lizards holding back forever we need to force them to retreat wherever we can to regain the soil of therodina the motherland general chill will our men fight side by side in this as they have the past year and moreexcept when they were shooting at one anotherbagnall glossed silently to himself despite that reservation he looked for chill to give hearty assent chill had better give his assent if any planned winter offensive was to get anywhere the russians had more soldiers in pskov than the nazis did but their men were armed with rifles and submachine guns and a few machine guns the germans were the ones who had the artillery the lorries the carefully husbanded panzers the even more carefully husbanded petrol i shall have to examine the overall strategic situation was what chill did say standing on the defensive until spring may prove a wiser more economical choice vasiliev and aleksandr german both shouted at himcoward was one of the kinder words they used bagnall found himself speechless up till now chill had always been an aggressive commander willing even eager to spend lives to gain territory of course a lot of the lives hed spent around pskov were russian not only were a lot of the lives chill had spent russian so was a lot of the materiel the german garrison at pskov had done plenty of hard fighting and the lizards in poland cut them off from thevaterland one of these days hed have to think about what the differences betweenrodina andvaterland implied but not now not now as innocently as he could bagnall asked how is your supply situation general chill given all we have done it is not bad chill answered bagnall had heard a great many more responsive replies the german officers face said more it reminded bagnall of the look a poker player wore when hed got himself into a big hand and had to own up to holding nothing more ferocious than a pair of nines from strident aleksandr germans voice went soft persuasive generalleutnantsupplies from the soviet union would probably be available the routes and the amounts are not always what they might be but they do exist surely your welltrained men would not have much trouble getting used to soviet weapons hardlywe captured enough of them on the way here chill said with as much aplomb as he could muster more than bagnall had guessed he had in him he was indeed a formidable man when he continued he cut straight to the heart of the problem if i take soviet supplies and grow to depend on them to keep my force in being then before long i have to take soviet orders too if you dont then before long you have no supplies and it no longer matters whose orders you take because you wont be able to carry them out in any case aleksandr german said nikolai vasilievs eyes lit up with a fierce light and when you have no supplies left no point to our truce any more either we will restore pskov to therodina then and we will remember what you have done here youre welcome to try at any time you choose chill answered calmly this i tell you i do not lie we have plenty to knock any number of partisans back into the woods or into graves in them by all means feel free to test what i say the german soldier glared fiercely back at vasiliev by the look inhis eye he would sooner have killed russians than lizards any day of the week enough both of you bagnall exclaimed the only ones who gain when we bicker are the lizards we would do well to remember that we can hate one another later after the main war is won kurt chill and aleksandr german both stared at him as if hed suddenly started spouting swahili after aleksandr german translated nikolai vasiliev gave bagnall that same dubious look but slowly one by one the three leaders nodded this is truth chill said wewould do well to remember it daaleksandr german said but he could not resist twisting the knife also truthherr generalleutnant is that sooner or later hoard them or use them your german munitions will be exhausted then you will use those of the soviet union or you will cease being soldiers lieutenant general chill looked as if hed found a wormworse found half a wormin his apple the prospect of becoming not just allies but dependents on the soviet union after being first overlords and then at least superior partners because of superior firepower had to be anything but appetizing for him it can work bagnall insisted not just to thewehrmacht officer but also to the partisan brigadiers and yet it wasnt their shaky truce that made him speak with such conviction it was the passionate affair that german mechanic whod come into pskov with ludmila gorbunova was having with the fair tatiana much to bagnalls relief and even more to jerome jones the pair still didnt like each other much but that didnt stop them from coming together every chance they gotthey should be a lesson for all of us bagnall thought this should be a lesson for all of us atvar said looking with one eye at the video of the damage to the gasmask factory in albi and with the other at kirel whatever we thought of our security procedures they have been starkly revealed as inadequate truth exalted fleetlord kirel said and yet the destruction was not so bad as it would have been had these mortar rounds contained explosives rather than poison gas now that the plant has been decontaminated it is ready to resume full operation ready physically yes atvar felt ready himself ready to bite something in lieu of an actual enemy poor kirel would have to do of course the decontamination cost us four irreplaceable males of the race of course the gas attack itself killed most of one entire shift of highly trained big uglies of course the big uglies who work the other two shifts are afraid to go back into the plant even if it is decontaminated for one thing because they dont believe it truly is and for another because they fear the deutsche will attack once moreand how can we blame them for that when we fear it ourselves other than these minor details the plant is as you said ready to start up again kirel crouched down as if he expected to be bitten exalted fleetlord it is merely a matter of bringing in other tosevites who have this skill either that or making it plain to the locals that if they do not do this work they will not eat bringing tosevites into one area from another is far more difficult than it would be on a properly civilized world atvar said for they are not simply tosevites essentially the same regardless of from which part of the planet they spring some are francais tosevites some are english tosevites some are italiano tosevites some are mexicano tosevites and so on they all have their own foods they all have their own languages they all have their own customs and they all think their ways are superior to everyone elses which touches off fights whenever groups from two regions come together weve tried the emperor knows weve tried it he cast down his eyes not so much in reverence as in worn resignation it does not work the other approach will then kirel said no matter what foods they eat all the big uglies must eat some foods if they fail to produce what we require of them they will also fail to be fed this has some merit but again not so much as i would wish atvar said the sabotage level in tosevite factories producing goods for us is already unacceptably high wherever we try to coerce the workers to produce more or produce under harsher conditions it goes higher this is intolerable when the product under discussion is as important as a gas mask truth kirel said again this time wearily the big uglies poison gas has already lowered the morale of fighting males to the point where they have shown reluctance to go into combat in areas bordering the deutsche and now the americans are also beginning to deploy it in large quantities if males cannot have confidence in their protection their fighting spirit will plummet further with unfortunate consequences for our efforts here unfortunate consequences indeed atvar said what if his males simply upped and quit fighting hed never imagined such a thing no commander in the history of the race and perhaps not in its prehistory either had ever had to imagine such a thing the races discipline had always proved reliablebut nothing had ever tested it as it was being tested now if the males waver exalted fleetlord kirel said perhaps we can bolster their spirits with the tosevite herb known as ginger atvar stared at him kirel crouched again lower than he had before it was intended as a joke exalted fleetlord nothing more it isnot funny atvar said it also wasnt the worst idea hed ever heard not in the present circumstances that frightened him more than anything the lizards airraid alarms went off in lodz they werent sirens as they would have been had human beings made them instead they reminded mordechai anielewicz of nothing so much as the sound of a cauldron full of sizzling fatexcept the cauldron had to be half the size of poland they were he gathered an enormously amplified version of the noise a lizard made when something frightened it all that ran through his mind in less time than he needed to snatch up a gas mask and stick it on his head then along with the rest of the jews in the offices above the fire station he dashed for the sealed room people got in one anothers way cursing and stumbling and falling down he made it to the sealed room just as a nazi rocket came down with a crash he tried to gauge how far away it had landed by the sound of the explosion but that was tricky these days the rockets that carried gas didnt make a bang nearly so big as that from the ones carrying explosivesbut they were much more to be feared even so shut the door four people bawled at once with a slam somebody obeyed packed into the middle of the sardinelike crush and turned the wrong way anyhow mordechai couldnt see who he looked up at the ceiling fresh plaster gleamed all around its periphery covering over the cracks between it and the walls similar plaster marred the paint on those walls where they joined one another and also covered the molding that had marked their separation from the floor even if a gascarrying rocket hit close by the sealed room wouldeveryone inside hopedlet the people it sheltered survive till the deadly stuff dissipated splashes said people nearest the doorway were soaking cloths in a bucket of water and stuffing them into the cracks between the door and the wall the german poison gas was insidious stuff if you left a chink in your armor the gas would find it the lizards alarm kept hissing before long the merely human airraid siren added its wail to the cacophony does that mean were not done or just that people are too addled to turn those noisy things off one of the secretaries asked her voice muffled by the mask she wore well find out anielewicz said along with three other men and a woman lately the nazis had found a new way to keep the lizards and humans in lodz from getting anything done lobbing rockets at the city every so often making people take shelter and stay there for fear of gas not everyone had a sealed room to which to go and not all sealed rooms were as cramped as this one but the ploy was good enough to tie lodz in knots i wish the lizards would shoot down the rockets the way they did when the nazis first started firing them at us a woman said the lizards are almost out of their own rockets mordechai answered these days they only use them when one of the germans happens to head straight for an installation of theirs that wasnt an everyday occurrence while the lizards could make rockets that went exactly where they wanted those of the nazis were wildly inaccurate anielewicz went on if a rocket lands in the middle of lodz thats just too bad for the people under it the race is doing what it can for us david nussboym declared several people nodded emphatically mordechai anielewicz rolled his eyes he suspected he wasnt the only one but with everybody in concealing gas masks he couldnt be sure the jewish administration and fighters in lodz were in a delicate position they had to cooperate with the lizards and somenussboym among themstill did so sincerely others though hurt the aliens every chance they got so long as they could do it without getting discovered keeping track of who was in which camp made life more interesting than anielewicz liked another blast this one close enough to shake the fire station even without a large charge of explosive several tons of metal falling out of the sky made for a big impact anielewicz shivered working against the lizards often meant covertly working with the nazis even when their poison gas was killing jews inside lodz some jews supported the lizards simply because they could not stomach working with the nazis no matter what anielewicz understood that he sympathized with it but not enough to feel the same way himself the nazis had been gassing polish jews before the lizards arrived and theyd kept right on doing it even after the lizards took poland away from them they were without a doubt bastards the only good thing mordechai could think to say about them was that they were human bastards minutes crawled slowly past mordechai kept hoping praying for the allclear signal instead another rocket landed the siren and the alarm hiss went on and on he drew in breath after breath of stagnant air his feet began to hurt the only place to sitor rather squatin the sealed room was over a latrine bucket in a tiny curtained corner just getting there wasnt easy at last the amplified hiss faded and the sirens changed to a warbling note before ceasing altogethergevalt somebody said lets get out of here is it safe somebody else asked just because the rockets arent coming does that mean the gas has gone away we cant stay here forever mordechai said ill go out and look around see if anyone close by is down from the gas if i dont come back in five minutes youll know i shouldnt have gone with such gallows humor he elbowed his way toward the door when he got outside he was relieved not to find people lying dead on lutomierska street in front of the fire station he hadnt expected he would find that none of the explosions had sounded close enough to produce such a result but the germans gas was insidious stuff and sometimes spread more in one direction than another the minute you stopped assuming it could kill you it probably would he looked around one column of smoke was rising from the north from the polish part of lodz the area where germans whod called the place litzmannstadt had settled before the lizards came not many of them were left the poles and the jews had had their revenge too bad in a way there would have been delicious irony in the nazis gassing the germans theyd sent out to dwell in a land that wasnt theirs more smoke though rose from closer to home one of the rockets had hit in the jewish district that must have been the second one mordechai thought the one that shook the station he snarled even now fighting the lizards the nazis were killing jews he was sure they knew it too they probably thought it was a hell of a good jokeand that some of the jews were cooperating with them against the lizards an even better one he went back inside before the people in the sealed room decided hed become a casualty too he hurried upstairs its safe to come out he said we had a hit in the ghetto though now that the germans were gone it wasnt formally a ghetto any more it still functioned as one though and the name lingered the fire engine will have to go tend to it david nussboym said i volunteer to ride along that took courage the germans gas could kill you not only if you breathed it but if it got on your skin anielewicz would have preferred to think of anyone who collaborated with the lizards as a spineless coward nussboym complicated his picture of the world he wanted to volunteer himself to show nussboym people who disagreed with him had spirit too but he made himself keep quiet with the collaborator away from the offices people who wanted to deal with the lizards instead of sucking up to them could speak freely come on said solomon gruver the big burly man who led the fire brigade and drove the engine his men and nussboym ran for the stairs i hope the people in the area are already hosing down the streets and the buildings anielewicz said between them and the engines they should be able to flush most of the gas down the mains he laughed a haunted hollow sound inside his mask were so used to dealing with the unspeakable that weve got very good at developing procedures for it either that proves were clever and quick or that were utterly damned maybe both the fire engine roared away bell clanging do you think we can take our masks off a woman named bertha fleishman asked she was drab and mousy no one human or lizard took any special notice of her that made her one of the most valuable spies the jews in lodz had she could go anywhere hear anything and report back lets find out anielewicz pulled the mask off his head he took a couple of deep breaths then gasped and crumpled to the floor instead of crying out in alarm and dismay people swore at him and looked around for things to throw the first time hed played that joke theyd been properly horrified now they halfway looked for it though he didnt do it all the time the rest of the people in the sealed room took off their masks too whew someone said its just about as stuffy in here with them off as it is with them on what are we going to do bertha fleishman said if we get rid of the lizards we get the germans back for us in particular that would be worse even if having the germans win and the lizards lose would be better for people as a whole after weve suffered so much shouldnt we be able to live a little she sounded wistful plaintive why should this time be different from all other times anielewicz said the reply so close to the first of the four questions from the passover seder but expecting a different response brought a sigh from everyone in the room he went on the real question should be what do we do if the lizards get sick of the germans harassing them and decide to put everything they have into smashing thereich they tried that against the english a man said it didnt work and thank god it didnt mordechai said wondering if hed sent moishe russie into worse danger than that from which hed escaped but its not the same the lizards logistics in england were very bad they had to fly all their soldiers and all their supplies up from southern france so it was almost as if they were trying to invade by remote control it wouldnt be like that if they attacked the nazis theyre right next door to them here and in france both whatever they do they probably wont do it right away not with snow on the ground bertha fleishman said they hate the cold come next spring it may be something to worry about until then i think theyll hold back and try to ride out whatever the nazis throw at them thinking about the way the lizards did things anielewicz slowly nodded you may be right he said but that only gives us more time to answer the question it doesnt make it go away teerts did not like flying over deutschland he hadnt liked flying over britain either and for much that same reason more and more tosevite jets in the air along with antiaircraft fire that seemed thick enough to let him get out of his killercraft and walk from one shell burst to the next his mouth dropped open in ironic laughter fire from the big uglies antiaircraft guns had done no more than put a couple of holes in the skin of his killercraft as best he could figure the one time hed been shot down was when hed had the colossal bad luck to suck infantrymales bullets into both engine turbines in the space of a couple of moments and his luck had only got worse once he descended inside the nipponese lines he never ever wanted to be captured again id sooner die he said superior sir that was sserep one of his wingmales nothing teerts said embarrassed at letting his thoughts go out over an open microphone he checked his radar the deutsche had some killercraft in the air but none close enough to his flight to be worth attacking he also watched the tosevites aircraft to make sure they werent pilotless machines like the ones hed encountered over britain orders on conserving antiaircraft missiles got more emphatic with every passing day before long he expected the fleetlord to issue one that said something likeif you have already been shot down and killed it is permissible to expend one missile against the enemy aircraft responsible expenditure of two will result in severe punishment he spotted a dark gray plume of smoke rising up from the ground and hissed with glee that was a railroad engine burning one of the incredibly noxious fuels the tosevites machines employed whatever a railroad engine was haulingbig uglies weapons suppliesit was a prime target he spoke to sserep and nivvek his other wingmale to make sure they saw it too then said lets go shoot it up he dropped down to low altitude and reduced his airspeed to make sure he could do a proper job of raking the target his fingerclaw stabbed at the firing button of the cannon flames stabbed out from the nose of his killercraft the recoil of the cannon and the turbulence from the fired shells made it shudder slightly in the air he yelled with savage glee as puffs of smoke spurted from the railroad cars as he shot over the locomotive that pulled the train he yanked the stick back hard to gain some altitude and come around for another pass acceleration tugged at him the world went gray for a moment he swung the killercraft through a ninetydegree roll so he could look back at the train he yelled again either sserep or nivvek had hit the engine hard and it was slowing to a stop now he and the other two males could finish destroying it at their leisure off in the middle distance on his radar set somethinghalf a dozen somethingsrose almost vertically into the air what are those nivvek exclaimed nothing to worry about i dont think teerts answered if the deutsche are experimenting with antiaircraft missiles of their own they have some more experimenting to do id say truth superior sir nivvek said amusement in his voice none of our aircraft is even in the neighborhood of thosewhatevertheyares so i see teerts said if they were missiles they were pretty feeble like other tosevite flying machines they seemed unable to exceed the speed of sound in the local atmosphere they climbed toward the peak of their arc in what looked to be a ballistic trajectory whereupon teerts forgot about them and gave his attention over to smashing up the train it had been carrying infantrymales perhaps among other things the first pass hadnt got all of them either some had bailed out of the damaged coaches the graygreen clothes they wore were hard to see against the ground but muzzle flashes told teerts some of them were shooting at him memories of the nipponese made fear blow through him in a choking cloudwhat if the big uglies got lucky twice with him they didnt his killercraft performed flawlessly as he flailed them with cannon fire shells smashed at them they boiled like the waves of tosev s oversized oceans he hoped hed slaughtered hundreds of them they werent nipponese but they were big uglies and in arms against the race no qualms about killing civilians diluted his revenge not here not now he pulled back on his stick again the train was afire at several places up and down its length one more run would finish the job of destroying it now that the nose of his killercraft was pointing upward again he checked the radar screen to make sure no deutsch aircraft were approaching sserep must have done the same thing at the same time for he shouted superior sir i see them teerts answered grimly the deutsch machines hed dismissed as experimentaland ineptantiaircraft missiles were diving on his flight of killercraft and plainly under intelligent control for the tosevites that meant they had to be piloted the big uglies didnt have automatic systems good enough for the job with a small shock he saw that the tosevite aircraft were flying faster than his own machine at least momentarily that let them choose terms of engagement something rare in their airtoair engagements with the race he gave his killercraft maximum power acceleration shoved him back against the seat the big uglies wouldnt keep the advantage long i am firing missiles superior sir sserep said after we get back to base ill argue about it with the males in supply who seem to spend all their time counting pieces of eggshell the point is to be able to get backto base teerts didnt argue the missiles streaked past his killercraft tailing thin plumes of smoke the tosevites aircraft had smoky exhaust too far more smoky than that of the missiles with hideous speed they swelled from specks to sweptwing killercraft of peculiar designjust before he stabbed his firing button with a fingerclaw he had a fractional instant to wonder how they maintained stability without tailfins whatever the details of the aerodynamics maintain stability they did one of them managed to sideslip a missile electronics would have been hardpressed to do that for mere flesh and blood to accomplish it was little short of a miracle ssereps other missile exploded its target in a spectacular midair fireball that made teerts nictitating membranes flick out to protect his eyes from the flash what in the name of the emperor were the big uglies using for fuel that thought too quickly faded he blazed away at the strange machine heading straight for his killercraft winking flashes of light at its wing roots said it was shooting at him too deutsch killercraft carried cannon they could do real damage if they scored hits without warning the big ugly aircraft blew up as violently as the one ssereps missile had hit yes teerts shouted the only feeling that matched midair triumph was a good taste of ginger superior sir i regret to report that my aircraft is damaged nivvek said i waited too long before firing missiles and they shot past the tosevites they were still too close to me to arm their warheads i am losing speed and altitude and fear i shall have to eject wish me luck spirits of emperors past go with you nivvek teerts said gnashing his teeth in anguish urgently he added try to stay away from the big uglies on the ground as long as you can keep clear of them your radio beacon gives you some chance of being rescued how good a chance here in the middle of deutschland he tried not to think about his own memories of captivity were too sharp and dreadful nivvek did not answer sserep said he has ejected superior sir i saw the capsule blast free of his killercraft and the parachute deploy he paused then went on i dont have the fuel to loiter till rescue aircraft come after a quick glance at his own gauges teerts said neither have i hating every word he checked his radar only one of the deutsch killercraft was still in the air streaking away at low altitude sserep and nivvek hadnt been idlenor had he he turned and expended one of his missiles it streaked after the strange little tailless aircraft and blew it out of the sky thats the last of those sserep said the emperor grant that we dont see their like again soon truth teerts said feelingly the big uglies keep coming up with new things he said that as if hed been accusing them of devouring their own hatchlings against what theyd had when the race landed on tosev combat had been a walkover only males who were unluckyas teerts had beengot shot down now at least above the western end of the main continental mass you had to earn your living every moment in the air we wont even be able to cannibalize spares from nivveks aircraft sserep said his voice sad somewhere down there in a deutsch factory big ugly technicians were welding and riveting the airframes for more of their nasty little killercraft somewhere down there big ugly pilots were learning to fly them the race made do with what it had brought along day by day less and less of that remained what would happen when it was all gone one more thing to think about teerts used satellite relay to call both his base in southern france and the nearest air base the race held east of deutschland in the territory called poland nivveks rescue alarm should have been received at both of them but teerts was taking no chances he got the feeling the base in poland had more things to worry about than nivvek the male to whom he spoke spent half his time babbling about a deutsch rocket attack teerts wondered why antimissile missiles didnt protect the base the most obviousand the most depressinganswer was that no missiles were left if that was so how soon would he be flying without any antiaircraft missiles what would happen when his radar broke down and no spare parts were left well be even with the big uglies he said and shuddered at the thought of it liu han stared at the row of characters on a sheet of paper in front of her her face was a mask of concentration the tip of her tongue slipped out between her lips without her noticing she gripped a pencil as if it were a dagger then remembered she wasnt supposed to hold it that way and shifted it back between her index and middle fingers slowly painstakingly she copied the characters written on the sheet of paper she knew what they said scaly devils give back the baby you stole from liu han at your camp near shanghai she wanted to make sure the little devils could read what she wrote when shed finished the sentence she took a pair of shears and clipped off the strip of paper on which shed written then she picked up the pencil and wrote the sentence again she had a great bundle of strips all saying the same thing she was also getting a new callus just behind the nail on her right middle finger a lifetime of farming cooking and sewing had left her skin still soft and smooth there now that she was doing something less physically demanding than any of those it marked her she shook her head nothing was as simple as it first seemed she started writing the sentence yet again now she knew the sound and meaning of each character in it she could write her own name which brought her its own kind of excitement and when she was out on the streets andhutungs of peking she sometimes recognized characters shed written over and over and could occasionally even use them to figure out the meanings of other characters close by them little by little she was learning to read someone knocked on the door to the cramped little chamber she used at the rooming house she picked up her one set of spare clothes and used them to hide what she was doing before she went to open the door the rooming house was a hotbed of revolutionary sentiment but not everyone was to be trusted even people who did support the revolution might not need to know what she was doing living in a village and especially in a camp had taught her the importance of keeping secrets but waiting outside in the hall stood nieh hoting she didnt know whether he knew the secrets of everyone in the rooming house but he did know all of hersall at least that had anything to do with the struggle against the little scaly devils she stood aside come in superior sir she said the last two words in the scaly devils language no harm in reminding him of the many ways she could be useful to the peoples cause nieh knew next to nothing of the little devils tongue but he did recognize that phrase it made him smile thank you he said walking past her into the little room his own was no finer anyone who could believe he had become a revolutionary for personal gain was a fool he nodded approvingly when he noticed trousers and tunic covering up her writing you do well to keep that hidden from prying eyes i do not want to let people know what i am doing she answered as she shut the door behind him she laughed a little before going on i think i would leave it open if you were hsia shoutao oh why is that nieh hoting asked a little more sharply than her comment deserved you know why perfectly well or you should liu han said irritated at his obtusenessmen she thought all he wants to do is see my bodya euphemism for doing other things with it than merely seeing it nieh said that is not all hsia shoutao wants he is a committed peoples revolutionary and has risked much to free the workers and peasants from the oppression first of the upper classes and then of the scaly devils he coughed he is also fond of women perhaps too fond i have spoken to him about this have you liu han said pleased that was more action than shed expected men usually look the other way when their comrades take advantage of women eryes nieh paced around the chamber which did not have a lot of room for pacing liu han took her spare clothes off the table nieh not only knew what she was doing he had started her on the project he came over and examined what shed done you form your characters more fluidly than you did when you began he said you may not have the smooth strokes of a calligrapher but anyone who read this would think you had been writing for years i have worked hard liu han said a truth that applied to her entire life your labor is rewarded he told her she didnt think he had come to her room for no other reason than to compliment her on her handwriting usually though when he had something to say he came out and said it he would have called anything else bourgeois shillyshallying most of the time what then was he keeping to himself liu han started to laugh the sound made nieh jump she laughed harder what do you find funny he asked his voice brittle you she said for a moment seeing only the man and not the officer of the peoples liberation army when i complained about hsia shoutao that left you in a complicated place didnt it what are you talking about he demanded but he knew he knew she could tell by the way he paced again harder than ever and by the way he would not look at her she almost did not answer him not directly a proper chinese woman was quiet submissive and if she ever thought about desire between woman and man did not openly say so but liu han had been through too much to care about proprietyand in any case the communists talked a great deal about equality of all sorts including that between the sexeslets see if they mean what they say she thought im talking about youand about me she answered or didnt you come up here now to see if you could get down on the mattress with me nieh hoting stared at her she laughed again for all he preached for all the communists preached down deep he was still a man and a chinese shed expected nothing different and so was not disappointed but unlike most chinese men he did have some idea that his prejudices were just prejudices not laws of nature the struggle on his face was a visible working out ofwhat did he call it the dialectic thats what the word was the thesis was his old traditional not truly questioned belief the antithesis his communist ideology and the synthesisshe watched to see what the synthesis would be what if i did he said at last sounding much less stern than he had moments before what if he did now she had to think about that she hadnt lain with anyone since bobby fioreand nieh in a way had been responsible for bobby fiores death but it wasnt as if hed murdered him only that hed put him in harms way as an officer had a right to do with a soldier he commanded on the scales that balanced what about the rest if she let him bed her she might gain influence over him that way but if they quarreled afterwards she would lose not only that influence but also what shed gained through her own good sense shed won solid respect for that the project for which she was writing her endless slips had been her own idea after all there too the scales balanced which left her one very basic question did she want him he was not a badlooking man he had strength and selfconfidence aplenty what did that add up tonot enough she decided with more than a twinge of regret if i let a man take me to the mattress now she said it will be because i want him not because he wants me that is not enough never again will that be enough for me to lie with anyone she shuddered remembering the time with yi min the village apothecary after the little scaly devils captured them bothand even worse times with men whose names she never knew up in the little devils airplane that never came down bobby fiore had won her heart there simply by being something less than brutal she never wanted to sink so low again she hadnt directly refused nieh not quite she waited more than a little anxious to see if hed understood what shed told him he smiled crookedly i will not trouble you any more about this then he said having a man interested in me is not a trouble liu han said she recalled how worried shed been when her husbandbefore the japanese came before the scaly devils came and turned the world upside downhad wanted nothing to do with her while she was carrying their child that had been a bleak and lonely time even sowhen a man does not listen when you say you do not want him that is trouble what you say makes good sense nieh answered we can still further the revolution together even if not in congress she liked him very much then almost enough to change her mind shed never knowntruth to tell shed never imagineda man who could joke after shed turned him down yes we are still comrades she said earnestly i want thati need that she did not add not for him to hear aloud she went on now you know the difference between yourself and hsia shoutao i knew that difference a long time ago he said hsia too is still a revolutionary though do not think otherwise no one is perfect or even good in all ways that is so liu han clapped her hands i have an idea listen to me we should arrange to have our beastshow men give a couple of exhibitions for the little scaly devils where nothing goes wrongthey simply give their shows and leave that will tell us how well the little devils search their cages and equipment and will also make the scaly devils feel safer about letting beast shows into the buildings they use i have had pieces of this thought myself nieh hoting said slowly but you give reasons for doing it more clearly than i had thought of them i will discuss it with hsia you may talk with him about it too of course it may even interest him enough to keep his mind off wanting to see your body his smile said he was joking again but not altogether liu han nodded as hed said hsiawas a dedicated revolutionary and a good enough idea for hurting the scaly devils would draw his attention away from fleshly matters for a while liu han said if he likes the notion well enough it will only make him want me more because he will think someone who comes up with a good idea is desirable just on account of that she laughed after a moment so did nieh hoting he found an excuse to leave very soon after that liu han wondered if he was angry at her in spite of what hed said had he done what shed said hsia would do decided he wanted her not so much because of the woman she was as in admiration of her ideas for the struggle against the little scaly devils once the idea occurred to her it would not go away it fit in too well with what shed seen of how nieh hotings mind worked she went back to writing her demand on strip after strip of paper all the while she wondered whether she should consider niehs ideologically oriented advances a compliment or an insult even after she set aside pen and paper and scissors she couldnt make up her mind behind the glass partition the engineer pointed to moishe russie youre on russie looked down at his script and began to read good day ladies and gentlemen this is moishe russie speaking to you from london still the capital of the british empire and still free of lizards some of you have no idea how glad i am to be able to say that others have the misfortune of suffering under the lizards tyranny and know for themselves whereof i speak he glanced over at nathan jacobi who nodded encouragement for him to go on it was good to be working with jacobi again it felt like better days the days before the invasion moishe took a deep breath and continued the lizards sought to bring great britain under their direct control i can tell you now that they have failed and failed decisively no lizards in arms remain on british soil all are either fled captured or dead the last lizard airstrip on the island that at tangmere in the south has fallen he hadnt seen that with his own eyes when it became clear the lizards were abandoning their british toehold hed been recalled to london to resume broadcasting he checked his script to see where hed resume it was yiddish of course for broadcast to jews and others in eastern europe all the same it sounded very much like what a bbc newsreader would have used for an english version that pleased him he was getting a handle on the bbc style we have now proved decisively what others began to demonstrate last year the lizards are not invulnerable they can be defeated and driven back moreover just as their weapons have on occasion discomfited us we too have devised means of fighting for which they have as yet developed no countermeasures this bodes well for future campaigns against them how it boded for the soul of mankind was another question one he felt less confident about answering everyone was using gas against the lizards now and praising it to the skies because it killed them in carload lots but if they vanished off the face of the earth tomorrow how long till earthly nations remembered their old quarrels and started using gas on one another how long till the germans started using it on the jews they still ruled for that matter how did he know they werent using it on the jews they still ruled nothing came out of germany but what little hitler and gobbels wanted known even as he thought about what mankind would do after the lizards were vanquished he realized beating them came first and so he read on wherever you who hear my voice may be you too can join the fight against the alien invaders you need not even take up a gun you can also contribute to the war against them by sabotaging goods you produce if you work in a factory by not paying paying late or underpaying the exactions they seek to impose on you by obstructing them in any way possible and by informing their foes of what they are about to do with your help we can make earth so unpleasant for them that they will be glad to pack up and leave he finished the last line of the script just as the engineer drew a finger across his throat to show time was up in the soundproof control room the engineer clapped his hands then pointed to nathan jacobi who began reading the english version of russies talk jacobi was a consummate professional the engineer took for granted his finishing spot on what struck moishe about his colleagues reading was how much of it he understood when hed first begun broadcasting for the bbc hed had next to no english now he could follow it pretty well and speak enough to get by he felt less alien in london than he sometimes had in purely polish sections of warsaw there thats done it jacobi said when they were off the air he clapped moishe on the back jolly good to be working with you again for a while there i doubted we should ever have the chance so did i moishe said i have to remind myself that this is warfare too ive seen altogether too much of the real thing lately oh yes jacobi got up and stretched the real thing is a great deal worse to go through but you and i may be able to do more damage to the lizards here than we could on campaign i tell myself as much at any rate so do i moishe said as he too rose is eric blair broadcasting after us as he often does i believe so jacobi answered youve taken a liking to him havent you hes an honest man russie said simply sure enough blair stood outside the studio door talking animatedly with a handsome darkskinned woman who wore a plumcolored robe of filmy cottonfrom india moishe guessed though his knowledge of people and places oriental had almost all been acquired since he came to england blair broke off to nod to the two jewish broadcasters hope you chaps have been giving the lizards a proper hiding over the air he said i hope we did too jacobi answered his voice grave the princess and i shall endeavor to do the same blair said dipping his head to the woman from india his chuckle had a wheeze in it that russie did not like i think thats what they call an alliance of convenience a princess and a socialist joining together to defeat the common foe you wanted dominion status for india no less than i did the woman said her accent so different from moishes made her hard to understand for him he reminded himself to tell rivka and reuven hed met a princess not something a jew was likely to do in warsawor from what hed seen in london either india has more than dominion status these daysde facto if notde jure eric blair said its the rare and lucky ship that goes from london to bombay and even luckier the one that comes home again how are things there moishe asked one thing hed learned since coming to england was how narrow his perspective on the world had been he wanted to learn as much as he could about places that had been just names if that to him blair said you will not be surprised to learn that mr gandhi has made himself as unpleasant to the lizards as he ever was to the britishraj the aliens do not know how to deal with masses of people who will not fight them but also refuse to labor for them the princess said massacre has only made the mahatmas followers more eager to continue their nonviolent campaign against oppression and unjust rulefrom anyone that last bit would have brought out the censors razor blades and red ink had you tried to say it before the lizards came blair said he looked at his watch wed best get in there or we shall be late good to see you russie jacobi he and the indian woman hurried into the studio closing the door behind them the sun of early november was a cool pale fickle thing scurrying through the sky low in the south and scuttling behind every cloud and bit of mist that passed even so moishe faced the weather with equanimity in warsaw snow would have started falling a month earlier he said his goodbyes to nathan jacobi and hurried home to his soho flat having been separated from his family when the lizards invaded england made him appreciate them all the more but when he got up to the flat before he could even tell his wife hed met a princess she said moishe someone came round here looking for you todaya man with a uniform she sounded worried moishe didnt blame her that news was enough to worry anyone when he first heard it ice prickled up his spine he needed a moment to remember where he was this is england he reminded rivkaand himself nogestapo here nojuden heraus did he say what he wanted of me she shook her head he did not say and i did not ask hearing the knock on the door opening it to find the man with those clothes there she shivered and then he spoke to me in german when he saw i did not understand enough english to know what he needed that would frighten anyone moishe said sympathetically and took her in his arms he wished he could forget about the nazis and lizards both he wished the whole world could forget about them both the next wish that produced the desired effect would be the first someone knocked on the door moishe and rivka flew apart it was a brisk authoritative knock as if the fellow who made it had a better right to make it had a better right to come into the flat than the people who lived there its him again rivka whispered wed better find out what hes after moishe said and opened the door he had all he could do not to recoil in alarm after that except for the different uniform the man who stood there might have come straight off an ss recruiting poster he was tall and slim and muscular and blond and had the dangerous look in his eye that was calculated to turn your blood to water if you ended up on the receiving end of it but instead of shouting something likeyou stinking sack of shit of a jew he politely nodded and in soft tones asked you are mr moishe russie yes moishe said cautiously who are you captain donald mather sir of the special air service the blond young soldier answered to russies surprise he saluted ccome in moishe said his voice a little shaky no ss man would ever have saluted a jew not under any circumstances you have met my wife i think yes sir mather said stepping past him he nodded to rivka maam social amenities apparently complete he turned back to moishe sir his majestys government needs your help alarm sirens began going off in moishes mind he slipped from english back into yiddish what does his majestys government think i can do for it and why me in particular and not somebody else captain mather answered the second question first you in particular sir because of your experience in poland he left english too for german moishes hackles did not rise so much as they might have mather made an effort and not a bad one to pronounce it with a yiddish intonation he was plainly a capable man and in some notsoobvious ways i had lots of experience in poland moishe said most of it i didnt like at all not even a little bit why does anyone think i would want to do something that draws on it youre already doing something that draws on it sir in your bbc broadcasts mather replied moishe grimaced that was true the englishman continued making his german sound more yiddish with every sentence i will admit though we have rather more in mind for you than sitting in front of a microphone and reading from a prepared script what do you have in mind moishe said you still havent answered what i asked you i was coming round to it sir by easy stages donald mather said one thing you learned in poland was that cooperating with the lizards isnt always the best of notions if youll forgive your understatement no not always but if i hadnt cooperated with them at first i wouldnt be here arguing with you now moishe said saving yourself and your family mather began and my people russie put in without the lizards the nazis would have slaughtered us all and your people captain mather conceded no one will say you didnt do what you had to do when you joined the lizards against the nazis but afterwards you saw that mankind as a whole was your people too and you turned against the lizards yes to all of this moishe said beginning to grow impatient but what does it have to do with whatever you want from me i am coming to that mather answered calmly no matter how well he spoke that external calm would have marked him as an englishman in his place a jew or a pole would have been shouting and gesticulating he went on would you agree that in his majestys mandate of palestine no effort to exterminate the jews is now under way but rather the reverse in palestine moishe echoed the mention of the name was enough to make rivka sharply catch her breath moishe shook his head no you arent doing anything like thatnu here the multifarious yiddish word meantcome to the point he would have explained that to mather but the captain understood it on his own mather said the nub of it is mr russie that there are jews in palestine who are not content with british administration there and have been intriguing with the lizards in egypt to aid any advance they might make into the holy land his majestys government would like to send you to palestine to talk to the jewish fighting leaders and convince them to stay loyal to the crown to show them that unlike yours their situation is not so bad as to require intervention by the aliens to liberate them from it you want to send me to palestine moishe asked he knew he sounded incredulous but couldnt help it beside him rivka made an indignant noise he corrected himself at once you want to send usme and my familyto palestine he couldnt believe what he was saying occasionally in poland hed thought of emigrating of makingaliyah to the holy land but hed never taken the notion seriously no matter how hard the poles made life for a jew and once the nazis came it was too late now this englishman hed known for five minutes was nodding telling him the longhopeless dream of his exiled people could come true for him thats just what we want to do we cant think of a righter man for the job with a womans practicality rivka asked the next question how do we get there by ship donald mather answered we can get you down to lisbon without any trouble outbound from lisbon your freighter will meet a submarine to take you through the straits of gibraltar from the submarine youll board another freighter for the journey to haifa how soon can you be ready to leave it wouldnt be long moishe said its not as if we have a lot to pack that was if anything an understatement theyd come to england with only the clothes on their backs they had more than that now thanks to the kindness of the british and of their relatives here but a lot of what they had wouldnt come with themwhy bring pots and pans to the holy land if i came for you day after tomorrow this same time youd be ready then captain mather asked moishe almost laughed at him if they had to leave he and rivka could have been ready in half an hourassuming they found reuven and dragged him away from whatever game he was playing or watching a couple of days notice struck him as riches like those the rothschilds were said to enjoy well be ready he said firmly good until then mather turned to go wait rivka said and the englishman stopped she went on for how long would we be going toto palestine she had to fight to say the incredible word how would you bring us back and when as for how long youd stayfrau russie it would be at least until your husband completed his mission however long that might take mather answered once thats done if you want to return to england well arrange that and if you want to stay in palestine we can arrange that too we do remember those who help us i promise you that have you any other questions no he saluted did a smart aboutturn and headed for the stairwell moishe and rivka stared at each other next year in jerusalem moishe whispered jews had been making that prayer since the romans sacked the second temple almost nineteen hundred years before for almost all of them it expressed nothing more than a wish that would never be fulfilled now now moishe seized rivka together they danced around the inside of the flat it was more than exuberance he felt as if he could dance on the walls and ceiling as well as the floor rivka slowed sooner than he did she kept a firm grasp on the essentials of the situation saying they are not doing this for you moishetheyre doing it for themselves who are these jews conniving with the lizards anyhow i dont know moishe admitted what could i know of what goes on in palestine but i know this much if they want to play games with the lizards theyre making a mistake the british arent starving them and killing them for sport and that would be the only possible excuse for choosing the lizards youve seen that for yourself rivka agreed and then turned practical once more well have to leave a lot of these clothes behind the holy land is a warmer country than england so it is moishe hadnt been thinking about such mundane things to pray at the wailing wall he shook his head in wonder the idea was just starting to sink down from the front of his mind to the place where his feelings lived hed gone from stunned to joyful and the joy kept growing it was the first thing hed ever imagined that might improve on being in love it had seized rivka too to live the rest of our lives in palestine she murmured england here this is not badnext to poland even before the nazis came its a paradise but to live in a land with plenty of jews and no one to hate usthat would really be paradise who else lives in palestine moishe said once again realizing his ignorance of the wider world was both broad and deep arabs i suppose after poles and germans they cant be anything but good neighbors if reuven grows up in a country where no one hates him he paused to a polish jew that was like wishing for the moon but here even though he hadnt wished for the moon captain mather had just handed it to him they speak hebrew in palestine along with yiddish dont they rivka said ill have to learn ill have a lot of learning to do myself moishe said men read the torah and the talmud so hed learned hebrew while rivka hadnt but there was a difference between using a language to talk to god and using it to talk with your fellow menwhen i get to jerusalem ill find out what the difference is he thought and shivered with excitement it occurred to him then that he owed his chance of going to the holy land to the lizards before they came hed been one more jew among tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of others starving in the warsaw ghetto hed been out on the streets in dead of night trying to cadge some food to stay alive and praying to god to grant him a sign that he had not forsaken his people hed taken the sunlike glow of the explosivemetal bomb the lizards had set off high above the city as an answer to that prayer a lot of other people had taken it the same way almost willynilly theyd made him into their leader though becoming one had been the last thing in his mind because hed looked like a leader to his people hed looked like one to the lizards too when they drove hitlers thugs out of warsaw had it not been for them he would have stayed ordinary till the day he diedand hed probably be dead by now haltingly he spoke that thought aloud rivka heard him out then shook her head whatever you think you owe them you paid it off long ago she said yes they saved us from the nazis but they did it for themselves not for us they just used us for their own purposesand if it suits them to start killing us the way the nazis did they will youre right i think moishe said of course i am she answered he smiled but soon sobered rivka had repeatedly shown she was better at dealing with the real world than he was if she made a pronouncement like that he would be wise to take it seriously then all at once he started to laugh who would have thought that going to the holy land was part of the real world inside the landcruiser which was inside the heavy transporter ussmak was thoroughly shielded from the outside world what he was not shielded from was fear after all he and his crewmales had endured in britain he knew he would never again be shielded from fear he spoke into the intercom microphone how does your wound feel today superior sir getting better all the time nejas answered high time i was back on duty he hesitated perhaps making sure the crew of the transporter could not hear the next thing he had to say once he was sure they were out of the circuit he went on his words all at once quick and breathy do you by any chance happen to have anothertaste of ginger landcruiser driver im sorry superior sir but i dont have any even for myself ussmak answered he wished he hadnt had to start his commander tasting if he hadnt though he and skoob would have had to leave nejas behind the landcruiser commander would never have made it to tangmere and evacuation maybe none of them would have made it out of britain alive too bad nejas said oh too bad how i crave the herb as well you cant get it then superior sir skoob told him the gunner and commander had been crewmales since long before ussmak joined them skoob had earned the right to speak bluntly to his chief that filthy stuffs no good for any male believe you me its not hed said as much back in britain but he hadnt turned ussmak in to the disciplinarians once theyd escaped the chaos of evacuation and reached the relative safety of southern francerelative safety because even there the big uglies proved themselves able to lob poison gas at males and females of their own kind who labored on behalf of the race and skoob had turned both eye turrets away from nejas when his commander kept tasting while recovering skoob disapproved but was too loyal to do anything about it shame licked at ussmak like the flames from a burning landcruiser hidden away in the drivers compartment he had severalmaybe more than severaltastes of ginger he told himself hed lied to nejas because he didnt want to see the landcruiser commander plunge into degradation as he had done it was even trueto a degree but the main reason hed said he had no more ginger was simple and selfish in the extremehe didnt want to share it attention landcruiser crews the voice of the transporter pilot filled the audio button taped to ussmaks hearing diaphragm attention landcruiser crews we are beginning our descent to the landing please be alert for possible abrupt motions of the aircraft thank you thankyou very much ussmak muttered having first made sure he was not transmitting even to his crewmalesplease be alert for possible abrupt motions of the aircraft indeed hed flown into britain in a landcruiser aboard a heavy transporter he knew too well what that innocentsounding euphemism meant had the pilot wanted to be honest he would have said something likewe may have to dodge like maniacs because the stinking big uglies are doing everything they can to shoot us down what ussmak didnt know was how much the local big ugliescould do to shoot him down britain had been a dreadful place to fly into or out of not only was it a cramped little island but the locals had a great many killercraft some of them jetpowered and radar to help guide those killercraft to their targets no wonder then the transporters had taken such a beating over british skies here in the eastern portion of the sssr that part of the mission was supposed to be easier although ussmak had grown heartily tired of experts telling him things about the tosevites that soon turned out not to be so but hed fought in the sssr before if farther west and knew that the soviets while they made good landcruisers by big ugly standards lagged behind in other areas of the military art and lacked the doctrine to get the best results from the equipment they did have or rather he knew the sovietshad lagged behind in other areas of the military art andhad lacked proper doctrine he hadnt fought them in two of his years one of tosev s against his own people or the rabotevs or the hallessi that wouldnt have mattered for the mutable big uglies it was as good as an age fearfully he wondered what new destructive skills the soviets had learned while he was busy elsewhere on this planet suddenly he shuddered they were the ones who had used atomic weapons nejas said pilot how bad is the weather in the area to which were flying its cold landcruiser commander the pilot answered theres frozen water on the ground already for instance that seems to happen a great deal on this planet nejas said his tone halfway between weary resignation and making the best of things i dont suppose this siberia place can be too much worse than the rest last tosevite winter we were on duty in the southwestern part of the great land mass what the big uglies call africa skoob said that would have been downright pleasant if it hadnt been so damp it was warm enough anyhow which is more than you can say for a lot of tosev ussmak had spent most of the previous winter in a hospital ship recovering from radiation poisoning after hed had to bail out of his landcruiser into plutoniumcontaminated muck when the big uglies raided the area for metal for their nuclear devices the climate inside the ship had been salubrious enough getting there by way of radioactive mud was not a route he recommended though even through the steel and ceramic armor of the landcruiser in which he rode now ussmak could hear the roaring whine of the transporters turbofans he listened closely for any abrupt change in their tone and braced himself in his seat especially on its landing descent the huge clumsy aircraft wasnt much faster than a tosevite killercraft instead of feeling safe within the twin eggshells of transporter and landcruiser he felt doubly trapped a swing to the side set his heart pounding a moment later the pilot came on to say we are experiencing some violent crosswinds you males in there who cant see out nothing to worry about radar reports no tosevite killercraft airborne in our vicinity well be on the ground shortly what do you know skoob said good news for a change the emperor knows we could use some after the fiasco in britain nejas said he sounded like a male who needed a taste of ginger when you hadnt had any for a while the world seemed a grim place indeed ussmak had slowly learned that it was the herbor rather the lack of ittalking not the world itself some tasters took a long time to figure that out some never did the transporter jet jerked in the air ussmak jerked in his seat you didnt want to try to sit bolt upright youd smash your head against the roof of the drivers compartment he remembered just in time the pilot said flaps are down well be landing momentarily landcruiser crews prepare to roll out the cargo bay another jolt announced the landing gear coming down then the transporter hit the runway despite its bulk it bounced back into the air for an instant then rolled to a stop the turbofans screamed as they reversed thrust to help slow the enormous aircraft ussmak was eager to escape from the transporter tosev had too much water and not enough land but theyd just flown one of the longest alloverland routes possible on the planet he wanted to get out look around at his new duty area or as much of it as he could see through the vision slits of a landcruiser and more important still meet some of the males here and find out where he could get some more ginger after his present supply ran out the nose of the transporter swung up filling the cargo bay with light other than that of its own fluorescents the light was white and very cold driver start your engine nejas said it shall be done superior sir ussmak said and obeyed no sooner had he obeyed than nejas slammed the lid of the cupola down with a clang its a freezer out there he exclaimed worse than a freezer youd go into a freezer to warm up as if to support him the landcruisers heating elements came on hissing gently as they blew warm air through the interior of the machine when ussmak saw the male with a light wand who came up to direct the landcruiser out of the aircraft he believed every word nejas had said the poor guide had an electrically heated suit of the sorts pilots used in the chilly air of high altitudes and over it a hooded coat and boots made from the furry hides of tosevite animals in spite of all that he looked desperately cold as he waved the landcruiser ahead ussmak put the machine in gear and rumbled down the ramp snow blowing almost horizontally greeted him the landcruisers heater hummed as it worked harder he hoped it was made to withstand a challenge like this snow also started clogging his vision slits he flicked the button that sent a stream of cleaning liquid onto them it got rid of the snow but froze in place so it was as if he were trying to see out through a pane of ice careful nejas shouted you almost ran down the guide sorry superior sir ussmak answered if you have vision out your cupola command me he explained what had gone wrong with his own optics between them the male with the light wand and nejas directed ussmak to a point in front of a building he saw only as a large solid lump of snow in the midst of all the swirling stuff a door opened in the side of the solid lump the guide gestured were supposed to bail out and go in there i think nejas said i just hope we dont freeze to death before we make it with a single convulsive motion ussmak threw open the hatch above his head and scrambled out the cold was stunning his nictitating membranes drew over the surface of his eyes to protect them from the icy blast of the wind but he had to blink hard to make them return to where they belonged they had started to freeze in place his lungs felt as if he were breathing fire his skin burned for a moment too but then went cold and numb this way this way the guide shouted stumbling ussmak and his crewmales threw themselves at the entrance to the building it was only a couple of his own bodylengths away but he wondered if he would freeze into a solid block of ice before he got to it as soon as the landcruiser crew was inside the male who had guided them off the transporter slammed the door and dogged it shut then he opened the inner door to the chamber delicious warmth flowed out the chamber between the blizzard outside and the oasis of comfort within might almost have been a spaceship airlock as far as ussmak was concerned the environment from which hed just escaped was far more hostile than the unchanging vacuum of space new hatchlings the guide called as he went into the barracks room that seemed a tiny piece of home magically transported to tosev ive got some new hatchlings herepoor fools dont know theyve just been stuck up the cloaca of this miserable world males in the body paint of landcruiser and fighting vehicle crews crowded round ussmak and his companions welcome to siberia one of them called this place is so bad they say even big uglies got exiled here the ground is frozen half the year another male added the atmosphere doesnt freezeit just seems that way said a third ussmak had never run into such a cynical band of males they had to be ginger tasters he decided and felt better for a moment nejas waved his hands trying to get a word in edgewise where is this railroad were supposed to be interdicting how can we even move about in this hideous weather let alone fight the railroads south of here but not far enough to do us any good their guide answered weve broken it the trick is to keep the russkis from hauling anything across the break and shipping it one way or the other they have all sorts of animals and sometimes they even use motor transport when we come on one of their convoys its usually a massacre coming on them is the problem though another male said even radar has trouble seeing through these stormswhen its not frozen up that is yet another male said and we dont even have it too badwhen were out there were in our vehicles its the poor infantrymales i really pity they have to head out without a nice warm eggshell around them infantrymales skoob exclaimed how could you possibly go out there and fight on foot inthat and even if you could why would you because the russkis can said the male whod guided them if we didnt have infantry patrols out there the cursed big uglies would sneak within mortar range and start dropping their stinking bombs right down on top of our heads either that or theyd get into our vehicle parks and work the emperor knows how much havoc there theyve done both and they probably will again ginger or no ginger ussmak wanted to hide i thought nothing could be worse than britain and all that poison gas maybe i was wrong in a ragged chorus the guide and the other males in the barracks sang out welcome to siberia rance auerbach looked to the cloudy skies hoping for snow thus far his prayers had gone unanswered low dirtygray clouds hung over the prairie of eastern colorado but whatever snow or even rainhe would gladly have taken rainthey held refused to fall he waved to the troopers of his company urging them to spread out farther if a lizard helicopter spotted them they were on the way to becoming raw meat the winter before from all hed heard the lizards hadnt got so frisky so late in the year this time theyd sent a force west by helicopter to occupy cheyenne wells and were pushing infantry west along us to try to consolidate their position if they did that would put lamar due south of cheyenne wells down us in a hell of a bind worse still the next town west of cheyenne wells on us was called first view it was the place where the rockies first poked up over the horizon of the great plains in the rockies lay denver because hed traveled with leslie groves auerbach got the idea something important was going on in denver even if he didnt knowand had no business knowingwhat lizard thrusts that headed toward denver needed stopping no matter what the prairie seemed utterly empty but for his men and their horses turn those into buffalo and youd have things back the way they were before the white man camebefore the red man too come to that he turned in his saddle and called to bill magruder now i know what the indians must have felt like going up against the us cavalry back in my grandpas day his secondincommand nodded sitting bull licked general custer but look at all the good it did him in the end we cant just win fights now and again we have to win the whole shootin match auerbach nodded hed been trained to think in terms of campaigns which sitting bull certainly hadnt he wondered what sort of global strategy the lizards were trying to maintain theyd plainly had one at the start of their invasion but it seemed to have broken down in the face of unexpected human resistance as soon as his company passed sheridan lake auerbach waved them off us no tracked vehicle could match a horse for crosscountry performance so he told himself anyhow although the rule applied more in mountains and marshes than on the rolling plains near the kansas border but his troopers and their mounts would be harder to spot in the mix of stubble and unharvested crops than on the asphalt of the highway sir will you want to strike us east or west of arapahoe magruder asked auerbachs orders gave him discretion arapahoe lay about ten miles east of cheyenne wells close to the kansas line if he came to the highway west of the little town he risked drawing notice from the lizards whod been helicoptered into cheyenne wells if he reached the highway on the kansas side of arapahoe though he was closer to what had been the lizards main forward bases well go in to the east of arapahoe he decided after a few seconds thought the farther east we can damage them the more we draw their attention away from moving west which is what we want to try to do that operating as far east as possible made it easier for the lizards to damage him was something he tried not to think about he and his men camped for the night on an abandoned farm not far south of us when they set out the next morning they left their horses behind toting on their backs the supplies they needed as if they were infantrymen auerbach had scouts out he and most of his men sprawled in tall yellow grass while the scouts advanced to make sure no lizard patrols were on the highway he watched through field glasses as the scouts crept forward their khaki uniforms almost invisible against the brown earth and dying plants only when they waved did he go forward with the demolition team two men laid charges on the surface of the road connecting each one with the electrical detonator they ran wire back to a little gully a couple of hundred feet away and then crouching in it blew the charges the earth shook under auerbach chunks of asphalt rained down on the improvised trench somebody swore goddamn thing hit me right in the ass howard whose side you on anyway howard was the trooper whod pushed down the detonator plunger he said im on the good guys side reckon that leaves you out maxwell lets see what weve done auerbach got up and trotted over to us he nodded in solemn approval through swirling dust he saw theyd blown a crater across both lanes of blacktop anybody who sent a tracked vehicle down into it would get his teeth rattled nobody would try to send a wheeled vehicle into ityoud have to go around the demolition team finished their job in the area then became ordinary cavalrymenturnedfoot soldiers like the rest of the company auerbach positioned his men on the north side of us although that put the highway between them and their horses the ground rose toward the low ridge of the smoky hills there and offered better firing positions once the men had dug in there was nothing to do but wait he gnawed jerked beef and fidgeted he hadnt wanted to blow the road too close to cheyenne wells not least for fear the lizards there would respond before all his preparations were ready now he began to worry that they hadnt noticed the explosion at all bill magruder let out a hiss then said sir something coming down the road from the east auerbach peered in that direction something was a motor vehicleno a couple of motor vehicles that meant they were lizards all right he raised the field glasses to his eyes the vehicles leaped closer a couple of armored personnel carriers he grimaced hed hoped for one of those and a truck well you didnt always get everything you hoped for the carriershe would have thought of them as halftracks but the lizards fully tracked their machinesslowed when they saw the crater ahead auerbach kept a wary eye on their turrets they mounted light cannon not machine guns like american halftracks a lizard crawled out of a hatch and went up to the edge of the broken asphalt no one fired at him he got back into the machine auerbach waited to see what would happen next if the lizards decided to wait and send for a road repair crew a mighty good plan would have gone up in smoke after a moment several lizards emerged from the lead armored personnel carrier a couple of them scrambled up onto the deck behind the turret and unshipped a dozer blade which the others helped them fit to the front of the personnel carriers hull they were going to do a hasty job of road repair themselves the waiting cavalrymen did not interfere the lizards got back into the carrier it rolled off onto the soft shoulder of the road the dozer blade dug in to pick up dirt to fill in the hole in the road the engines note though quiet to anyone used to american armor got louder hunkered down behind a tumbleweed auerbach bit his lip and waited fingers crossed when the explosion came it wasnt as loud as the one that had blasted the crater in us but far more satisfying antitank mines carried a charge big enough to wreck a sherman that didnt always suffice to take out the tougher lizard tanks but it was plenty to ruin an armored personnel carrier smoke and flame spurted up from the vehicle which slewed sideways and stopped the right track blown off the road wheels hatches flew open like popcorn jumping up in a popper lizards started bailing out of the stricken machine now auerbachs cavalry company opened up with almost everything they had the lizard infantry men fell one after another although a couple made it to the ground unhurt and started shooting back the turret of the unhurt lizard personnel carrier swung north with frightening speed both the cannon and machine gun coaxial with it opened up on the machinegun position the americans had dug for themselves no the lizards werent fools auerbach thought as he fired at one of the males whod succeeded in escaping from his vehicle they went after the most dangerous enemy weapon first or rather they went after what theythought was the most dangerous enemy weapon auerbach had posted a twoman bazooka crew as close to the road as he dared about seventyfive yards away like antitank mines bazookas were iffy against lizard tanks frontal armor defeated the rockets with ease while even side or rear hits werent guaranteed kills but the ugly little rocket bombs were more than enough to crack open lesser vehicles an american halftrack would have become an instant fireball after a bazooka hit the hydrogen fuel the lizards used was less explosive than gasoline and they had better firefighting gear than the handheld extinguishers american halftracks and tanks carried that helped the lizards but not enough after a couple of heartbeats the lizards the bazooka round hadnt killed or maimed began to try to escape their burning machine as with the males whod left the first personnel carrier most of them didnt get away from the vehicle but some skittered off behind bushes and returned fire at auerbachs urgently shouted orders flanking parties moved out on both wings to envelop the lizards they had to be wiped out quickly or auerbach didnt want to believe he heard the rotor blades of a helicopter chewing their way through the air not so soon it was coming from out of the west from cheyenne wells his mouth went dry killing two infantry fighting vehicles was splendid but a bad bargain if it cost him his whole companyand himself fire rippled from the weapons pod under the belly of the flying beast the lizards didnt know exactly where his men were positioned but a rocket salvo made precision anything but mandatory auerbach dug his face into the musty ground as the rockets flailed the prairie blast picked him up flipped him onto his back and slammed him down hard through stunned ears he heard screams amidst the explosions nosemounted gatling twinkling like some malign star the helicopter bored in to finish exterminating the humans who had presumed to challenge the might of the lizards auerbach and his comradesthose still alive and unwoundedreturned fire he imagined the helicopter crew laughing in the cockpit their machine was armored against riflecaliber rounds perhaps because they were so close to us the bazooka team had not drawn the helicopters notice as it hovered not far from the burning armored personnel carrier an antitank rocket drew a trail of flame in the air toward it a bazooka was not supposed to be an antiaircraft weapon if it hit though it was going to do damage it hit the helicopter staggered as if it had run into an invisible wall up there in the air then it heeled over onto its side and crashed down on us for good measure the bazooka team put another round into its belly as it lay there ammunition started cooking off tracer rounds going up like fireworks lets get the hell out of here auerbach yelled his voice blurry even to himself a few lizards were still shouting but the americans made short work of them collecting the human wounded took longer and hurt more spiritually as well as physically auerbachs driving urge was speed he wanted to be away and under cover before the lizards sent any more aircraft after his men even if they nail the whole lot of us they wont have bought anything cheap today he muttered while that was undeniably true he still wanted to escape victory was a lot sweeter if you lived to enjoy it and once he go back to lamar hed have some fine stories to tell rachel hines and penny summers too returning to dover made david goldfarb feel hed stepped back into an earlier time in the war things had been simpler then with only the jerries to worry about and hitlers finest after all hadnt managed to invade england in spite of all thefuhrer s threats and promises dont worry hes coming but he and thewehrmacht hadnt come the lizards had basil roundbush came into the little room in the natural sciences building at dover college where the radarman was working the mustachioed pilot was whistling something whose words goldfarb didnt recognize whatever it was it sounded as if it ought to be bawdy working again with roundbush brought the months at bruntingthorpe back to the top of goldfarbs mind he looked up from his oscilloscope and said in mock disgust all the time i was playing at infantryman i felt sure youd be dead and out of my hair for good after a moment too long he added sir roundbush took the chaffing in good part with a grin that made him look like a lion that had just brought down its zebra he said dead something even worse than that happened i got promoted yes sir most illustrious flight lieutenant roundbush sir goldfarb cried springing to his feet to deliver a salute so vehement it threatened to snap off his arm oh put a sock in it roundbush said genially lets get down to work shall we right goldfarb said his sportiveness covered an admiration for the flier that fell only a little short of awe hed been through danger enough and to spare in his stint at ground combat his own fighting skill had had little to do with coming out the other side intact though bullets and shell fragments flew through the air almost at random if you were lucky they missed you if you werent you ended up dead or crippled but basil roundbush had survived flying mission after mission against the lizards while in an aircraft and with weapons far inferior to theirs luck undoubtedly had something to do with that but a fighter pilot unlike a groundpounder needed more than luck you had to be good at what you did or you wouldnt keep doing it long and roundbush had not merely survived the distinguished flying cross he wore on the front of his tunic testified to that he wasnt commonly given to boastingmost often when chatting up a barmaidbut goldfarb had heath hed brought down one of the lizards immense transport aircraft the ones that when roaring overhead looked as if they could carry a regiment they made the dakotas the raf had started getting from the americans not long before the lizards came seem like childrens models of wood and paper by comparisonand the dakotas had far outclassed anything the british had before them that kill had earned roundbush his dfc what hed said about it was to the point pack of ruddy fools back in london the lasses must hate them one and allthey think size is more important than technique even if it was the size of a whale the transport couldnt shoot back their fighter planes are another piece of business altogether goldfarb looked out at the rain splashing down from a leaden sky and said if the lizards had been smart they would have come now wed have been all but blind to them in the air what with the autumn clouds and mist and rain but their radars are good enough to let them carry on as if this were high summer they dont fancy cold weather roundbush said and ive heard it said they invaded us to get some of their own back after the reds lit off that explosivemetal bomb under their scaly snouts he snorted letting the politicians set strategy for their own reasons will make you sorry no matter whether youre a human being or a lizard now that weve won im glad they did it goldfarb waved to the electronic apparatus filling the shelves and tables of the room in which he and roundbush labored some of it like the gear theyd been analyzing at bruntingthorpe was wreckage but some was intact taken from aircraft and vehicles either captured after minimal damage or else abandoned in the retreat basil roundbushs wave was similar but more extravagant seeming to take in not just what was in the room but all the lizard equipment the british had captured he said as i see it we have two jobs of work ahead of us the first is putting to use the devices weve captured that are still in working order after that comes cannibalizing the damaged ones for parts so that say we can build two working ones from the hulks of four understanding how the bleeding things work as well as what they do might also be a good notion goldfarb observed to his surprise roundbush shook his head not necessary not insofar as what were about now the red indians hadnt the faintest notion how to smelt iron or make gunpowder but when they got muskets in their hands they had no trouble shooting at the colonials in america thats where we are right now we need to use the lizards devices against them understanding can come at its own pace the red indians never did understand how firearms work goldfarb said and look what became of them the red indians didnt have the concept of research and development and we do roundbush said for that matter we were on the edge of our own discoveries in these areas before the lizards came we had radar not so good as what the lizards use i grant you but we had ityoud know more of that than i and both we and the jerries seem to have been playing about with the notion of jet propulsion id love to fly one of their messerschmitts see how it stands against a meteor i wonder where fred hipple is these days goldfarb said and then more somberly i wonder if hes alive i fear not roundbush said he too sounded more serious than was his wont ive not seen the little fellow nor heard word of him since the lizards raided bruntingthorpe my guess is that he was one of the officers killed in the barracks he wasnt among those who reassembled afterwards that much i know well neither was i goldfarb answered i got separated in the fighting and ended up in the army theyd not have commandeered a group captain in quite so cavalier a fashion nor would fred hipple have been shy about pointing out the error of their ways had they made the attempt roundbush said then he sighed on the other hand they might not have listened to him no one paid the jet engine much heed before the war and thats a melancholy fact why not goldfarb asked do you know sir it seems so obviously a better way of doing things try as you will youll never tweak a spitfire to the point where it can match a meteors performance all true ive flown both i should know roundbush thought for a moment when he put his mind to it he was quite a clever chap he was also handsome and brave when goldfarb was in an intolerant mood he found the combination depressing roundbush went on a couple of things went into it i think we had a large investment in piston engines an investment not just in the factories that made them but also in close to forty years thinking they were the right and proper way to go about powering aircraft the other factor is piston engines wereproved by those forty years it takes a bold man or a desperate one to make the leap into the unknown and abandon the tried and true something to that i expect goldfarb said against the germans we could make gains by squeezing out an extra fifty horsepower here or a hundred there they were doing the same against us i expect or those jet messerschmitts of theirs would have started showing up over england a year ago and more but against the lizards its pretty clear we had to try something new or go under there you have it in a nutshell basil roundbush agreed now to business are we going to be able to mount these lizard radars in any of our aircraft theyre small and light enough thats certain and well finally be able to see as far as the lizards can i think it should be possible if we have enough sets goldfarb answered they dont draw a lot of power and weve figured out the voltage and cycles per second they useabout twothirds of the way from our standard down towards what the americans prefer we are still working to calibrate their ranges though and we still have to decide how many we want to mount on the ground to add to our air defense seeing the lizards counts there too thats so roundbush admitted reluctantly the other side of the coin is the lizards radar should be less susceptible to being tracked by their missiles and confused by their interference that matters a great deal when youre up past angels twenty it matters when youre on the ground too goldfarb remembered the opening days of the lizards invasion of earth when their missiles had homed unerringly on radar transmitters throughout the british isles knocking them out again and again try tracking their fighterbombers with binoculars if you want a treat for yourself binoculars old chap try tracking them with the mark one eyeball roundbush could also deliver a convincing impersonation of an overbred underbrained aristocratic twit of the sort who made bertie wooster seem a philosopherking by comparison now he leered horribly aiming a pair of mark one eyeballs rather bloodshot at goldfarb bit of a bore in the cockpit dont you know i know youre quite mad goldfarb retorted sir roundbush stopped twisting his features into that bucktoothed grimace and let his voice lose the nasal whine hed affected what i know is that i need a pint or three after we knock off today whats the name of that pub you dragged me to the one with the blonde and the redhead thats the white horse inn sir i dont think daphne the blond one works there any more she was just visiting old friends from what hed heard daphne was in a family way but he kept that to himself he hadnt done it and in any case hed been sweet on sylvia when last he was in dover the white horse inn thats it couldnt recall the name for love nor money roundbush coughed significantly only thing about the place im likely to forget though the beers not badmade locally id sayand that little redhead ah he kissed his fingertips like an actor playing a comic italian shes quite a piece of work she is cant argue with you there sir goldfarb had been trying to get back into sylvias good gracesto say nothing of her bedever since he returned to dover hed been making progress with the one if not the other now he waved a fond farewell to any hope of seeing the inside of sylvias flat again women had a way of throwing themselves at basil roundbushhis problem wasnt in catching them but in throwing back the ones he didnt want if he did want sylvia odds for anyone elses drawing her notice were abysmally poor sighing goldfarb bent low over the radar hed been working on when roundbush came in work couldnt make you forget your sorrows but if you kept at it you found yourself too busy to do much fussing over them in a world that showed itself more imperfect with every passing day that was about as much as any man had a right to expect because it was large and round the met lab crew had dubbed their first completed bomb the fat lady leslie groves eyed the metal casings curves with as much admiration as if they belonged to rita hayworth gentlemen im prouder than i can say of every one of you he declared now we have only one thing left to dobuild another one the physicists and technicians stared at him for a moment then burst into laughter and applause you had us worried there for a moment general enrico fermi said we are not used to unadulterated praise from you another man might have taken that for an insult groves took it in stride dr fermi when the war is over and the united states has won i will praise all of you to the skies and ten miles further till that day comes we have too much work to do to waste time saying nice things no one ever accused you of wasting time in this fashion leo szilard said drawing a fresh round of laughter from the met lab crew groves even saw a smile flicker on the face of jens larssen who had been more gloomy and taciturn than ever since he got back from hanford washington and found the whole program not only wasnt moving there but had moved on without him groves understood how all that could grate on a man but didnt know what to do about it it was in any case far down on his list of worries he knew what was at the top of the list i wasnt joking there my friends we had help with this bomb the plutonium we got from the british who got it from the polish jews who got it from the germans who got it from the lizards with help from the russians next time we make it all ourselves all by ourselves how long till the next bomb now that we have made the actual product once doing it again will be easier we will make fewer mistakes szilard said that drew nods from almost everyone groves included any engineer knew half the trouble in making something for the first time lay in figuring out what you were doing wrong and figuring out how to do it right we have almost enough plutonium for the second weapon now fermi said once we use it in the bomb though we will for a time be low but production is steady even improving with what we have now with the third atomic pile coming into full production from now on we will be manufacturing several bombs a year thats what i want to hear groves said the production numbers had told him the same thing but hearing it from the man in charge of the piles was better than inferring it from figures the next question is now that we have these bombs how do we place them where we want to use them szilard said he waved a stubby hand toward the fat lady this one would have to go on a diet before it could fit in an airplane and the lizards would shoot down any airplane before it got where it was going anyhow both those points were true the fat lady weighed nearly ten tons which was more than any bomber could carry and anything bigger than a piper cub drew the lizards immediate and hostile attention groves didnt know how to make a nuclear weapon small enough to fit into a piper cub but he did know that no matter what theluftwaffe thought you didnt have to deliver a bomb by air i promise you dr szilard we will manage when the time comes he said and let it go at that he didnt want everybody to hear what the delivery plans were security wasnt as tight as it had been with the japs and nazis to worry about he had trouble imagining anybody vile enough to want to betray american atomic secrets to the lizards but he was just an engineer and knew his imagination had limits what was unthinkable for him might not be for someone else how do we even get the thing out of the reprocessing plant a technician asked he worked at one of the piles not here where the plutonium was extracted and the bomb made groves just pointed to the wooden cart on which the fat lady sat it had wheels the technician looked foolish he neednt have moving ten tons was no laughing matter especially when those ten tons included complicated gadgetry and had to be moved in utmost secrecy groves had most of the answers now inside a week he needed all of them he was confident hed get them moving heavy things from one place to another was a technology mankind had had under control since the days of the pharaohs somebody said we got our bombs now how soon will the germans have theirs when will the russians set off another one what about the japs if there are no other questions class is dismissed groves said solemnly that got the laugh hed hoped for when it was over he went on the germans arent very far behind us if they hadnt had their ah accident they might be ahead of us the intelligence information on which he based that wasnt firsthand much of it came from things molotov had said when he was in new york where molotov had got it groves didnt know the russians had been wrong about the germans before generally to their sorrow groves also took special care in describing what had gone wrong with the germans first effort to set up a pile that went critical though the germans seemed to have been spectacularly careless about safety precautions it wasnt as if running a pile was an exact science things could go wrong here too what of the russians enrico fermi echoed they were first with their bomb but only silence from them sincea long silence now they say theyll be ready with another bomb come spring groves answered if i had to make a guess id say you shouldnt hold your breath waiting for them they got a jump start with the plutonium they and the germans stole from the lizards that was enough to give them the one bomb past that he shook his head russia simply does not have the precision industry technical skill or scientific numerical strength to come even close to manufacturing their own not yet how long do you think theyll need in almost identical words three people asked the same question oh i dont know maybe groves answered deadpan that got another laugh he didnt really think the reds would take that long but he didnt look for a new bomb from them next tuesday either and the japanese leo szilard asked as if he expected groves to forget what of them groves spread his hands dr szilard there i just dont know what to tell you they were on the track of something or the lizards wouldnt have blown tokyo off the map how much they knew how many of their top people got killed when the bomb hit how far theyve come toward rebuilding their programi dont know and id be lying if i said i did szilard nodded that is fair general so often people are in the habit of saying they know more than they do seeing a case where this is not so makes a pleasant change that was the first compliment groves had got from szilard in as long as he could remember he cherished it for that very reason for the sake of his own peace of mind though he wished he could give the hungarian physicist a more authoritative answer the japanese worried him before pearl harbor the united states hadnt taken japan seriously not a white man over there for one thing he thought but whether the japs were white yellow or bright blue their warships had proved as good as those americans made and their airplanes probably better bucktoothed slanteyed little bastards they might be but if you thought they couldnt fightif you thought they couldnt engineeryou had another think coming anything else he asked yeah said the technician whod asked him about getting the bomb out of the reprocessing plant how come that arrow that says this end up is pointing down at the floor what arrow groves blurted a split second before he realized the technician was pulling his leg wise guy he said through the laughter sent at him he didnt mind it he knew hostility aimed at him was sometimes what kept the crew working together and working hard that was fine as long as theywere working together and working hard he couldnt kick he walked out of the reprocessing plant to let the gang cuss at him when he wasnt there to hear it his breath smoked to the west the rockies were white it had snowed in denver more than once but not for the past week he hoped it would hold off a bit longer moving the fat lady with ice on the ground wasnt something he wanted to think about though he would if he had to actually getting the bomb moving wouldnt be such a problem stopping it though ice wasnt something pharaohs engineers had had to worry aboutlucky dogs he thought his office back in the science building wasnt what youd call warm either he refused to let it get him down like a bear before hibernation he had enough adipose tissue to shield him from the chill so he told himself at any rate he pulled an atlas off the shelf and opened it to a map of the united states the one thing you couldnt do without aircraft at least not easily was deliver a bomb to the heart of enemys territory you had to place the weapon somewhere along the frontier between what you held and what he did given the state of the war between humanity and the lizards that didnt strike groves as an insurmountable obstacle to using it effectively once the fat lady got aboard a freight car and headed out of denver where would they use it that wasnt his responsibility which would end when the bomb went onto the train even so he couldnt help thinking about it his eyes kept coming back to one place nowhere else in the whole country had a rail network that even approached the one going into and out of chicago the lizards had cut a lot of those routes of course but you could still reach the outskirts of town from the north or from the east and with all the fighting going on there you couldnt help but knock out a lot of lizards if the bomb went off there he nodded to himself chicago was a good bet probablythe good bet and where would they use the second bomb that was harder to figure where it would do the most good he hoped mutt daniels had known snow in chicago before hed been snowed out of an openingday series here in or was it he couldnt recall a hell of a long time ago whichever it was the cubs hadnt even been playing in wrigley field yet he knew that they were still over at west side grounds when it snowed in april though you knew things were winding down pretty soon it would be hot and muggy enough to suit you even if you were from mississippi now though winter looked to be settling in for a nice long stay no gas heat no steam heat not even a decent fireplace mutt grumbled i went through all o this last winter and i dont like it worth a damn too stinkin cold and that theres a fact im not saying youre wrong lieutenant sergeant muldoon said so dont make it out like i am but the lizards they like it even less than we do there is that its almost reason enough to get fond of snow but not quite if you know what i mean mutt sighed this here overcoat aint real bad neither but i wish i didnt have to wear it yeah muldoons overcoat was a lot more battered than the one daniels was wearing and smelled overpoweringly of mothballs mutt wondered if it had been in storage somewhere since the end of the great war the sergeant though was good at making the best of things he said we may not have a decent fireplace like you was talkin about lieutenant but lord knows we got plenty of firewood aint that the truth daniels said every other house in chicagosome parts of town every single housewas wrecked places where fire hadnt done the job for you you could burn a lot of wood staying warm the neighborhood in which the platoon was presently encamped was one of those areas where next to nothing was left upright since winter arrived the americans had pushed their front south a couple of miles the lizards werent grinding forward any more they were letting humanity come to them the price was ghastly one thing the cold weather did do it kept the stink of rotting flesh from becoming intolerable instead of just bad fighting back and forth across the same stretch of ground also produced a landscape whose like muttand muldoon toohad seen over in france in not even an earthquake shattered a town the way endless artillery barrages did in france though once you got out of a town you were back in the country again chewedup countryside was pretty bad too but it didnt have quite the haunted feel of stretches where people used to be crowded together and chicago wasnt anything but stretches where people had been packed close together one thing mutt said i dont believe in ghosts no more he waited for a couple of people to wonder why out loud then said if there was such a thing as ghosts theyd be screamin to beat the band at what we done to chicago and done to their graveyards in particlar i aint seen none o that so i reckon ghosts aint real off to the rear american artillery opened up mutt listened to the shells whistling by overhead that was a reassuring noise nothing like the roaring screech they made when they were coming straight at you they landed a couple of miles south of the house in whose wreckage he was squatting the explosions sounded flat and harsh not so big as they might have been mutt grimaced he knew the why of that so did muldoon gas he said as if tasting something sour yeah it was one of the big reasons the lizards had stopped advancing in chicago but that didnt mean daniels liked it nobody whod ever been on the receiving end of a gas bombardment liked the idea of gas all the hell we let loose on this city our own selves us and the lizards i mean maybe its no wonder we aint seen any ghosts by now i reckon theyre liable to be more scared of us than we are of them he scratched his head what the dickens was the irving berlin song from the last war stay down here where you belong thats itthe one where the devil tells his son not to go up to earth on account of it was worse there than it was down in hell maybe the devil knew what he was talkin about maybe he did muldoon nodded thing of it is though its either do what we gotta do or else have the lizards do somethin worse yeah daniels said again an that reminds meim gonna go up and check on the sentries just to make sure the lizards aint doin somethin worse right here sounds good to me muldoon said i sorta got fond of living all that time between the warsid like to keep on doin it a while longer now but you wanna watch yourself lieutenant the lizards they can see like cats in the dark i seen that already mutt agreed dunno whether its their eyes or the gadgets they got dont reckon that matters anyway they sure can do it and thats what counts most officers just useds mutt had been a noncom and a dogface too long to trust his neck to anything less than the best weapon he could carry if that meant he had to lug around the extra weight of a tommy gun he was willing to put up with it he paused a while outside the mined house where his men were sheltering so his eyes could adapt to the dark all around he didnt see like a cat and he didnt have any gadgets to help him do it either no moon in the sky and even had there been the cloud cover would have kept him from seeing it the only light came from the fires that turned parts of the skyline orange chicago was so big it never seemed to run out of things that would burn the lizards lines lay about half a mile to the south of the positions the americans were holding between them were both sides sentry posts along with american barbed wire and lizard razor wire coiling through the ruins of what had been middleclass homes not long before those ruins made the nomansland an even more dangerous place than it had been in france back in they gave snipers wonderful cover as if the blamed war isnt bad enough what with the gas and the tanks and the shells and the planes and the machine guns and all that other shitmutt thoughtbut no you gotta worry about some damn sniper puttin a bullet through your head while your damn underpants are down around your ankles so you can take a dump some things didnt change one of his grandfathers had fought in the army of northern virginia during the states war and hed complained about snipers too going out to the sentry positions mutt used a route hed worked out that kept him behind walls most of the way he didnt believe in making a snipers job any easier he had three or four different ways to get from the main line to the pickets in front of it and he didnt use any one of them more than twice running he made sure the sentries took the same precautions his platoon hadnt had a man shot going up to sentry duty in weeks a low but threatening whisper whos that daniels answered with the password cap anson how they hangin jacobs that you lieutenant the sentry let out a lowvoiced chuckle you give us those baseball names for recognition signals why dont you make em people like dimaggio or foxx or mel ott that weve heard of not some old guy who played way back when mutt remembered hearing about cap anson when he was a kid was that way back when well now that you mentioned it yes he said the lizardsll know about todays players they might fool you sure okay yeah but we can forget the old guys jacobs said then were liable to end up shooting at each other did i talk back to my officers in france like thatmutt wondered thinking back on it he probably had talked back like that american soldiers were a mouthy lot no two ways about it that had been true for a long time too and even more so a long time ago some of the things his granddads said theyd called the officers over them would curl your hair he sighed and said sonny if you dont want your buddies shootin at you you better remember thats all yeah okay sure lieutenant but jacobs quit bitching and stared out into the darkness what was that i didnt hear nothin daniels said but his voice came out as the barest thread of whisper his ears were oldtimers and knew it jacobs couldnt be a day over nineteen he had more balls than brains but he could hear mutt made sure he was under cover jacobs pointed at the direction from which the sound had come mutt didnt see anything but that didnt signify he picked up a fistsized lump of plaster hefted it in his hand be ready kid he breathed jacobs for a wonder didnt sayfor what he just took a firmer grip on his rifle and nodded mutt tossed the plaster underhand through the air it came down maybe thirty feet to one side clattering off what sounded like a brick chimney out in nomansland a lizard cut loose with his automatic rifle squeezing off a burst whose bullets whined through the area where the plaster had landed jacobs and daniels both fired at the muzzle flashes from the lizards weapon did we get him jacobs demanded shoving a fresh clip into his springfield damnfino mutt answered his ears were still ringing from the racket the tommy gun made it aint alwayshow do you say it cut and dried like that next thing we gotta do is we gotta find you a new position we just told em where this ones at okay lieutenant jacobs said i hadnt thought of that myself but it makes sense now that youve said it daniels sighed a long silent exhalation but he was used to thinking strategically and a lot of people werent we gotta be careful he whispered if we didnt get that son of a bitch of a lizard hell be out there waitin to nail us now if i remember straight there was a house over that wayhe pointed west with his right handmaybe a hundred yards thatd fill the bill lemme go check it out that lizard starts shootin at me keep him busy sure okay yeah lieutenant jacobs said throwing those words into varying combinations seemed to be his sport for the evening down on his belly like a reptile mutt slithered through rubble toward the house he had in mind part of its second story was still standing which made it damn near unique around these partsand made it a good observation point too at least till the lizards figured out somebody was up in it then they were liable to expend a rocket or a bomb just to knock down the place something skittered by a few feet in front of mutt he froze it wasnt a lizard it was a rat that much he saw his imagination filled in the resta fat happy rat like the ones hed seen in the trenches of france with a diet it was better not to think about he made it to the house he had in mind without getting shot at which he took as a sign if not a sure one that he and jacobs had hit the lizard wouldbe infiltrator the house seemed all right the stairway wobbled a little when you went up it but considering that half the second floor wasnt there he didnt suppose you could expect miracles and you could see a long way from the secondstory window he returned to the current sentry post and told jacobs everythings okay come on with me and ill show you where im moving you once hed installed the sentry in his new position he said ill go back and give your replacement word about where youll be yeah okay lieutenant jacobs said when mutt had almost made it back for the second time to the ruins where jacobs had been stationed the lizard out there in nomansland fired at him he dug his face into the dirt as bullets cracked all around him and ricocheted with malignant whines from stones and chunks of concrete sneaky little bastard aint you he muttered and squeezed off a burst of his own just to let the lizard know he was still among those present the lizard shot back they traded fire for a few minutes in a surprisingly sporting way then gave up mutt went back to his lines he wouldnt have been a bit surprised if the lizard did the same thing go on ahead lizardhe thoughtyou had your atbats this summer now that cold weathers here well throw your scaly ass right out of chicago just wait and see if we dont the tosevite hatchling rolled over on the floor of the laboratory chamber that had been its home since ttomalss had taken charge of it after a little while it rolled over again and then again all three rolls were in the same direction ttomalss thought the hatchling was beginning to get the idea of going some particular way any sign of neuromuscular progress in the little creature interested him since all such signs were few and far between by the standards of the race hatchling tosevites had no business surviving to grow up to become the big uglies who had proved such complete nuisances ever since the conquest fleet arrived were they to be separated from those who cared for them for the first years of their lives they could not survive the race had many stories of feral hatchlings who came from untended clutches of eggs and survived to adulthood most of them wellauthenticated among the tosevites such tales were vanishingly rare and even when told often had more of the feel of legend than fact something crinkledthe little female had got its hands on a crumpledup piece of cellophane that had fallen unnoticed off some work surface ttomalss bent quickly and got the cellophane out of the tosevites mouth that is not edible he said in what he hoped was a severe voice the hatchling laughed at him anything it could reach went into its mouth you had to watch it every waking momenta miracle all the big uglies didnt poison themselves or choke on things they swallow ttomalss thought he picked up the hatchling it had soiled itself again with a hissing sigh he carried it over to the table where he kept the wasteabsorbing or at least partially absorbing cloths it babbled cheerfully all the while some of the babbles were beginning to sound as if they were emulating the hisses and clicks that made up a good part of the races language those were nothing like the sounds it would have been hearing had it stayed among the big uglies its linguistic talents he suspected would prove very adaptable after he had cleaned it it gave the whining cry that meant it was hungry he let it suck from the bottle then walked back and forth with it as it fought a losing battle against sleep at last with a sigh of relief he set it down on the pad where it rested the emperor be praised he said softly when the hatching did not wake up since hed taken it up here he measured the time that was his own by the spaces during which it slept even when he left the laboratory he always wore a monitor attached to his belt if the big ugly started to squawk he had to hurry back and calm it he hadnt been able to trust any other males to do the job properly no one else had his unique and hardwon expertise no sooner had he taken a couple of steps away from the pad on which the hatchling lay than another psychologist a male named tessrek tapped with his fingerclaws on the doorjamb to the chamber to show he wanted to come in when ttomalss waved that he could enter he said how is the little tosevite treating you today mother his mouth dropped open in amusement at the joke ttomalss did not think it was funny by now hed heard it from a lot of his colleagues most like tessrek borrowed the wordmother from the tosevite language with which they were most familiar that seemed to make it doubly amusing for them they could imply not just that ttomalss was an egglaying male but one whod hatched out a big ugly he said the creature is doing very well thank you its definitely been displaying increased mobility and a greater sense of purpose lately it still couldnt come close to matching what a hatchling of the race was able to do the moment the eggshell cracked and hed been thinking disparaging thoughts about it only moments before but mocking the big ugly hatchling was mocking his chosen research topic and that he would defend as fiercely as he had to tessreks mouth opened in a different way to show distaste it certainly is an odiferous little thing isnt it he said have you any other pleasantries to add ttomalss asked his tone frigid he and tessrek were of identical rank which complicated matters as neither owed the other formal deference they had no social lubricant to camouflage their mutual dislike ttomalss went on my scent receptors do not record the odor to any great degree perhaps i have grown used to it that was at best a quartertruth but he would not let tessrek know it that must be because you have spent so much time with the creature tessrek said continual exposure has dulled your chemoreceptorsor perhaps burned them out altogether possibly so ttomalss said i have been thinking i spend an inordinate amount of time here with the hatchling i really do need someone to relieve me of creaturetending duties every so often not least so i can pass on some of the data i have gathered he swung both eye turrets toward tessrek as a matter of fact you might make an excellent choice for the role me tessrek recoiled in alarm what makes you say that you must be daft to think so by no means colleague of mine after all did you not study the tosevite male bobby fiore whose matings with the tosevite female brought into our spacecraft for research purposes led to her producing the hatchling here you have awhat is the term the big uglies use a family attachment thats it i have no attachment at all to that ugly little thing tessrek said angrily it is your problem and your responsibility at need i shall state as much to superior authority farewell he hurried out of the laboratory chamber behind him ttomalss mouth opened wide sometimes jokes had teeth as hed shown tessrek hed put forward his suggestion in an effort to make the other psychologists skin itch right down under the scales where you couldnt scratch but now that he thought about it it struck him as a pretty good idea he could use help with the tosevite hatchling and tessrek was the logical male to give it to him still laughing he picked up the telephone and called the office of the seniormost psychologist sam yeager paced back and forth in the army and navy general hospital waiting room he wondered how much experience the doctors had with delivering babies soldiers and sailors being of the male persuasion they werent likely to end up in a family way themselves how often had the medical staff here helped their wives lots and lots he devoutly hoped from the delivery room beyond the swinging doors came a muffled shriek it made him clench his fists till nails bit into flesh bite his lip till he tasted blood that was barbara in there straining with all her might to bring their child into the world part of him wished he could be in there with her holding her hand and reassuring her everything was all rightplease god let everything be all right another part of him was grimly certain hed either lose his lunch or pass out if he watched what she was going through he paced harder wishing he had a cigarette to calm him and to give him something to do with his hands hed actually smoked a couple of pipefuls up in southern missouri they grew tobacco around there but when word came that barbara was going to pop any day now hed hurried back to hot springs fast as horseflesh would carry him robert goddard had been good about letting him go he owed his boss one for that barbara shrieked again louder sams guts churned for a man to have to listen to his wife in agony just wasnt right but the only other things that came to mind were charging into the delivery room which he couldnt do and sneaking off somewhere like a yellow dog and holing up with a bottle of booze which he couldnt do either he just had to stay here and take it some ways going into combat had been easier then at least the danger had been his personally and hed had some small control over it now he couldnt do anything but pace maybe the worst was that he couldnt hear anything the doctors or nurses were saying in there only barbaras cries he didnt know whether she was supposed to be making noises like that were things going okay or was she in trouble hed never felt so helpless in his life he sat down in a hard chair and made a conscious effort to relax as if he were stepping into the batters box against some kid pitcher who could fire a fasthall through the side of a barnif he could hit the side of a barn he blanked everything but the moment from his mind took a couple of deep breaths his heart stopped pounding so hardthats better he thought barbara chose that moment to make a new noise not a scream exactly but cry and grunt and moan all mixed together it was a sound of supreme effort as if she were trying to lift the front axle of a car off somebody pinned underneath it sam bounced out of his seat all efforts at relaxation out of the park like a line drive off the bat of hank greenberg barbara made that appalling noise again and then once more after that for maybe a minute sam didnt hear anything please god let her be all right he mumbled he wasnt usually much of a praying man when he asked god for something it was something he really wanted then another cry came through the swinging doors a thin furious wail that said only one thing what is this place and what the devil am i doing here sams knees sagged it was a good thing he was standing next to that chair because he would have sat down whether or no the swinging doors opened outward a doctor came through them gauze mask fallen down under his chin a few splashes of blood on his white robe in one hand he held a crudely rolled cigar in the crook of his other elbow the littlest person sam had ever seen he handed yeager the cigar congratulations sergeant he said youve got yourself a fine baby boy here havent put him on the scales yet but hell be around seven and a half pounds hes got all his fingers all his toes and a hell of a good set of lungs as if to prove that the baby started crying again bbbb sam took one more deep breath and made himself talk straight barbara is she all right shes doing just fine the doctor said smiling do you want to see her when yeager nodded the doctor held out the baby to him here why dont you take your son in too your sonthe words almost made sams legs buckle again he stuffed the cigar into a trouser pocket and warily reached out for the baby seeing his inexperience the doctor showed him how to hold it so its head wouldnt flop around like a fish out of water now he could pass through the doors that had held him back before the delivery room smelled of sweat and of the outhouse a nurse was taking a bucket away from the table with the stirrups sam gulped birth was a process with no dignity to it his son wiggled in his hands he almost dropped the baby bring him here barbara said from the table they only showed him to me for a couple of seconds let me see him she sounded beat up she looked it too her face was pale and puffy with big purple circles under her eyes her skin glistened with sweat even though the delivery room wasnt what youd call warm if a guy caught two doubleheaders back to back on the same day in ninetydegree heat and ninetypercent humidity hed look a little like that when it was finally over sam showed her the baby the smile that spread over her face cut through her exhaustion like a sharp knife through tender steak give him to me she said and held out her hands you can nurse him now if you like the doctor said from behind sam in fact it would be good if you did there arent going to be many bottle babies not any more i suppose thats true barbara said before the war of the people i knew who had babies hardly any nursed theirs bottles seemed so much more modern and sanitary but if there arent any bottles she drew aside the sheet that was draped over the top part of her body for a moment sam was startled that shed bare her breasts to the doctor then he told himself not to be an idiot after all the fellow had just helped guide the baby out from between her legs barbara set the baby on her breast he knew what he was supposed to do if he hadnt known people would long since have been as extinct as dinosaurs he made little slurping noises just like the calves and lambs and piglets on the farm where sam had grown up what are you going to name him the doctor asked jonathan philip barbara answered sam nodded it wasnt the most imaginative way to name a kidafter his father and hersbut it would do the job had it been a girl they would have called it carol paulette for her mother and his he said i wish we had some kind of way to let our folks know we had a baby after a moment he added heck i wish we had some kind of way to let our families know were married or even that were alive i wish i knew whether my folks were alive or dead too from what i hear the lizards have been in nebraska just about since they landed what i wish barbara said sitting up and draping the sheet over her like a toga is that i could have something to eat i feel as if id spent the last two weeks digging ditches we can take care of that the doctor said in fact we should be taking care of that right about now as if his words were a cue a nurse came in carrying a tray that bore a huge steak a couple of baked potatoes a pumpkin pie and two large mugs pointing at those the doctor said i know they should be full of champagne but that is the best homebrew weve made yet call it a wartime sacrifice he pushed a little wheeled table next to the one on which barbara was lying since she was still nursing jonathan sam did the honors with knife and fork cutting alternate bites for her and himself as far as he could remember hed never fed anybody like that before he liked it by the way barbara smiled as she ate so did she she hadnt been kidding about being hungry either food disappeared off the plate at an astonishing rate the homebrew was as good and as potent as promised barbara said if the beer goes to my milk will it make jonathan drunk maybe the doctor answered if it does itll probably make him sleep better and i dont think youll complain about that sam wondered how theyd do a man a woman and a baby all in one room people did manage so he supposed they would then he remembered hed be going back up to missouri any day now that didnt seem fair either to him or to barbara but he didnt know what he could do about it no that wasnt true he did know what he could do about it nothing when they were done eating the nurse took away the tray sam waited for her to come back with a wheelchair for barbara then realized that wouldnt do any good not without the elevators running she cant walk upstairs to our room he protested oh she probably could the doctor said one thing you find out pretty fast is that people are tougher than youd imagine but were not going to let her you and i sergeant well get her up there they did too in a sort of modified firemans carry that had them both panting by the time they made it to the fourth floor the nurse followed with jonathan when they finally came out into the hallway barbara said if it werent for the honor of the thing id rather walk walk she did toward their room it was more shamble than stride her feet were as wide apart as if shed spent the last twenty years in the saddle while that wasnt true she had spent a good long while in the stirrups straha came out of his room to see what was going on in the hall he kept his body paint unsmeared and in the magnificent shiplords pattern hed worn when defecting no official american prisoner markings for him he came skittering up to the nurse she drew back a pace as if to protect the baby from him its okay sam said quickly were friends let him see jonathan the nurse looked dubious but held out the baby boy as straha examined it he looked dubious too this is a tosevite hatchling he said in his own hissing language it is a little ugly not a big ugly his mouth fell open in appreciation of his own wit barbara answered in the same tongue shiplord that ismy hatchling and it is not ugly for good measure she tacked on an emphatic cough yeager added one of his own to show he agreed among the lizards that was grammatically uncouth but it got the message across familial attachments straha said as if reminding himself no insult was intended i assure you for a tosevite hatchling this is undoubtedly a paragon whats he talking about the doctor asked he says weve got a cute kid sam answered he was skeptical about strahas sincerity but the lizard was too big a cheese for him to make a fuss over it besides except for an exaggerated sense of his own brilliance and worthhardly a trait unique to lizardshe was a pretty good fellow barbara returned to english i may be able to walk but i cant stand in one place very long im going inside and lying down she waddled the last few steps toward their door and started to go into the room the nurse followed with the baby before she got there ristin and ullhass came out to look over the new arrival they were politer than straha but still curious when jonathan opened his mouth to squawk ristin exclaimed the hatchling has no teeth how can it eat if it has no teeth barbara rolled her eyes if the baby did have teeth it wouldnt eat from me she said feelingly thats rightyou tosevites nourish your hatchlings yourself ullhass was more thoughtful less highspirited than ristin i am sure you will do everything you can to make this littleis it a male or a female this little male an upstanding member of your race thank you ullhass barbara said but if im on my feet another minute im going to be a downfalling member of my race she went into the room she and sam would now share with their son the nurse brought in the baby yall holier if theres anything we can do she said as she gave it to barbara good luck to you honey then she left and closed the door behind her all at once in spite of what the nurse had said it seemed to sam that he his wife and their child were the only people left in the world he gulped could he handle responsibility like that after a moment he realized the question hardly mattered he wouldnt get that much chance to handle the responsibility of being a father not when jonathan was here and hed be heading back up to missouri barbara set jonathan in the crib hed bought at a secondhand store in hot springs the crib wasnt very largeeven if it did crowd the alreadycrowded roombut the baby all but disappeared in it with a long shuddering sigh barbara lay down you all right hon sam asked anxiously i think so she said i dont know for sure though ive never done this before am i supposed to feel as if a steamroller just mashed me i cant tell you from what i know myself but by everything my mother used to say that is how youre supposed to feel thats good im going to sleep for a while i think while the babys resting and then if hes still asleep ill stagger down the hall and take a shower thank heavens the hot springs give us all the hot water we need because i dont think ive ever felt so greasy in my whole life that was hard work i love you honey he bent down and kissed her on the cheek then turned and shook a severe finger at jonathan and you buster keep it quiet for a while he laughed there im already showing our kid whos boss thats easyhe is barbara closed her eyes sam sat down in the one chair the room boasted barbara dropped off almost at once her slow deep breaths mixed oddly with jonathans quick uncertain ones the baby was a restless sleeper wiggling and thrashing and sometimes trying to suck at the sheets or the blanket that covered him every so often yeager got up to peer at him he tried to figure out whom the baby looked like he couldnt tell what jonathan mostly looked was squashed even his head almost came to a point at the top none of the doctors or nurses had got upset about that so sam supposed it was normal after an hour or so barbara woke up stretched and said isnt he a little angel sleeping like that i am going to get clean i wont be long pick him up and hold him if he fusses while im gone sam hadnt thought about that he was going off and leaving barbara on the spot for god only knew how long but she was a womanshe was supposed to be able to take care of babies what would he do if jonathan started crying jonathan started crying one minute he was quiet except for snorts and grunts the next he sounded like an airraid siren in the little room gulping sam picked him up careful to support his head as the doctor had shown him one thing immediately became obvious the kid was wet next to the crib stood a pile of diapers safety pins lay on top of the chest of drawers sam undid the diaper jonathan had on and discovered he was more than wet he had a mess in there too sam stared at it was it supposed to be greenish black he didnt know but figured hed assume everything was normal there too till he heard otherwise growing up on a farm had inured him to dealing with messes of most sorts he wiped his sons bottom which made jonathan fuss more then folded a diaper into a triangle and got it onto the kid he stuck himself with a pin only once which he reckoned a victory of sorts the doctors hadnt circumcised the baby he wasnt circumcised himself so that didnt bother himone less thing to have to worry about he thought jonathan kept fussing its okay kid it really is sam said rocking the baby in his arms after a while the cries subsided to whimpers jonathan drifted off to sleep ever so carefully sam put him back in the crib he didnt wake up sam felt as if hed caught a fly ball that clinched a pennant barbara came back a couple of minutes later is hestill asleep she exclaimed looking at the baby sam pointed to the galvanized bucket where hed tossed the dirty diaper i managed he said which with his ballpark thought of a little while before made him wonder how mutt daniels was doing these days the news coming out of embattled chicago lately was better than it had been earlier in the year but still not good i wish you didnt have to go back tomorrow barbara said that evening as they got ready for bed so do i sam passed her the cigar the doctor had given him they were sharing it for a treat but i cant do anything about that im just lucky dr goddard was a good enough guy to let me get down here at all by the time he crawled out of bed the next morning sam wasnt so sure he was sorry to go he wondered if it might not be more like an escape hed expected jonathan to wake several times in the night and the baby did whenever he roused barbara nursed him what he hadnt expectednor barbara either by her increasingly haggard lookwas that the baby could wake them without waking up him self every little snort or grunt or slurping noise jonathan made would bring his parents alert their eyes wide wondering what they needed to do next often the answer wasnothing but they couldnt know that in advance as he put on his khakis shirt and jacket sam felt himself moving as if underwater barbara looked to be in worse shape than he was jesus he said his voice a rusty croak i wish there was coffee oh so do i barbara said fervently she managed a wan smile one thing about the shortages though i dont have to worry about your falling asleep at the reins of your horse and driving him into a tree or a ditch something to that sam said not much but something he hugged her then smiled himself i dont have to lean over your belly any more thats pretty good im still all barbara gestured i hope ill have my figure back when i see you again she shook her head no i dont because that would mean i wont see you for a while and i want you back here as soon as you can come i love you sam and besides jonathan needs to know who his daddy is yeah the baby was asleep for the moment yeager kissed the tip of his own finger and brushed it against jonathans cheek so long kiddo he hugged barbara again so long hon love you too sighing he lurched out the door and headed down the hall to the stairs from behind him straha called in peremptory tones i must tell you that your hatchlings howls last night disturbed me and i have no doubt other males of the race on this floor how long can we expect this unseemly cacophony to continue oh about six months more or less sam answered cheerfully thats one of your years isnt it so long im going back to missouri away from the noise he ducked down the stairway leaving the shiplord staring after him georg schultz spun the us prop the fivecylinder shvetsov radial engine caught at once being aircooled it was less susceptible to cold weather than a lot of aircraft powerplants when the weather got cold enough oil didnt want to flow but it wasnt quite that bad today it had been on and off and ludmila gorbunova had no doubt it would be again before long schultz got out of the way in a hurry ludmila released the brake and let thekukuruznik bounce down the rutted dirt of the airstrip when shed built up enough speed she pulled back on the stick and clawed her way into the air getting the little biplane off the ground always made her feel that if you wanted to badly enough you could run along with your arms spread and take off and fly all by yourself the slipstream that came over the windscreen threatened to freeze her cheeks and mouth the only flesh she bared to it she went into a wide turn and flew over the airstrip on her way south georg schultz was already out of sightprobably on his way to tatiana s bed ludmila thought scornfully but he was right she really had no business complaining she didnt want him and was just as glad to have him out of her hair once and for all she buzzed over the defense lines south of pskov built with such unflagging and dreadful civilian effort the summer before soldiers in the trenches waved at her and as happened fairly often a couple of fools shot at her not believing anything built by human beings could be in the air she saw muzzle flashes heard a couple of bullets crack past who do you think i am the devils grandmother she shouted that helped relieve her own feelings but the men on the ground couldnt hear her sometimes when bullets came closer than they had today she thought longingly about machinegunning the trenches of her own side then she was over the lizards lines she gunned the u for all it was worth but that as she knew only too well was a matter of kopecks not rubles a couple of lizards shot at her too they didnt come any closer than the russians had that wasnt what worried her theyd use their radios to let their side know she was out and flying and the lizards had antiaircraft weapons far more deadly than automatic rifles once she was past the lizards main line she swung thekukuruznik s nose west then south then west again then north for a little ways and then east for an even shorter time the less predictable she made her path the less likely they were to blow her out of the sky some kilometers south of the lizards forward positions she spotted a convoy of tanks and softskinned vehicles slogging along a dirt road now that snow had replaced the fall rains roads were passable again what had been mud was frozen solid that wasnt what drew her notice to the convoy though the tanks and lorries werent moving up to help the lizards advance on pskov instead they were heading south themselves away from the city they had artillery with them too some selfpropelled and some towed weapons captured from the red army and the germans she didnt get too close to the convoy a lot of those vehicles mounted machine guns for defense against lowflying aircraft and her best hope for surviving such a barrage was not drawing it in the first place as soon as she was sure they really were southbound she flew away as fast as the u would take her whatare they doing she wondered aloud had she not been wearing thick gloves and a leather flying helmet she would have scratched her head shed never seen such a largescale withdrawal by the lizards before she skimmed along a few meters above the treetops drawing occasional potshots from the woods below but was gone before the lizards could do her any damage she was thinking hard the evasive maneuvers shed performed south of the lizards lines had left her a trifle disoriented but if she was where she thought she was she ought to strike another road if she flew southeast for a couple of minutes and there it was like most roads between soviet cities it was dirtsurfaced but it also had lizard armor on it and lorries with the tanks and fighting vehicles this was a bigger column than the one shed seen before and also heading southsouthwest actually given the direction of the highway which ran toward daugavpils in what had been latvia till the soviet union reclaimed it a couple of years before whatare they doing she repeated but that seemed pretty obvious they were pulling back from pskov or at least pulling back the forces with which they could advance farther rather than merely holding in place she found another question why are they doing it she didnt think it was because theyd despaired of conquering pskov they had to want the armor somewhere else where she had no idea and it wasnt her job to worry about such things anyhow but she needed to get the information to someone whose jobwas worrying about them not for the first time she wished thekukuruznik had a radio she sighed a lot of soviet aircraft and tanks went without radios that saved the expense of building and installing them and the trouble of training personnel who were liable to be illiterate peasants just off the farm whether such economies were worth the disadvantage of being without good communications was another question entirely when she bounced in for a landing outside pskov no soviet groundcrew men waited for her the possibility that she might come back early had never entered their minds she taxied as far from the concealed airplanes as she could leaving her own at the very edge of the trees with luck the lizards would be so intent on their retreat that they wouldnt notice thekukuruznik without lucknichevo ludmila said it cant be helped she hurried into pskov by the time she got to thekrom she was sweating if anything would keep you warm flight gear would she almost ran into george bagnall as he was coming out whats going on he asked in his bad russian she poured out the story first in russian and then when she realized she was going too fast for him to follow in german instead and so i must seegeneralleutnant chill and the soviet brigadierssofort immediately she finished german was a good language in which to sound urgent if you didnt get your way it seemed to warn something terrible would happen but bagnall only noddedda they all need to know that he said and setting a hand on her shoulder to show she was with him he marched her through layers of sentries and subordinates to the commandments of pskov she told them the story in the same mix of languages shed used with bagnall aleksandr german translated from the russian for kurt chill and from the german for nikolai vasiliev the leaders were as excited as ludmila had been vasiliev slammed a fist down on the tabletop we can drive them far from our city he shouted theyre already going chill said whereare they goingand why we must have more intelligence reports i shall order up additional flights he reached for a field telephone until they got more data the commanders werent about to order anything irrevocable which struck ludmila as sensible she and bagnall both withdrew he said you did well to come back so soon you showed a lot of he had trouble with the word both in russian and in german finally after some fumbling ludmila decided he was trying to sayinitiative she shrugged it needed doing so i did it only after the words were out of her mouth did she realize that was unusual at least among the soviets you did what you were told and nothing else that way you never got in trouble from what shed seen the germans were looser more demanding of imagination from their lower ranks she didnt know how the english did things das ist guthe said and then repeated himself this time in russiankhorosho ludmila supposed that meant he thought initiative was a good thing too like a lot of soviet citizens she mistrusted the concept how could social equality survive if some people shoved themselves ahead of the rest coming out of the gloomy confines of thekrom took such ideological concerns from her mind the sun had escaped the clouds while she was passing her news on to the local commanders it gilttered off the snow on the ground and made the whole world dazzlingly white the day wasnt warmthey wouldnt see a warm day for monthsbut it was beautiful bagnall must have felt it too he said shall we walk along the river ludmila looked at him out of the corner of her eye yes he definitely believed in initiative after a moment she smiled well why not she said maybe she had a weakness for foreign men something that struck her as vaguelywell not so vaguelysubversive then she shook her head georg schultz was foreign but shed never had the slightest yen for him maybe she had a weakness forkulturny men in the soviet union she sometimes thought they were almost as hard to come by as foreigners the pskova river was frozen over ice stretching from bank to bank here and there men had cut holes in it and were fishing a couple had plump pike and bream out on the ice to show their time wasnt going to waste fish here keep fresh all winter long bagnall said well of course ludmila answered then she paused england was supposed to have warmer winters than the soviet union maybe it wasnt anof course for him after a while he stopped and looked across the river which church is that he asked pointing i think that is the one they call the church of sts cosmas and damian on gremyachaya hill ludmila answered but i ought to be asking you these things not the other way round you have been in pskov much longer than i have thats true he said and laughed in some embarrassment but its your country after all so i think you should know these things easy to forget you could drop england anywhere in the soviet union and it would disappear ludmila nodded after the lizards came i flew once into sweden and denmark and germany she didnot say shed taken molotov to berchtesgaden everything seemed so small and so soused here we have more land than we know what to do with i have seen it is not like that all over the world no hardly bagnall said with us the trouble is finding the land to do all the things we want to do with it he hesitated then laughed he had a good laugh even when he was laughing at himself he sounded genuinely amused he went on here i am with a pretty girl and im talking about churches and land i must be getting old ludmila looked up at him he was a few years older than she buti do not think you are ready for the dustbin yet she said she didnt know how to saydustbin in german and getting it across in russian took almost as much work as his trying to makeinitiative comprehensible when he finally understood he laughed again and said then it must be my young fiery blood that makes me do this he slipped an arm around her shoulder when georg schultz tried putting his hands on her shed always got the feeling she had to shake him off right away that if she didnt he would tear off whatever she happened to be wearing and drag her to the ground bagnall didnt give the same impression if she said no she thought hed listenyes i do like kulturnymen because she thought she could say no any time she wanted to she didnt say it right away that emboldened bagnall to bend down and try to kiss her she let his lips meet hers but after a moments hesitation she didnt kiss back schultz wouldnt have noticed or cared if by some chance he had noticed bagnall did he said whats wrong when ludmila didnt answer right away his brow furrowed in thought then he smote his forehead with the heel of his hand a gesture shed seen him use before im an idiot he exclaimed you have someone else dashe said and in an odd sort of way it was true though all she and heinrich jager had together was time best measured in hours and a couple of letters then to her amazement and dismay she burst into tears when bagnall patted her shoulder this time it was in pure animal comfort no perhaps not quite pure anyone who finds someone else attractive will always have mixed motives in touching that person but he was doing the best he could whats wrong he asked again you dont know if hes all right no i dont know that she said i dont know very much at all she looked up at his long face set now in lines of concern she would never have told her story to a countryman speaking to a foreigner somehow felt safer and so in a torrent where russian soon swamped her german she poured out what shed hidden from everyone for so long by the time she was done she felt as if shed been flattened by a train bagnall rubbed his chin bristles rasped under his fingers both razors and hot water for shaving were in short supply in pskov the raf man uttered something in english that meant nothing to ludmila seeing as much bagnall dropped back into his mix of german and russian you dont do anything the easy way do you nyetshe scanned his face trying to figure out what he was thinking it wasnt easy what they said about englishmen was true whatever went on inside their heads they kept it to themselves at least he hadnt called her a traitor and a whore for ending up in the germans bed when they found each other in berchtesgaden that was something slowly bagnall said you must know something of what the fair tatianadie schone tatianahe called her which made ludmila smile in spite of herselffeels because she is carrying on with georg schultz yes perhaps so though i dont think shed give me much sympathy ludmila didnt think tatiana gave anyone much sympathy she looked bagnall in the eye now you know why i cannot do not want tohow did you say it carry on with you and sowhat areyou thinking your face is as quiet as molotovs yes i see that bagnall answered he didnt sound happy about it either ludmila felt obscurely good about that even though shed just told him she didnt want to have an affair with him picking his words with care he went on your german had best be a good man if he is to be good enough to deserve you your germanludmilas guilt came flooding back even after a year and a half of uneasy alliance with the nazis against the lizards the memory of the war against hitlers invading minions would not go away but the rest of itludmila stood on tiptoe and kissed bagnalls whiskery cheek thank you she whispered he chuckled a little uncomfortably if you do that sort of thing you will make me forget my good intentions with you i will take the chance there was a notion believers had one ludmila a thoroughgoing atheist had always scorned now though for the first time in her life she understood the idea of absolution no matter that an englishman rather than a priest had given it to her given her own secular beliefs that only made it better the fellow who made his living exhibiting dung beetles was talking so fast and so excitedly nieh hoting could hardly follow him they loved it loved it i tell you he exclaimed gulping down one glass after another ofsamshu the potent tripledistilled brew made fromkaoliang millet beer they paid me three times as much as i expected and they want me to come back again as soon as i can he stared at nieh in sodden gratitude thank you so much for arranging my performance before them hou yi it was my pleasure nieh hoting said expansively anything i can do to make the lives of the little scaly devils more pleasant that i shall do he smiled then they pay me which makesmy life more pleasant hou yi laughed a loud sozzled laugh he poured the last few drops from the jar ofsamshu into his cup then lifted a finger to show he wanted another after a while a girl brought it to him he was drunk enough to pat her on the backside by way of showing thanks she made a face as she hurried away she might well have been available but making a show of that demeaned her nieh let hou freshen his cup ofsamshu too the tavernit was called theta chiu kang the big wine vatwas only a couple of blocks from his rooming house but he assumed an altogether different persona here instead of being the scaly devils staunchest foe he acted the part of a mediumimportant tout for them someone who was always looking for new ways to keep them entertained thanks to the connections the peoples liberation army had with men and women in the little devils employ he had no trouble living up to the role theta chiu kang was different from his usual haunts in other ways besides the part he played heremo tan kuo shih a sign announced do not talk politics every time he looked at it nieh snickered in a revolutionary situation all speech was political speech as if to underline that a smaller banner below the sign readplease keep your honorable mouth shut in less inherently futile fashion other signs declaredcash only andno credit hou yi said the little devils want me back oh i told you that didnt i well they do one of them told me as much as i was capturing my bugs and getting ready to go can you arrange it for me arrange it for you my friend i can do better than that nieh answered do you know what ive learned the little scaly devils want to make films of some animalshow performancesofyour beetle showso they can show them far away from here in countries where the foreign devils have no such shows before you go to them next time you will visit me and i will fix a special camera from the scaly devils inside your case it will take just the pictures they need by some magic i am too ignorant to understand hou yi goggled at him then bowed his headand almost banged it on the top of the table you are much too generous to me i am unworthy of such an honor nieh knew that was politely insincere nonsense he said the little scaly devils demanded it of methey insisted i tell you could i say no to my masters especially when i know what enjoyment you give them this is wonderful wonderful hou yi babbled i am your slave for life he looked close to the maudlin tears of drunkenness just remember nieh said no idle warning in view of the show mans condition before your next performance in front of the little scaly devils you come to me with your case of insects and i will mount the camera inside do not act as if you know it is there the little devils want you to put on your show exactly as you would otherwise i shall obey you as a dutiful son obeys his father hou yi giggled belched set his head down on the table where he and nieh ho ting were drinking and went to sleep nieh looked down on him then shrugged and left coins on the table to pay for thesamshu they had been drinking he walked out of the big wine vat and into the maze of pekingshutungs torches and candles and lanterns and the occasional electric light made the alleys almost as bright as day nieh used every trick he knew to make sure no one was following him before he made his way back to the rooming house where the communist cause flourished sitting in the dining room there was hsia shoutao to niehs relief his aide was alone he never stopped worrying that one of the tarts hsia brought back here would prove to be an agent of the scaly devils or the kuomintang or even the japanese hsia simply was not careful enough about such things in front of him stood a jar ofsamshu identical to the one from which hou yi had been drinking he also had plates with crackers and meat dumplings and pickled baby crabs and a salad of jellyfish and gelatin when he saw nieh he called come join my feast theres enough here for two to celebrate ill gladly do that nieh said waving to the serving girl for a cup and a pair of chopsticks what are we celebrating you know yang chuehai the mouse man the little scaly devils liked his act and they want him back he says they didnt do a careful search of the cages he carries his mice in either we shouldnt have any trouble planting our bomb inside there hsia slurped at hissamshu ahh thats good nieh poured himself a cup of the potent millet liquor before he drank he ate a couple of crackers and a pickled crab that is good news he said as he finally lifted his cup hou yi one of the fellows who shows dung beetles told me the same thing we can get bombs in amongst the little scaly devils that much seems clear the real trick will be to have them invite all the beastshow men at the same time so we can do them as much damage as possible youre not wrong there hsia said with a hoarse raucous chuckle cant use the beastshow men more than once either poor foolish fellows once should do the job though he made a motion of brushing something disgusting from the front of his tunic to hsia the beastshow men were to be used and expended like any other ammunition nieh was just as willing to expend them but regretted the necessity the cause was important enough to use innocent dupes to further it but he would not forget the blood on his hands hsia didnt worry about it the other thing we need to make sure of is that we have good timers on all our explosives nieh said we want them to go off as close to the same time as we can arrange yes yes grandmother hsia said impatiently hed had a good deal to drink already unless nieh was much mistaken i have a friend who is dickering with the japanese outside of town from what he says they have more timers than they know what to do with i believe that nieh said with the coming of the little scaly devils to china japanese forces south of their puppet state in manchukuo were reduced to little more than guerrilla bands and unlike the communist guerrillas did not enjoy the protection of the populace in which they moved too many atrocities had taught the chinese what sort of soldiers the japanese were but japan was an industrial power it had been able to manufacture for its troops all sorts of devices the chinese unable to produce the like locally had to beg borrow or steal they had got materiel from the british the americans and the russians but now both capitalist imperialists and fraternal socialist comrades were locked in their own struggle for survival that left the japanese remnants as the best source for advanced munitions nieh said a pity the little scaly devils did not wait another generation before beginning their imperialist onslaught the spread of industry over the world and the advance of revolutionary progressive forces would have made their speedy defeat a certainty hsia shoutao reached for a dumpling with his chopsticks they crossed in his fingers leaving him with a confused expression on his face if he was too drunk to handle them properly he had indeed had quite a lot ofsamshu he said well beat them anyway and the damned eastern dwarfs from japan and the kuomintang and anybody else who gets in our way he tried for the dumpling again and succeeded in capturing it he popped it into his mouth chewed swallowed jus likethat nieh thought about lecturing him on the difference between somethings being historically inevitable and its being easy to accomplish but concluded hed be wasting his breath hsia didnt need a lecture what he needed was a bucket of cold water poured over his head hsia belched heroically from confused his face took on a look of drunken foxiness you think liu han is going to get her brat back he asked breathingsamshu fumes across the table into nieh ho tings face that i dont know nieh said like any scientific doctrine the historical dialectic considered the motion through time of mankind as a mass the vagaries of individuals were beneath its notice leering hsia found another question you get inside her jade gate yet none of your business nieh snapped how did hsia know he wanted her he was sure hed been discreetbut evidently not discreet enough his aide laughed at him that means no looking at hsia shoutaos red mirthfilled countenance nieh decided hsia didnt need just a bucket of water poured over him clobbering him with the bucket afterwards seemed a good idea too kirel stood beside atvar and studied the evolving dispositions of the races infantrymales and armor for a moment one of his eye turrets slid away from the map and toward his superior exalted fleetlord this had better work he said i am aware of that yes atvar answered he was painfully aware of it and having kirel remind him of it so bluntly didnt make him feel any easier about what hed set in motion if spirits of emperors past look down on us in approval we shall smash deutschland once for all kirel did not say anything but his tailstump twitched a little so did atvars in irritation he could read his subordinates thoughts not so very long agothough it seemed an agehed promised to smash britain once for all that hadnt worked out in spite of hurting the british the race had hurt itself worse and britain remained in the war this time it will be different the fleetlord insisted this time our logistics are far better than they were for the invasion of that pestiferous island he brought up highlights on the map instead of having to fly males and materiel long distances to bring them into the battle we shall be operating from our own longestablished strongholds on either side of the deutsche from france and poland we shall move forward with both forces and crush the big uglies between us so the operational planners have maintained kirel said so they would maintain the better to underline their usefulness to our efforts if reality matches the computer simulations this operation will succeed but how often exalted fleetlord does reality match simulations on tosev we know what the deutsche have atvar said we have even extrapolated that they will have some new weapons with performance improved over those with which we are familiar when dealing with the big uglies as you say an upward slope on the projection line seems as reasonable as one that is flat for us even given that though the projections show us beating them do the projections take into account the wretched weather on that part of the planet at this time of its year kirel stroked computer keys a corner of the screen that displayed the simulations map went first to a satellite image of endless storm systems rolling east from deutschland toward poland and then to a video of wind whipping crystallized frozen water across a desolate landscape that resembled nothing so much as the inside of some tremendous refrigeration plant our males and our equipment do not perform at optimum levels in such conditions truth but we have improved over our levels during the previous local winter atvar said stoutly and the cold ironically also hinders the activities of the deutsche their poisonous gases are far less effective now than when the weather is warmer weve also succeeded in developing filters to keep most gases out of the interior compartments of our fighting vehicles this will boost both performance and morale except perhaps among the infantrymales still compelled to leave their fighting vehicles from time to time and perform their duties in the open kirel said atvar sent him a dubious look ever since strahas attempted coup kirel had been scrupulously almost ostentatiously loyal unlike straha he did not believe in adventure for its own sake indeed he hardly believed in adventure at all as witness his protests against the upcoming campaign but his very conservatism a quality that endeared him to most males of the race might yet make him the focus for disaffected shiplords and officers atvar had enough troubles worrying about the political effects on his campaign on the big uglies when he also had to worry about its political effects on his own males he sometimes thought be was having to bear too heavy a burden let us look at the benefits of success he said with deutschland defeated the whole northwest of the main continental mass comes under our control we gain improved positions for any future assaults whether by air alone or with ground forces against britain we go from active combat to pacification over that whole area freeing up troops for operations elsewhere and the psychological impact on the remaining tosevite notempires will be profound truth all of it exalted fleetlord kirel said but as the saying goes to get the hatchling you first must have the egg atvars tailstump lashed harder now let us not mince words shiplord he said coldly do you advise me to abandon this planned effort or shall we go forward with it proceeding in the face of your obstructionism is difficult i obstruct nothing exalted fleetlord kirel said almost involuntarily he hunched down into the posture of obedience i merely question methods and timing to obtain the best possible results for the race have i not labored long and hard to support the implementation of this plan truth atvar knew be sounded reluctant to admit as much but he couldnt help it externally kirel had done as hed said the fleetlord had been inferring the thoughts behind his actions maybe he was wrong he hoped he was sighing he said blame it on tosev shiplord anything that has anything to do with this cursed planet goes wrong one way or another exalted fleetlord there we agree completely kirel said as soon as we detected radio signals from it we should have realized all our previous calculations needed revising we did realize that atvar said what we didnt have what we should have had was a feel forhow much revising they needed and yet kirel said in tones of wonder we may yet succeed in spite of having to abandon plans already made for a big ugly as atvar had seen time after timegenerally to his consternationabandoning plans and making new ones on the spur of the moment or even going ahead and acting without making new plans was so common as hardly to be worth noting for the race that attitude started at traumatic and got worse from there routine organization forethoughtthanks to them the empire had endured for a hundred millennia and made two other species reverence the emperor in the same way the race did adhering to routine on tosev as often as not led straight to disaster for the big uglies anticipated and exploited routine behavior but deviating from routine had dangers of its own the routine pattern was often the best one deviations just made things worse and the race wasnt good at thinking under such stress the snap decisions males came up with were usually bad decisions the big uglies exploited those too atvar removed from the screen the map of the planned campaign against deutschland in its place he substituted a detailed chart of an urban area on the lesser continental mass as you say we may yet succeed he told kirel here in chicago we have reversed the setbacks the american tosevites inflicted upon us when the weather first turned and are now moving forward once more if the trend continues the entire city may be in our hands by the end of local winter may it prove so kirel said even if we do achieve victory there the cost has proved very high we threw many males many fighting vehicles many landcruisers into that grinding machine truth atvar said sadly but once having begun the campaign to wrest control of the city from the big uglies we had to go forward with it if we abandoned it the tosevites would conclude we dared not press our attacks in the face of stiff opposition we invested more than our males in the fight for chicago we invested our prestige as well and that prestige will rise with a victory this is also truth kirel agreed once joined the battle could not be abandoned had we been able to anticipate the full cost however we might not have initiated the battle in the first place he let out a hissing sigh this has proved true in all too many instances on tosev not always though atvar said and i have a special reason for hoping the conquest of chicago will be successfully completed somewhere in the notempire called the united states skulks the ohsoredoubtable shiplord straha he laced his voice with all the scorn he could muster let the traitor see the might of the race he abandoned let him have some time to contemplate the wisdom first of revolt against me and then of treachery and when our triumph is at last complete let us bring him to justice on tosev his name shall live forever among the colonists as a symbol of betrayal the races memory was long when atvar said forever he intended to be taken literally he thought of vorgnil who had tried to murder an emperor sixtyfive thousand years before his name survived as an example of infamy strahas would stand alongside it after the conquest of tosev was complete mordechai anielewicz strode down the sidewalk as if enjoying every moment of his morning outing that the temperature was far below freezing that he wore a fur cap with earflaps down two pairs of wool trousers one inside the other a red army greatcoat and felt boots and heavy mittens that his breath smoked like a chimney and crystals froze in his beard and mustacheby the way he strolled along it might have been spring in paris not winter in lodz he was far from the only person on the street either work had to get done whether it was freezing or not people either ignored the weather or made jokes about it colder than my wife after shes talked with her mother one man said to a friend they both laughed building a young fogbank around themselves the lizards were busy on the streets of lodz too alien police looking far colder and more miserable than most humans mordechai saw labored to get traffic off the main eastwest streets they had their work cut out for them too for as fast as they shooed people away more spilled onto the boulevards they were fighting to clear not all of that was absentminded cussedness quite a few men and women were being deliberately obstructive anielewicz hoped the lizards didnt figure that out things might get ugly if they did finally the lizards cleared away enough people and wagons to get their armored column through the males peering out of the cupolas of tanks and armored personnel carriers looked even more miserable than the ones on the street they also looked absurd a lizard wearing a shaggy wolfskin cap tied on under his jaws resembled nothing so much as a dandelion gone to seed four tanks three carriers seven tanks nine carriers fifteen tanks twentyone carriers he lost track of the lorries but they were in proportion to the armored vehicles they accompanied when the parade was done he whistled softly between his teeth west of lodz the lizards had something big laid on you didnt have to be napoleon to figure out what either west of lodz lay germany still whistling he walked down to the balut market square and bought a cabbage some turnips some parsnips and a couple of chicken feet theyd make a soup that tasted meaty even if it didnt have much real meat in it next to what hed got by on in warsaw the prospect of a soup with any meat in itthe prospect of a soup with plenty of vegetables in itseemed ambrosial by comparison he wrapped his purchases in an old ragged cloth and carried them back to the fire station on lutomierska street his office was upstairs not far from the sealed room where people took refuge when the nazis threw gas at lodz if theyd known what he knew their rockets would have been flying an hour earlier he fiddled around with the draft of a letter for mordechai chaim rumkowski to present to the lizard authorities asking them to release more coal for heating having to rely on the lizards dubious mercy grated on him but every so often rumkowski did win concessions so the game was worth playing rumkowski had begged himmler for concessions too and won a few as long as he could be a big fish in the little pool of jewish lodz hed debase himself for the bigger fish in the bigger pools people wandered in and out bertha fleishmans sister had had a baby girl the night before along with everyone else anielewicz saidmazeltov even as people kept blowing one another to bits they were having babies too hed seen that in the ghetto in the midst of horror worse than any hed imagined people kept falling in love and getting married and having children he wondered if that was absolutelymeshuggeh or the sanest thing they could possibly do finally three oclock rolled around that hour corresponded to a change of shift at the telephone exchange anielewicz picked up the phone and waited for an operator to come on the other end of the line when one did he called his landlady mrs lipshitz and told her hed be working late she bore up under the news with equanimity he tried again when he heard the operators voice he asked her to put him through to rumkowskis office he asked a meaningless question about the upcoming request for more coal then hung up muttering under his breath he picked up the telephone once more when the operator answered he brightened is that you yetta he said how are you this afternoon darling saul she asked as shed been trained to do yetta wasnt her real name mordechai didnt know what it was or what she looked like the less he knew the less he could give away if he fell into the lizards hands the same listen sweetheart i need to talk to meyer the baker you know the onehis shop is right next to the balut ill try to put you through yetta said weve been having some trouble with the wires down there so it may take a while please be patient for you darling anything anielewicz said the balut was code for breslau the nearest major city in german hands had he wanted poznan hed have asked for an establishment on przelotna street telephone lines between lodz and breslau were supposed to be down in fact theywere down but here and there illicit ground lines ran between lizardheld territory and that which the germans still controlled getting through on those lines wasnt easy but people like yetta were supposed to know the tricks mordechai hoped she knew the tricks he didnt want to call breslau not so youd notice but he didnt see that he had any choice either the nazis curse them needed to know something large and ugly was heading their way one reason the lizards were relatively mild in poland was that they had the germans right next door and needed to keep the locals contented if hitler and his crew folded up the lizards would lose their incentive to behave better gevaltwhat a calculation to have to make anielewicz thought sooner than hed expected the phone on the other end of the line started ringing somebody picked it upbitte came the greeting in crisp german the connection was poor but good enough is this the shop of meyer the baker mordechai asked in yiddish and hoped the nazi on the other end was on the ball he was without missing a beat he answeredja was wilist du what do you want anielewicz knew that was thedu of insult not intimacy but held on to his temper i want to give an order ill pick up a little while from now i want you to bake me fifteen currant buns twentyone onion bagels and enough bread to go with them no i dont know how much yet not exactly ill try to call you back on that do you have it yes fifteen currant buns how much will that come to meyer youre agonif and you know it he hung up in a good display of high dudgeon a voice came from the doorway laying in supplies as a matter of fact yes nussboym mordechai answered hoping he sounded calmer than he felt i was going to bring it all in so we could celebrate berthas niece children deserve celebrating dont you think now hed have to go over to meyers and buy all that stuff david nussboym walked into mordechais room he was several years older than anielewicz and a lot of the time acted as if he thought mordechai had no business doing anything more than wiping his snotty nose now scowling he spoke in the manner of a professor to an inept student ill tell you what i think i think youre lying to me and that you were passing on code of some kind theres only one kind of code youre likely to be passing and only one set of people youre likely to be passing it to i think youve turned into hitlerstukhuslekher slowly deliberately anielewicz got to his feet he was three or four centimeters taller than nussboym and used that height advantage to look down his nose at the older man ill tell you what i think he said his voice silky with menace you gabble on abouttukhuslekhers i think you can lickmy arse nussboym stared nobody had talked to him like that since the lizards ran the germans out of lodz hed had a year and a half to get used to beingsomebody but he also had considerable native spirit and the awareness that those in authority backed him after drawing back a pace in surprise he thrust his chin forward and snapped i wouldnt talk so fine if i were you ive been doing some quiet checking mr mordechai anielewiczoh yes i know who you are some males of the race back in warsaw would be very interested in having a word or two with you i havent said anything to my friends there because i know these things can be misunderstandings and youve done good work since you got here but if youre going to bring the nazis back into poland god forbid mordechai broke in with complete sincerity but i dont want the lizards in germany either and you cant understand that side of the coin i want hitler dead i want himmler dead i want hans frank dead i want every nazi bastard with ss on his collar tabs dead nussboym said his face working that wouldnt begin to be payment enough for what they did to us id sooner kill them all myself but if i have to let the race do it for me ill settle for that and then what happens anielewicz demanded i dont care what happens then david nussboym answered thats plenty all by itself but its not dont you see mordechai said something like desperation in his voice after that who stops the lizards from doing exactly as they please if you know who i am you know ive worked with them too they dont make any bones about it they intend to rule mankind forever when they say forever they dont mean a thousand years like that madman hitler they mean forever and they arent madmen if they win now we wont get a second chance better them than the germans nussboym said stubbornly but you see david the choice isnt that simple we have to without changing expression without breaking off his flow of words amelewicz hit nussboym in the belly as hard as he could hed intended to hit him in the pit of the stomach and win the fight at the first blowblitzkrieg fashion but his fist landed a few centimeters to one side of where he wanted to put it nussboym grunted in pain but instead of folding up like a concertina he grappled with mordechai they fell together knocking over with a crash the chair on which anielewicz had been sitting mordechai had done a lot of fighting with a rifle in his hand it was a different business altogether when the fellow you were trying to beat wasnt a tiny spot seen through your sights but was at the same time doing his best to choke the life out of you nussboym was stronger and tougher than hed figured too again he realized being on the opposite side didnt turn you into a sniveling coward nussboym tried to knee him in the groin he twisted aside and took the knee on the hip he would have thought it even less sporting had he not tried to do the same thing to nussboym a moment earlier they rolled up against mordechais desk it was a cheap light flimsy thing made of pine and plywood mordechai tried to bang nussboyms head against the side of it nussboym threw up an arm just in time a heavy glass ashtray fell off the desk anielewicz was damned if he knew why hed kept the thing around he didnt smoke even if he had smoked nobody in poland had any tobacco these days anyhow but the ashtray had been on his desk when he got the office and he hadnt bothered getting rid of it it came in handy now he and david nussboym both grabbed for it at the same time but nussboym couldnt reach it mordechais arm was longer he seized it and hit nussboym in the head nussboym groaned but kept fighting so mordechai hit him again after the third blow nussboyms eyes rolled up and he went limp anielewicz struggled to his feet his clothes were torn he had a bloody nose and he felt as if hed just crawled out of a cement mixer people crowded in the doorway staring he was going to tell the lizards who i am mordechai said his voice came out raw and rasping nussboym had come closer to strangling him than hed thought bertha fleishman nodded briskly i was afraid that would happen do you think we have to shut him up for good i dont want to mordechai answered i dont want any more jews dead hes not a bad man hes just wrong here can we get him out of the way for good she nodded again hell have to go east but well manage i have enough communist friends to be sure hell get into russia without ever having the chance to speak his piece to the lizards whatll happen to him there anielewicz asked theyre liable to ship him to siberia hed meant it for a joke but berthas sober nod said it was indeed a possibility mordechai shrugged if thats how it is then thats how it is hell have a chance to stay alive there and wed have to kill him here lets get him out of here for now bertha said more quietly she added you ought to think about disappearing too mordechai not everyone who favors the lizards is as open as nussboym you could be betrayed any time he bit his lip she was right he knew she was right but the idea of going on the road again finding another alias and joining a partisan band pierced him with a chill worse than any winters gale goodbye lodz goodbye flat he muttered as he took hold of david nussboyms feet heinrich jager felt like a tabletennis ball whenever he returned from a mission he never knew where he would bounce up next to schloss hohentubingen to help the men with the thick glasses and the high foreheads drive the explosivemetal bomb project forward off on another run with otto skorzeny to tweak the lizards snouts or to lead panzers into battle something he actually knew how to do after he got back from albi theyd stuck him in a panzer again that was where the powers that be stuck him when the war was going badly if the lizards overran thevaterland everything else became irrelevant he stood up in the cupola of his panther the wind tore at him even through his reversible parka he wore it white side out now to go with the panzers whitewashed turret and hull the machine large and white and deadly reminded him of a polar bear as it rumbed east from breslau as for the parka it kept him from freezing next to the makeshifts thewehrmacht had used two winters before in russia it was a miracle with it on he was just cold that seemed pretty good he knew all about freezing his gunner a moonfaced corporal named gunther grillparzer said any sign of the lizards yet sir no jager answered ducking back down inside the turret to talk i tell you the truth im just as glad not seeing them ach jagrillparzer said i just hope that call from the damned jews wasnt a pack of damned moonshine for all we know the bastards want to make us motor around and burn up petrol for no reason they wouldnt do thati hope they wouldnt do that jager added to himself after what thereich had done to the jews in poland how could he blame them if they wanted revenge aloud he went on the commandant seems convinced the call was legitimate ja herr oberstgrillparzer said but those arent angels that come out the commandants arse when he squats on the wc are they jager stood up again without answering russians and lizardsand sseinsatzgruppe menfollowed orders without thinking about them thewehrmacht trained its soldiers to show initiative in everything they didand if that made them less respectful of their superiors than they would have been otherwise well you had to take the bad with the good they reached the crest of a low rise halt jager told the driver and then relayed the command to the rest of the panzers in the battle group anad hoc formation that essentially meantall the armored vehicles we can scrape together for the moment well deploy along this line hull down everyone when a polar bear prowled through ice and snow it was the most deadly predator in its domain foxes and badgers and wolverines stepped aside seals and reindeer fled for their lives jager wishedoh how he wished the same held true for his panther and for the panthers and panzer ivs and tigers with it unfortunately however in straightup combat it took anywhere from five to a couple of dozen german panzers to knock out one lizard machine that was why he had no intention of meeting the lizards in straightup combat if he could possibly help it strike from ambush fall back hit the lizards again when they stormed forward to overwhelm the position youd just evacuated fall back againthat was how you hurt them he wished for a cigarette or a cigar or a pipe or a dip of snuff hed never tasted snuff in his life he just wanted tobacco there were stories that people had killed themselves when they couldnt get anything to smoke he didnt know if he believed those or not but he felt the lack he had a little flask of schnapps he took a nip now it snarled its way down his gullet it might have been aged half an hour before somebody poured it into a bottle then again it might not have after he drank he felt warmer the doctors said that was nonsenseto hell with the doctors he thought what was that off in the distance he squinted through swirling snow no it wasnt a horsedrawn wagon too big and too quick and there came another behind it and another his stomach knotted around the schnapps lizard panzers heading this way down into the turret again he spoke two brief sentences one to the gunnerthe jews werent lyingand one to the loaderarmorpiercing he added one more sentence over the wireless for the benefit of the battle group hold fire to within five hundred meters he stuck head and shoulders out into the cold again raising binoculars to his eyes for a better look not just lizard panzers coming this way but their personnel carriers too that was good news and bad news the panzers could smash them but if they disgorged their infantry before they were hit they were very bad news lizard foot soldiers carried antipanzer rockets that madepanzerschrecks look like cheap toys by comparison the panzer troops he commanded had plenty of fire disciplinedanken gott dafur theyd wait as he had ordered let the lizards get close and then hit them hard before dropping back to the next ridge line theyd maybe the crew of the tiger a few hundred meters away hadnt been paying attention to the wireless maybe their set was broken or maybe they just didnt give a damn about fire discipline the longbarreled roared with the leaders of the lizard force still a kilometer and a half away dumbheaded pigdog jager screamed the tiger scored a clean hit one of the personnel carriers stopped dead smoke spurting from it through the dying reverberations of the cannon shot jager heard the crew of the tiger yelling like drunken idiots the resemblance didnt end there either he thought bitterly he ducked into the turret once more before he could speak gunther grillparzer said it for him the lizards know were here jajager slapped the gunner on the shoulder good luck well need it he spoke to the driver over the intercom listen for my orders johannes we may have to get out of here in a hurry jawohl herr oberst they were agood crew probably not quite so fine as the one hed had in franceklaus meinecke had been a genius with a cannonbut damn good he wondered how much that was going to help them exactly what hed feared was happening instead of motoring blithely down the highway toward breslau and presenting their flanks for closerange killing shots the lizard panzers were turning to face his position straight on neither a tigers main armament nor a panthers could penetrate their glacis plates and turrets at pointblank range let alone at fifteen hundred meters and the personnel carriers were pulling back even farther he got on the allpanzers circuit they know were here now panzer ivs concentrate on the carriersgott mit uns well come out of this all rightor some of us will anyhow he glossed mentally some of them wouldnt the panzer ivs along the line of the ridge opened up not only with armorpiercing shells to wreck the personnel carriers but also with highexplosive rounds to deal with the lizards whod left before being hit the order was coldblooded calculation on jagers part the ivs had the weakest cannons and the weakest armor of the machines in the battle group not only were they best suited for handling the carriers they were also the panzers jager could best afford to lose when the lizards started shooting back hed hoped the lizard panzers would come charging up the slope toward his position cannon blazing the russians had made that mistake time and again and the lizards more than once that kind of rush would give his panther and tiger crews closerange shots and shots at the lizards side armor which their cannon could penetrate the lizards were learning though their panzer crews had been through combat too and had a notion of what worked they didnt need to charge they could engage at long range even at fifteen hundred meters a hit from one of their monster shells would blowdid blowthe turret right off a panzer iv and send it blazing into the snow jager clenched his fists with luck the commander gunner and loader there never knew what hit them nor were the armored personnel carriers helpless against panzers their light cannon wouldnt penetrate turret armor but some of them carried rockets on launch rails on the sides of their turrets like the ones the lizard infantry used those had no trouble cracking a panzer retreat jager bawled on the allhands frequency make them come to us the maybach in the panther he personally commanded bellowed louder as it stopped idling and went into reverse thisll be interesting grillparzer shouted up at jager will we be in our new position before they get up here where we are now and start blasting away at us interestingwasnt the word jager would have used but it would do the trouble was the lizard panzers were not only better armed and armored than the ones thewehrmacht had they were faster too general guderian hadnt been joking when he said a panzers engine was as important a weapon as its gun a tiger maybe half a kilometer off to the north of jager took a hit just as it was about to reach the cover of pine woods it brewed up spectacularly with a smoke ring going out through the cupola as if the devil were enjoying a cigar and then with the ammunition cooking off in a display of orange and red fireworks some of the smoke that boiled out of it came from the burning flesh of its five crewmen grillparzer got a decent shot at one of the lizard panzers but its armor held the round out of the fighting compartment a trail of fire appeared from out of a snowdrift with no lizard panzers nearby the lizard infantry had come up the rocket hit a panzer iv in the engine compartment which burst into flames hatches popped open men ran for the trees a couple of them made it machinegun fire cut down the rest voices were screaming in jagers earphones theyre flanking usherr oberst two enemy panzers have broken through if they get in our rear were done for can you call for reinforcements sir if you were commanding a battle group you didnt have much hope of calling for reinforcements battle groups got formed from the scrapings at the bottom of the barrel jagers men were rightif the lizards got behind them they were in big trouble that made the requisite order easy no matter how distasteful it was retreat jager said on the allpanzers circuit well fall back to the first line of defenses around breslau three belts of fortifications ringed the city on the oder if they were penetrated breslau itself could hold for a long time perhaps even in the way chicago was holding in the united states though jager had distant relatives on the other side of the atlantic nothing hed seen in the first world war or heard in this one till the lizards came left him thinking much of americans as soldiers chicago made him wonder if hed been wrong but chicago was far away breslau was close and getting closer all the time as the driver retreated westward the town had lots of bridges if you managed to blow them all jager thought the lizards would have a rough time crossing the oder when that occurred to him he realized he didnt really believe thewehrmacht could make a stand at breslau but if they couldnt hold the lizards there where could they so you see general groves jens larssen began before he could go on groves was glaring at him again like a fat old bulldog getting ready to growl at a stranger across the street what i see professor is somebody who wont listen when i tell him no he said we arent packing up and moving to hanford and thats all there is to it im sick of your whining soldier shut up and soldier do you understand me oh i understand you all right you larssen clamped his jaw down hard on the scarlet rage that welled up in his mindyou goddamn pigheaded son of a bitch he got more creative from there hed never seen an atomic bomb go off but the explosion inside his head felt like one they arent paying you to love me groves said theyre paying you to do what i tell you get on back to work the boss of the metallurgical laboratory crew held up a hand no take the rest of the day off go back to your quarters and think it over come tomorrow morning i expect you to throw everything you have into this project you got it ive got it jens said through clenched teeth he left the office and went downstairs hed leaned the springfield he always carried against the wall down there now he slung it back over his shoulder oscar the guard said you dont really need to tote that thing sir not like youre in the army his companion a jugeared yahoo named pete laughed his big pointy adams apple bobbed up and down jens didnt answer he went out to the row of parked bicycles lifted the kickstand to his with the side of his shoe and started to head off north on the road back to lowry field as groves had ordered oscars voice pursued him where are you going sir the piles are that way he pointed down toward the athletic field the piles are on your miserable snooping asswith no tone at all in his voice larssen said general groves wants me to take the day off and think about things in my quarters so im not going back to the piles oh okay but instead of letting it go at that oscar spoke quietly to pete for a moment then said i guess ill come with you then sir make sure you get there all right make sure you do what youre toldoscar didnt trust him nobody here trusted him between the met lab and colonel hexham theyd all got together to screw up his life eight ways from sunday and now they didnt trust him wasnt that a hell of a thing do whatever you damn well please larssen said and started pedaling sure as shit oscar climbed aboard his own bicycle and rolled after him up university boulevard to alameda then east on alameda to the air base and the delightful confines of boq jens didnt think much of the place as somewhere to do any serious contemplating but hed take the day off and see what sprang from it maybe hed be able to look at things differently afterwards the day was cold but clear jens long winter shadow raced along beside him undulating over snowdrifts by the side of the road oscars lumpier shadow stayed right with it just as oscar clung to jens like a leech for a long while they had the road to themselves oscar knew better than to try any casual conversation larssen despised him quite enough when he was keeping his mouth shut about halfway between the turn onto alameda and the entrance to lowry field they met another bicycle rider coming west the fellow wasnt making any great speed just tooling along as if out for a constitutional jens jaw tightened when he recognized colonel hexham hexham unfortunately recognized him too yoularssenhalt he called stopping himself what are you doing away from your assigned post jens thought about ignoring the officious bastard but figured oscar wouldnt let him get away with it he stopped maybe ten feet in front of hexham oscar positioned himself between the two of them oscar was a bastard but not a dumb bastard he knew how jens felt about colonel hexham what are you doing away from your post hexham repeated his voice had a yapping quality as if he were part lapdog his face as always was set in disapproving lines he had pouchy suspicious eyes and a shriveled prune of a mouth with a thin smudge of black mustache above it his hair was shiny and slick with wildroot or some other kind of grease he must have had his own private hoard of the stuff jens said general groves ordered me to take a day off go back to my quarters and just relax for a bit then get back to it with a new attitudefat chance if i have to deal with a slug like you is that so by the mockery hexham packed into the question he didnt believe a word of it he wasnt any fonder of jens than jens was of him turning to oscar he said sergeant is what this man tells me true sir its exactly the same thing he told me oscar replied hexham clapped a dramatic hand to his forehead a gesture he must have stolen from a bad movie my god and you didnt check it with general groves yourself uh no sir oscars voice suddenly went toneless he might have been trying to deny he was there while standing in plain sight a trick larssen had seen enlisted men use before well get to the bottom of this colonel hexham snapped well all go back to the university of denver and find out just precisely whatif anythinggeneral groves told professor larssen to do come on he made as if to start riding again uh sir oscar began and then shut up a sergeant had no way to tell a colonel he was being a damn fool come on hexham growled again this time staring straight at jens well get to the bottom of this malingering damn me to hell if we dont get moving jens got moving at first he seemed to be watching himself from outside he unslung the springfield flipping off the safety as he did so he always carried a round in the chamber but as the rifle came up to his shoulder he was back inside his own head calculating as abstractly as if he were working on a problem of atomic decay tactics oscar was the more dangerous foenot only was he closer to jens he was a real fighting man not a pouter pigeon in a uniform jens shot him in the face oscar never knew what hit him he flew off the bike saddle the back of his head exploding in red ruin jens worked the bolt the expended cartridge jingled cheerily when it hit the asphalt colonel hexhams eyes and mouth were open as wide as they could be goodbye colonel jens said sweetly and shot him in the head too the clank of the second cartridge on the roadway brought jens back to himself he felt exalted as if hed just got laid he even had a hardon but two bodies sprawled in spreading pools of blood would take some explaining he couldnt give no matter how much both the stinking bastards had it coming cant go back to boq not now nosiree jens said he often talked to himself when he was alone on the road and he sure as hell was alone now hed made certaindead certainof that couldnt go to boq couldnt go back to the pile either okay what did that leave for a second he didnt think it left anything but that was just a last bit of reluctance to face what had been in the back of his mind for a long time humanity didnt have any use for him any more people had been rubbing his nose in that ever since barbara let him know shed been spreading her legs for the lousy ballplayer shed found they didnt need him in denver they wouldnt listen to his plans theyd gone ahead and built a bombbuilt a couple of bombswithout him well to hell with humanity then the lizards would care to hear what he had to tell them yes sir they sure would dim memories of thornton burgess stories floated up in his mind from childhood theyd know how to reward him properly for telling them too but he wouldnt be doing it for the reward oh no getting his own back was a lot more important he carefully put the safety back on slung the springfield over his shoulder and headed east the sentries at the entrance of lowry field just nodded to him as he rolled past they hadnt heard the rifle shots hed worried a little about that a map unrolled in his mind theyd find the bodies theyd chase him if they understood he was heading east toward the lizards theyd probably figure hed go east on us that was the straight route the route a crazy man who wasnt hitting on all cylinders would take but he wasnt crazy not even slightly not him he had us and us north of us and us and us south of it plus all the little back roads between the highways before long hed pick one somewhere not far from the coloradokansas border hed find the lizards he bent his back and pedaled harder it was all downhill from here yes sir mutt daniels said the way he said it told what he thought of the order cautiously he added we been doin a lot of retreating lately aint we sir so we have captain szymanski also looked sour about it seeing that mutt pushed a little harder seems like we aint needed to do most of it neither not from the way the fightin went beforehand and this latest this here is just a skedaddle nothin else but sir his company commander shrugged as if to say he couldnt do anything about it no matter what he thought major renfree and i have been screaming to the colonel and hes been screaming to the high command theres nothing he can do to get the orders changed from what he says they came right from the top from general marshall himself you want to call up fdr lieutenant it would take somethin like that wouldnt it daniels sighed okay sir i dont know what the hells going on ill just shut my damnfool mouth and do like im told anybodyd think i was in the army or some damn thing like that szymanski laughed im glad you are in the army mutt you keep everybody around you all nice and looseygoosey imnot glad im in the army meanin no offense to you sir mutt said i done my bit in the last war only reason they need old farts like me is on account of the lizards wasnt for them bastards id be lookin ahead to spring training not tryin to figure out how to pull my men back without lookin too much like im doin it weve got to do it captain szymanski answered i dont know why but we do and if thats not the army for you what the devil is yes sir if mutt laid down the bunt sign the fellow at the plate had to try and bunt whether he liked mutts strategy or not now it was his turn to do something he really hated because the higherups thought it was a smart movethey better be right he thought as he climbed to his feet sergeant muldoon looked anything but happy when he brought the news from on high jeez lieutenant theyre sandbaggin so hard they could build a wall around these damn lizards with all the sand he said we should be kickin their ass instead o letting them push us around you know it i know it the captain knows it the colonel knows it but general marshall he dont know it and he counts for moren the rest of us put together daniels answered i just wish i was sure he had some kind of notion of what he was up to thats all whats that they say about ours is not to wonder why the other part of it goes something like ours is to let the bastards kill us even when they dont have a clue herman muldoon said he was cynical enough to make a sergeant all right and like any decent sergeant he knew fighting city hall didnt pay okay lieutenant how we gonna make this work mutt let stories from his grandfathers give him the clues he needed to do the job right he thinned his main line down to what either granddad would have called a line of skirmishers then to nothing but pickets to disguise that as best he could he made sure the pickets had automatic weapons and both the bazooka launchers in the platoon to try to hold back lizard armor the brass also had a lot of tanks and antitank guns well forward mutt didnt quite follow that it was as if they wanted the lizards to go forward all right but not too far or too fast he hoped the big picture made sense because the little one sure as hell didnt his men had the same feeling retreat was hard on an army you felt as if you were beaten regardless of whether you really were the troops didnt look ready to bug out but they didnt act like men with their peckers up either if they had to fight and hold ground he wasnt sure they could do it not that much of chicago looked like ground worth holding anyhow as far as that went one stretch of rubble was pretty much like another even tanks had a rough time making their way through piles of brick and stone and craters big enough to swallow them whole he was taken by surprise when he came upon one stretch of halfway decent road as his unit trudged north you can go that way if you want to an mp doing traffic control said but it makes you easier for the lizards to spot from the air then what the hell did anybody build it for mutt asked the mp didnt answer odds were the mp couldnt answer because he didnt know maybe nobody knew maybe the army had cleared the road just so people walking along it could get killed in carload lots mutt was past the stage where anything had to make sense not far from the southern end of the road he watched a team of soldiers busily repairing a house they werent repairing it to look like new they were repairing it to look like the wreckage all around it it looked as if theyd knocked down the whole side nearest the road inside was a wooden crate big enough to make a pretty good hooverville shack in a little while though you wouldnt be able to see it because the soldiers would have restored the wall theyd knocked down by the time they were done the place would look as ugly as it had before they started aint that a hell of a thing muldoon jerked his thumb at the soldiers are we fighting the lizards or are we building houses for em dont ask me daniels answered i gave up a long time ago tryin to figure out whats goin on they aint gonna stay there and try and hold on to that box are they muldoon asked the question wasnt aimed particularly at mutt who didnt have any answers but at whoever in the world might know muldoon spat in the mud sometimes i think everybodys gone crazy but me you know he gave daniels a sidelong look me and maybe you too lieutenant it aint like its your fault from muldoon that was a compliment and mutt knew it he thought about what the sergeant had said he also thought about the way the brass was running the fight here in chicago if theyd just kept at what they were doing they could have pushed the lizards back to the south side maybe even out of chicago altogether oh yeah it would have cost but mutt had been through the trenches in the first world war he knew you had to pay the price if you wanted to gain ground but instead they were pulling back mutt turned to muldoon youre right they must be crazy its the only thing that makes any sense atall solemnly muldoon nodded heinrich jager slammed his fist down on the cupola as his panther rumbled out of oels heading west toward breslau he was wearing gloves otherwise his skin would have peeled off when it hit the frozen metal of the panzer he wasnt crazyno not he about his superiors he had considerable doubts so did gunther grillparzer the gunner said sir what the devils the point of pulling out of oels now after weve spent the last three days fighting over it as if it were breslau itself if i knew i would tell you jager answered it doesnt make any sense to me either not only had thewehrmacht done a good job of fortifying oels as part of the outer ring of breslaus defensive system the fourteenthcentury castle up on the hill made a firstclass artillery observation post and now they were abandoning the town the castle or what was left of it and the works the engineers had made just letting the lizards take them while the panzers pulled back closer to breslau artillery shells whistled overhead plowing up the frozen ground between the retreating panzers and oels as if to tell the lizardsthus far and no farther jager wondered if the lizards would listen they were hitting hard in this latest onslaught probably fighting better than they had since the days when they first came to earth and swept everything before them his panther had two narrow rings and one wide one painted on the cannon just behind the muzzle brake two armored personnel carriers and one panzer the lizards were still tactically sloppy they didnt watch their flanks as well as they should and they walked into ambushes even russians would have seen half the time though they fought their way out of the ambushes too not because they were great soldiers but because their panzers and rockets broke the trap from the inside out as always theyd inflicted far more damage than they suffered even now lizard artillery shells fell around the panzers as they withdrew jager feared them almost as much as he feared the lizards panzers they spat little mines all over the bloody place if your panzer ran over one of those it would blow a track right off and maybe send you up in flames sure enough his panther passed two disabled panzer ivs their crews glumly trudging west on foot he gnawed on his lower lip oels was only about fifteen kilometers east of breslau the lizards were already shelling the city that sprawled across the oder if they established artillery in oels they could pound breslau to pieces scattering about so many of their little mines that no one would dare walk the streets let alone drive armored vehicles through them and yet hed been ordered to give up a position he could have held for a long timeordered in terms so peremptory that he knew protest would have been useless standfast orders were what hed come to expect even when standing fast cost more lives than retreating would have now when standing fast made sense he had to give ground if that wasnt insanity what was it his discontent deepened when his panzer finally reached its new assigned position the village just outside of breslau that was the linchpin of the new german line might have held fifty people before the war it was on flat ground and as far as he could see had no special reason for existing some rolls of barbed wire strung across the landscape and a few trenches for infantrymen didnt constitute a line of defense as far as he was concerned no matter how imposing the wire and trenches might seem on a map in a warm room out of the range of the guns his driver thought the same thing sir they made us pull back tothis he said in incredulous dismay johannes believe you me i wouldnt have given you the order on my own jager answered somebody had at least some small sense of how to defend a position a soldier in a white parka over black panzer coveralls directed the panther to a barn with a doorway that pointed east a good firing position if the lizards broke out of oels and stormed toward breslau a couple of hundred meters farther west lay a stone farmhouse behind which he could retreat after firing and which would do for a second position but if the lizards broke out of oels nothing here at least was going to stop them from breaking into breslau to give the artillery its due it was trying to make sure the lizards didnt break out of oels just west of the town the ground jerked and quivered and shook like a live thing every gun the germans had around breslau must have been pounding that stretch of terrain jager hadnt seen such a bombardment since his days in the trenches in world war i he didnt see any shells fallingin oels though thewehrmacht had conceded the town to the lizards and for the life of him he didnt understand why they could consolidate there at their leisure for the next big push they were taking advantage of everything the germans gave them too through field glasses he watched panzers and lorries coming into oels and gathering east of the town what the hells going on gunther grillparzer demanded out and out anger in his voice why arent we throwing gas into oels the winds blowing in the right directionstraight out of the west weve got a wonderful target there and were ignoring it ive seen the high muckymucks do some really stupid things but this takes the cake jager should have pounced on that open profession of heresy but he didnt he couldnt he felt the same way himself he peered through the field glasses for another thirty seconds or so then lowered them with a grunt of disgust hed risked his neck to throw nerve gas at the gasmask factory in albi why the devil wasnt the artillery heaving it toward the lizards now tear me off a chunk of that bread will you gunther he said when the gunner handed him a piece of the brown loaf he dug out a tinfoil tube of meat paste and squeezed a blob onto the bread just because your commanders belonged in an institution for the feebleminded was no reason to starve die yes starve no he was looking down at the bread and meat when the gloomy interior of the barn suddenly filled with a light as bright asbrighter thanday johannes the driver let out a cry in his earphones my eyes jager looked up just for an instant then lowered his gaze once more like the sun the fireball in what had been oels was too brilliant to look at the light that filled the barn went from white to yellow to orange to red slowly fading as it did so when jager looked up again he saw a great fiery pillar ascending toward the heavens coloring the clouds red as blood the ground shook under the treads of the panther a wind tore briefly at the barn doors then subsided stuck inside the turret grillparzer demanded what the fuck was that i dont know jager said and then a moment later my god he knew what an explosivemetal bomb had done to berlin hed heard about what had happened to washington and tokyo and south of moscow but knowing what such a bomb could do and seeing the bomb do itthe difference between those two was like the difference between reading a love poem and losing your virginity they really did it he breathed in amazement who really did what sir the panzer gunner asked indignantly the physicists atoh never mind where gunther jager answered even in the midst of such awe as hed not felt in church for years he did not forget his worship of the great god security the point is weve just given the lizards what they gave berlin the panzer crew shouted like men possessed jager joined the exultation but more quietly that sense of awe still filled him some of the explosive metal was what hed snatched prometheuslike from the lizards it was seldom given to a colonel of panzers to feel hed personally turned the course of history jager had that feeling now in an odd way it seemed larger than he was he shook himself bringing the real world back into focus johannes how are your eyes he asked over the intercom ill be all right sir i think the driver answered it was like the worlds biggest flashbulb went off a centimeter in front of my nose i still see a big ring of smeary color but its getting smaller and dimmer thats good jager said think of it like this for the lizards over there in oels its as if the sun went off a centimeter in front of their snoutsand theyll never see anything again more cheers rang out gunther grillparzer said you know what sir i have to apologize to the muckymucks never thought id live to see the day i tell you what corporal jager said i wont tell them that way they wont die of shock the gunner laughed loud and long jager added i thought theyd gone round the bend myself and im not ashamed to say so but it makes sense now they let the lizards concentrate in oels didnt shell the town itself both to hold the lizards there and to make sure the bomb didnt get hit by accident and then yes sir grillparzer agreed enthusiastically and then in color and shape the cloud rising from the explosivemetal bomb put jager in mind of caesars amanita it was more nearly the hue of apricot flesh than the rich bright orange of the mushroom prized for its flavor since roman days but that was a detail he wondered how many kilometers into the sky the cap of the mushroom rose well he said half to himself i think breslau has held gunther grillparzer heard himjawohl the gunner said an alarm hissed insistently atvar thrashed and twisted in free fall fighting to stay asleep before long he knew the fight was lost as consciousness returned fear came with it you didnt wake the fleetlord to report good news one of his eye turrets swiveled toward the communications screen sure enough pshings face stared out of it the adjutants mouth worked but no sound emerged he looked extraordinarily ugly that way or perhaps atvar was grumpy at being roused so suddenly activate twoway voice he told the computer in his rest chamber and then addressed pshing here i am whats the commotion exalted fleetlord pshing cried the big ugliesthe deutsch big ugliesset off a fission bomb as we were about to overrun their fortified position at the town called breslau we had been concentrating males and equipment in the forward area for the assault on their works immediately outside the city and suffered large losses in the blast atvar bared his teeth in a grimace of anguish a tosevite who knew a little about the race might have taken for laughter his plan for the attack on deutschland had allowed for the deutsch big uglies having better weapons than the race knew them to possess but had not anticipated their having atomic bombs tensely he asked is this a case like that of the sssr where theyve shaped a device from plutonium they stole from us exalted fleetlord results of analysis are at present both preliminary and ambiguous pshing answered first approximation is that some of the fissile material was indeed taken from us but that some may well have been independently produced atvar grimaced again if that report was accurate it was what hed dreaded most the sssr had used the one bomb apparently of plutonium stolen from the race but had shown no signs of being able to produce its own that was bad but could be lived with if the deutsche knew not only how to exploit radioactives that fell into their hands but also how to produce those radioactives the war against the big uglies had just taken a new and altogether revolting turn what are your orders exalted fleetlord pshing asked shall we bomb the deutsch positions in breslau and avenge ourselves in that fashion do you mean with our own nuclear weapons atvar said when his adjutant made the affirmative gesture he went on no what would be the point of that it would only create more nuclear zones for our males to cross and the fallout given tosev weather patterns would adversely affect forces farther east unfortunately we have not succeeded in tracking down the area where the deutsche are conducting their nuclear experiments that is not surprising pshing answered they so contaminated a stretch of their own territory when a pile went out of control that the radioactivity in the area could mask a successful experiment on their part truth atvar said bitterly even their incompetence may work in their favor and after the lesson we taught the nipponese they must know we respond severely to nuclear development efforts on the part of big uglies they will be shielding their program as well as they can surely you will not leave them unpunished merely because we cannot locate their nuclear reactors pshing exclaimed oh by no means atvar said if he did nothing the revolt straha had led against him would be merely a small annoyance when compared to what the shiplords and officers would do to him now unless he wanted kirel holding his position he had to respond have the targeting specialist select a deutsch city within the zone of radioactive contamination we shall remind the big uglies we are not to be trifled with report the targeting choice to me as soon as it is madeand it had best be made soon it shall be done pshings face vanished from the screen atvar tried to go back to sleep that would have been the perfect way to show this latest setback did not unduly concern him the setbackdid concern him though and sleep proved as elusive as victory over the big ugliesso much for enhancing my reputation among the males he thought he laughed in selfmockery by the time this war was done if it ever was hed be lucky to have any reputation left the communicator screen lit up again the largest deutsch city within the contaminated zone is the one called munchen exalted fleetlord pshing reported a map showed atvar where in deutschland munchen lay it is also a major manufacturing center and transport hub atvar studied the railroad and highway networks surrounding the city very well he said let munchen be destroyed and let it be a lesson to the deutsche and to all the big uglies of tosev it shall be done pshing said thegoyim had a legend of the wandering jew with a knapsack on his back and a german rifle slung over his shoulder mordechai anielewicz felt hed done enough wandering to live up to the legend there werent as many woods and forests around lodz as there were farther east fewer places for partisan bands to take refuge against the wrath of the lizards he hadnt been able to find a band to join not yet lizards had rolled past him a few times in their armored vehicles theyd paid him no special heed armed men were common on polish roads and some of them fought for not against the aliens besides the lizards were heading west toward the battle with the nazis even from many kilometers away anielewicz had listened to the sullen mutter of artillery the sound hung in the air like distant thunder on a summers day he tried to gauge the progress of the battle by whether the rumble grew louder or softer but knew he was just guessing atmospherics had as much to do with how the artillery duel sounded as did advances and retreats he was walking toward a farmhouse in the hope of working for his supper when the western horizon lit up had the sun poked through the clouds that blanketed the sky nothe glow seemed to be coming fromin front of the clouds he stared in awe at the great glowing mushroom cloud that rose into the sky like heinrich jager he quickly realized what it had to be unlike jager he did not know which side had touched it off if it was germans he too knew he played a role and no small one in their getting at least some of the explosive metal theyd needed if itis the nazis do i get credit for that or blame he asked aloud again unlike jager he found no sure answer teerts checked the radar in his headup display no sign of deutsch aircraft anywhere nearby the thought had hardly crossed his mind before sserep one of his wingmales said its going to be easy today superior sir thats what nivvek thought and look what happened to him teerts answered the race hadnt been able to rescue the other male before the deutsche captured him from some reports the deutsche treated prisoners better than the nipponese did for nivveks sake teerts hoped those reports were true he still had nightmares about his own captivity he suspected more nightmares were heading his way he wishedhow he wished elifrim had chosen a different male to lead the protection for the punishment killercraft now flying toward munchen had the deutsche known the load that killercraft carried they would have sent up everything that would fly in an effort to knock it down theyd used an atomic bomb against the race and they were going to be reminded they could not do that without paying the price tokyo had already paid that price thanks to teerts and the nipponese hadnt even had nuclear weaponsthey were just trying to acquire them they were only big uglies but teerts felt guilty anyhow and now he was going to have to watch a tosevite city go up in atomic flame the pilot of the punishment killercraft a male named jisrin had no such qualms mechanical as if he were a computer himself he said target is visually obscured i shall carry out the bombing run by radar acknowledged teerts said he spoke to sserep and his other wingmale a relatively inexperienced flier named hossad well want to swing wide of the punishment killercraft after it releases its bomb from everything ive heard and reviewed in the training scenarios blast effects and winds can do dreadful things to aircraft handling if were too close to the site of the explosion youll follow my lead it shall be done sserep and hossad said together in his flightleaders circuit teerts listened to his opposite number on the other side of the punishment killercraft giving his wingmales almost identical instructions then jisrin said i am releasing the weapon on the mark mark ignition will delay until proper altimeter reading meanwhile i suggest we depart he hit his afterburner and streaked away from the doomed city teerts swung his killercraft through a wide turn that would bring him back on course for the air base in southern france his wingmales followed up till now everything had run as smoothly as if it were a training mission that relieved himsuch things didnt happen very often on tosev and alarmed him too what would go wrong now nothing not this time a great ball of fire burned through the clouds below and behind him flinging them aside scattering them vaporizing them the glare was terrifying overwhelming teerts nictitating membranes flicked across his eyes to protect them as if the piercing light were a grain of sand or grit that could be physically pushed aside moments later the blast wave caught up with the fleeing killercraft and flicked it through the air it was stronger and sharper than teerts had expected the airframe groaned under the sudden strain but held together teerts and the killercrafts computer rewon control by the emperor hossad said softly as he too mastered his killercraft we take for granted what the atom can do it gives us electric power it electrolyzes hydrogen and oxygen for our vehicles it powers our ships between the stars but when you let it loose he didnt go on he didnt need to go on teerts wished he had a taste of ginger jisrin still matteroffact put the capper on the mission the target is destroyed returning to base atvar listened to the bestial howls of rage that came over the crackling shortwave frequencies from deutschland one thing the atomic bomb that had smote munchen had not done it had not got rid of hitler the notemperor of the deutsche even without understanding a single word of the deutsch language atvar also gathered that it had not persuaded hitler to yield he turned away from the incomprehensible rantings of the deutsch notemperor to a translation we shall have vengeance hitler was saying the translator added an emphatic cough to show the stress the big ugly put on the words our strength lies not in defense but in attack mankind has grown strong in eternal struggles we shall once more make the heroic decision to resist our ideaour peopleis right and so is invincible every persecution will lead to our inner strengthening this war is one of the elemental conflicts which will usher in a new world era at its end deutschland will either be a world power or will not be at all if the deutsch people despair now they will deserve no better than they get if they despair i will not be sorry for them if god lets them down the translator added speaking in my own voice for a moment i should note that all of these not particularly rational utterances are accompanied by vehement and prolonged applause from the big uglies in the audience rational or not hitler has a strong hold on the tosevites of his notempire when he resumed the febrile tone he assumed showed he was once more passing on hitlers words we shall have vengeance i say again for every bomb the lizards use against us we shall use six eight ten a hundred bombs against them we shall destroy them so completely it shall be as if they never were they have dared test themselves against the master race and they shall fail the translator added another emphatic cough then said this preposterous and vain pronouncement was greeted with more applause atvar turned off the tosevites speech well what do you think of that he asked kirel destroying munchen has failed to intimidate the deutsche kirel answered i find this most unfortunate unfortunate yes atvar said with an emphatic cough of his own kirels restrained pattern of speech could sometimes be most effective atvar went on what do you make of this hitlers threat to respond bomb against bomb my opinion exalted fleetlord is that he will do so if he has the ability kirel said and since analysis confirms that this latest bomb was made partly from nuclear material not stolen from us his voice trailed away he either does have the ability or will have it soon atvar finished unhappily that is my conclusion also my other conclusion is that this war has just grown a great deal worse spirits of departed emperors willing i shall not have to say that so often in future mutt daniels opened his canteen and poured from it into his cup the liquid that went from one to the other was a deep amber color he lifted the cup in salute before he drank mud in your eye miss willard he said and gulped the whiskey down aint this a hell of a thing lieutenant said sergeant muldoon who had his own canteen full of whiskey havin a drink in the frances e willard home i mean he drank too all the little old ladies from the wctu must be spinning in their graves i figure i seen plenty o the womens christian temperance union down home in mississippi when i was growing up mutt answered i figured anything those sour old prunes were against had to be good enough for me to want to be for it and you know what put it all together i reckon i was right damn straight you were muldoon said taking another drink but that aint why i chose this here house for us daniels said herman muldoon laughed i know why you chose it its standing up you aint just joking even here in evanston north of the chicago city line devastation was heavy the northwestern university campus had been pounded hard the water filtration plant close by was just a ruin maybe it was the whiskeythough hed had only the one swigand maybe just frustration boiling up in him but he burst out god damn it to hell we dont need to be in evanston we should be takin the fight to the lizards down in chicago tell me somethin i dont know lieutenant muldoon said but as long as were here we got ourselves a nice fire goin an we can get snug as a couple of bugs in a rug the fireplace in the sitting room of the willard house still worked fine and there was anything but a shortage of wood to feed it a plaque on the wall of the room said it was dedicated to miss anna gordon frances willards lifelong companion and a world president of the wctu in her own right mutt wondered exactly whatlifelong companion meant lucille potter who was dead now had shown him that even if it meant what he suspected it did it wasnt necessarily as shocking and sinful as hed been brought up to believe you know what he said almost plaintively to muldoon you get stuck in a war you dont just set your body on the line everything you knew or thought you knew goes up into the front lines with you and some of it ends up dead even if you dont thats over my head lieutenant muldoon said im a dumb noncom nothin else but i leave the thinking to officers like you he laughed to show mutt wasnt supposed to take him all that seriously what i think is sounds like you could use another drink id like to dont you doubt it for a minute daniels answered but if im gonna keep track of this platoon full of wild men i cant afford to get me lit up later he wondered if god had been listening to him a brilliant yellowwhite light blazed through the southfacing window of the sitting roam printing his shadow against the far wall the one with the plaque on it it reminded him of the way a flashbulb could do the same thing but a flashbulb was there and then it was gone while this light was not only brighter than any flashbulb but went on for several seconds though it got fainter and redder as time went on the ground jerked under daniels feet as he exclaimed in surprise and alarm he heard a report that reminded him of a big artillery piece being fired maybe a hundred yards away the few shards of glass that remained in the sittingroom window blew out by luck none of them pierced him or muldoon what thehell was that the sergeant burst out biggest darn boom ive ever been through and ive been through some doozies somebodys ammunition dump going up maybe hope to jesus it was theirs and not ours yeah mutt went to the window to see what he could see muldoon joined him a moment later for perhaps half a minute they stared south together then very softly and not in the least irreverently mutt whispered goddamn muldoons head bobbed up and down he seemed to have lost the power of speech mutt had seen plenty of explosions and their aftermaths hed seen an ammunition dump go up too maybe from a lucky hit maybe because somebody got carelessnot enough was left afterwards for anyone to be sure but hed never seen anything like this he had no idea how high into the night the glowing cloud mounted miles that was all he could be sure of other thing was the base of that cloud looked a lot farther away than hed figured it wouldwhich meant the explosion was even bigger than hed guessed goodgodalmightydamnwillyoulookitthat muldoon said as if words had just been invented and nobody quite knew yet where they stopped and started mutt had the feeling that words to describe what he was seeing hadnt been invented yet and maybe never would be whatwas he seeing anyhow pursuing his earlier thought he said that aint no ammo dump you could blow up all the ammo in the world and it wouldnt make a cloud like that there one yeah muldoon agreed almost with a sigh whatever it is it came down on the lizards heads not ours look where its at lieutenantthats the part of shytown we retreated out of yeah youre right mutt said maybe we was lucky to get out of there when we did or maybe he stopped his eyes going wide or maybe an i hate like hell to say it the brass aint so dumb after all what the hell you talkin about uh sir muldoon said then he got a faraway look on his face too jesus mary and joseph lieutenant you think we pulled back on purpose so those scaly bastards could walk right into that big boom like they was moths divin into a fire dont know if its so but it stands to reason daniels answered the russians they figured out last year how to make one of them big bombs the lizards use and the nazis they fired one off last week i hear lessn the radios tellin more liesn usual fat lot of good it did em too muldoon retorted the lizards went and blew one of their cities to hell and gone right afterwards mutt refused to let that distract him if the reds can do it and the goddamn nazis can do it though why the hell cant we you think we dont got a bunch o guys with thick glasses and what dyou call emsslide rules thats ittryin to figure out how to make our own bombs youre crazy if you do and you aint never seen an explosion like that and neither have i so what do you think its liable to be that makes sense sounds like muldoon said reluctantly then he brightened jeez if thats what it was lieutenant a whole bunch o lizards and all their gear just went up in smoke reckon that was the idea daniels thought back to the crew whod been hiding the big crate in what looked like more rubble had they been setting the bomb there so it would be waiting for the lizards when they advanced in pursuit of the withdrawing americans he didnt know for sure no way he ever would but he couldnt think of any better reason for wanting to conceal a crate he laughed youd have a devil of a time proving him wrong that was for sure lets say it was one o those bombs lieutenant muldoon persisted when the germans used one next thing you know the lizards knocked one of their towns flat like i said they gonna do the same thing to us mutt hadnt thought about that now that he did he found he didnt fancy any of the answers that popped into his head damfino he said at last well just have to wait and find out seems like to me thatd be a damned ugly way to fight a war wouldnt it you blew up all o my guys in this city over here so ill go and blow up all o yours in that one over yonder shit thats what the krauts and the limeys were doin to each other when the lizards got here muldoon said but doin it with one bomb to a city makes you start runnin out o cities pretty damn quick lordy dont it just mutt said like two guys playin russian roulette cept theyre pointin the guns at each other an five o the chambers are loaded maybe all six of em you come to that the cloud to the south of them was fading now dispersing the wind sweeping it away toward lake michigan pretty soon it would be gone but the horrible dilemmas it raised would not disappear so soon uneasily mutt looked north east west and then last of all south once more toward and past the dissipating cloud what you tryin to do lieutenant muldoon asked you tryin to figure out where the lizards are gonna drop the one they use to answer ours daniels scowled he didnt like being that obvious but he didnt want to be a liar either not when he was talking about something as important as this he sighed yeah he said the alarm hissed hideously when atvar woke for a moment he thought he was dreaming about the last time the alarm had gone off then incontestably his senses came to full alertness and the alarm was still yammering away and there was pshings face in the communicator screen just as it had been that dreadful alltoorecent night activate twoway voice atvar said to the computer as he had then whatever disaster his adjutant had to report it couldnt be so hideous as news of the deutsche with nuclear weapons so the fleetlord told himself even as he was asking pshing what now exalted fleetlord pshing began and then had trouble going on gathering himself he finally managed to continue exalted fleetlord i regret to have to inform you that the tosevites of the notempire of the united states detonated a fission bomb in the northern sector of the city known as chicago as our males had only just succeeded in occupying this sector and as the front lay not far north our concentrations in the area of the explosion and thus our losses appear to have been heavy a predator in the warm friendly deserts of home dug a pit in the sand and hid at the bottom when an animal stumbled into the pit it would scrabble at the loose sand but generally slide down deeper and deeper until the trapmaker came out and devoured it with a minimum expenditure of effort atvar felt now like a creature trapped in one of those sand pits no matter what he did on tosev things kept getting worse he gathered himself tell me the rest he said as if knowing the rest could somehow restore what the race had lost pshing clung to what had been normality with some of the same desperation atvar felt exalted fleetlord the bomb appears to have been of the same type as that which the deutsche employed against us that is to say some of the plutonium in it was stolen from us while the big uglies produced the rest for themselves but the american big uglies are on the other side of an immense ocean from the deutsche and the russkis atvar said and we have made air passage between the continental masses rare difficult and dangerous for the tosevites to attempt to think they could have smuggled the explosive metal across in one of the few successful flights he checked himself wait i am overlooking something exalted fleetlord by the tone of his interrogative cough pshing didnt see what atvar was missing water it is the curse of this world whether liquid or frozen atvar said the big uglies have so much of it to deal with they transport goods on it much more readily than ever became the norm back on home weve not properly dealt with their ships and boats because weve assumed them to be of relatively small importanceand because weve had so many other commitments on this miserable iceball of a world that seemed more urgent we may now be paying the price for our inability to think as the big uglies do pshing made an eloquent gesture of distaste if becoming like the big uglies is a condition for victory over them i for one would almost rather lose a distinct point atvar admitted were it only my own personal choice i should agree with you but we have committed ourselves to bringing this world and its noxious inhabitants under the rule of the emperor he cast down his eyes what would his sacred sovereign think when he learned of the difficulties the race was having in annexing tosev first reports of combat were already on the way home but at laggard lightspeed would have completed only about a sixth part of their journey for the emperor i would brave anything pshing said seeming to take fresh spirit sometimes atvar thought loyalty and reverence to the emperor were all that kept his males performing as they should on a world where the weather and the natives both seemed calculated to drive them mad atvar forced himself to think clearly even if not like a tosevite the composition of the bomb like the one the deutsche used means the americans will soon have more such weapons of production entirely native for that matter he added as if reminding himself they may already have more such weapons and be saving them for future strikes against us underestimating the capacity of the big uglies has caused us grief and misfortune ever since we arrived here pshing said truth atvar answered wearily even when we build their advances in technology into our planning as we did with the campaign against the deutsche we still underestimate themand pay the price for it he let out a long hissing sigh rouse the targeting specialists also rouse the shiplord kirel and summon him to the operations chamber we must plan our response to the american bomb it shall be done exalted fleetlord when kirel reached the operations chamber atvar couldnt decide if he looked sleepy or stunned a bit of both perhaps another nuclear weapon your adjutant tells me the shiplord said from the americans this time did i hear that correctly you did atvar said as at breslau our progress at chicago has been halted and the spearhead of our forces destroyed he hissed again this time thoughtfully in both instances we were led to impale ourselves on the bomb by unforced or lightly forced retreats on the part of the big uglies in future we shall be more wary a worthy plan exalted fleetlord kirel said but the very recent past has been extremely damaging to us have we any notion where the americans prepared their fission bomb i wish we did atvar said that site would no longer exist the americans cannot hide their program in an already radioactive area as the deutsche seem to be doing they are simply careful about allowing leaks to pinpoint their atomic piles and reprocessing plants that is a problem kirel saida goodsized understatement if they destroy fighting males with their bombs and we only civilians with ours do they not gain advantage from that some certainly but we also destroy industrial sites and were this planet not industrialized it would long since have been incorporated into the empire atvar answered kirel could not disagree with that atvar went on we also put pressure on the tosevites notempires to accommodate themselves to us while they still have a significant civilian population none of the tosevite empires and notempires we have bombed has yet chosen to accommodate itself to us kirel remarked but he let it go at that he knew better these days than to criticize atvar after a moment he called up the map of the united states and highlighted two cities the targeting specialists had chosen pointing to one he said here is a centrally located target exalted fleetlord if you want one atvar read the name of the place denver no i dont want that one see how relatively close our males to the east of it are the prevailing wind will sweep radioactive waste in among them truth kirel said very well then your adjutant gave me to understand that you are concerned about the big uglies traffic on the water he brightened the light that showed the other town this one is a waterside city and we have no great numbers of males nearby seattle atvar considered yes that is a good choice for exactly the reasons you name we shall bomb it the tosevites have begun this gamelet us see if they have the liver to play it out to the end leslie groves stared down at his hands they were big and blunt and battered the hands of a working engineer he didnt bite his nails though he was proud of that if he hadnt been so proud of it he probably would have started hed led the team that made the fat lady the bomb had worked exactly as advertised maybe better than advertised a big chunk of the north side of chicago would never be the samebut a whole bunch of lizards would never be the same either and that was the point of the exercise so i should be on easy street right he asked the walls in the privacy of his office he sometimes talked to himself one of these days hed do it in public so what he said out loud again people who didnt like him already thought he was crazy he didnt care if he gave them more ammunition hed got the job done crazy or not but he wasnt on easy street all he knew about jens larssen was that hed shot two people and then headed east the sentries at lowry had seen him ride by but they hadnt stopped him they hadnt known hed shot anybody they also hadnt known groves had ordered him back to his quarters in the boq to calm down groves slammed a fist onto the desk making papers and thein andout trays jump if i hadnt sent him back to lowry would he still be all right now he asked the walls didnt give him any answers he wished larssen hadnt gone east east was where the lizards lived you wouldnt think anybody would go running off to the lizards but you wouldnt think anybody would gun down a colonel and a noncom in cold blood either once larssen had done the shooting taking refuge with the lizards looked a lot more likely than it had before they hadnt managed to catch the son of a bitch either one thing larssen had proved traveling crosscountry from white sulphur springs to chicago and then from denver to hanford and back again he knew how to live off the land you couldnt count on him freezing to death in a colorado winter or doing something dumb to give himself away if he was heading toward the lizards he might well get to them next question groves said in his orderly fashion what will he do if he does get to them will he spill his guts by all the signs larssen hated the met lab and anybody who had anything to do with it sure hed blamed hexham for the breakup with his wife but that had sprung from the secrecy surrounding the project too so the sixtyfour dollar question was if he got to the lizards would he blab about what was going on in denver if he did the town would become radioactive gas and dust in short order no less than the americans the lizards were playing for keeps as if he needed more proof of that he turned on the batterypowered radio hed ordered into the office when news of the destruction of seattle came over the wires when the set warmed up he caught an announcer in the middle of a word veral hundred thousand believed dead as weve told you before newly released information from the secret white house indicates that one of them was vice president henry wallace who was visiting war workers in the stricken city to improve their morale groves whistled softly and turned off the radio thatwas news the last time hed seen fdr a few months before the president had looked like death warmed over if he did drop dead who was next in line now the secretary of state assuming he was still alivegroves didnt know for sure president cordell hull he thought about that hed always figured wallace for a custardhead so hull might be an improvement all the same he hoped roosevelt would die of old age at about a hundred and thirtyone he turned the radio back on the newsman was still talking about the hideous things that had happened to seattle the same kinds of things had happened to berlin and washington and tokyo and munich and to the lizards outside moscow and breslau and inside chicago after a while hearing them repeated numbed the brain not so they seemed unreal but so their horrors no longer struck the mind as quite so horrific as with anything else acquaintance made what had once been unimaginable take on the comforting cloak of familiarity men had gone through four years of trench warfare in world war i and thought mans inhumanity to man could sink no lower then just to prove they were wrong theyd found ways to bomb noncombatants from the air and now more than half a dozen atomic bombs had been used with more liable to come how soon would those dreadful clouds come to be taken for grantedby those who survived them but if its that or letting the lizards conquer us groves asked again the walls were silent he didnt need their answer not to that question the second bomb had already gone out of denver when the time came people would use it and a lizard force would go up in fiery ruin and then very likely an american city would join that force on the pyre would anything be left of the country when it was over what was that line doctors usedthe operation was a success but the patient died if the lizards finally gave up but you presided over nothing but devastation afterwards had you won that had a flip side though if you didnt do everything you could to stop the lizards and they ended up conquering you what then you couldnt plan revenge against them down the line the way you could against an earthly neighbor if you lost now it was forever maybe therell be some pieces left to pick up after all this is done groves said have to hope so anyhow vyacheslav molotov did not care for meetings that convened at two in the morning stalin was notorious for calling meetings at hours like that molotov concealed his distaste the stony countenance he raised as a shield against rapacious capitalists and alien imperialist aggressors also helped protect him from his own superior stalin seemed amiable enough at the moment offering him vodka a glass of tea it was made from leaves flavored with blackberry extract and pretty vile cakes sweetened with honey and cigarettes of coarse russian tobaccothe condemned man ate a hearty meal ran through molotovs mind stalin could be most appalling just after hed been most polite now he drank and ate and blew smoke up toward the ceiling of the little kremlin room he used as his own at last quite casually he remarked i have learned something interesting about the explosivemetal bombs the germans and americans used against the lizards and what is that iosef vissarionovich molotov asked that they were made with metal that damned german managed to smuggle back through poland a pity i know but we couldnt reasonably have expected him to survive reasonably stalin said it as if it were a swear word his throaty georgian accent made the term sound even more menacing but then he went on no weve known he got through for some time nothing we can do about that now but make sure no similar mistakes happen in future molotov wondered how many men had died or gone to thegulag expiating such mistakes stalin continued no this thing i have learned has nothing to do with that it was obtained by our diligent wireless operators monitoring lizard frequencies this is good molotov said nodding we cannot place inconspicuous intelligence operatives among them so we had better learn something by monitoring their communications he waited stalin did not go on at last he had to ask what did the diligent wireless operators learn from the lizards in the space of a heartbeat stalins face went from mild and serene to coldly furious a film seemed to draw itself over his eyes giving his gaze the menacing steadiness of a serpents molotov had seen the transition many times it never failed to alarm him when that unwinking stare appeared on the general secretarys countenance dreadful things followed hissing out the words stalin said vyacheslav mikhailovich they learned the bombs the hitlerites and capitalists used were made partly from the explosive metal stolen from the lizards and partly from that which they manufactured themselves this is not surprising molotov said our physicists told us neither of the other parties with the explosive metal had enough for a bomb of his ownthat is how we exploded ours first last summer he stopped in chagrin for once his mouth had outrun his brains in an entirely different tone of voice he said oh i see the difficulty comrade general secretary do you stalins gaze was even more hooded than beforekhorosho ochen khorosho i thought i should have to draw you an illustration the nazis have made this explosive metal for themselves the americans have made this explosive metal for themselves his voice grew soft and deadly why have we not made this explosive metal for ourselves molotov gulped iosef vissarionovich our physicists warned from the outset that this would be a slow project requiring well over a year not merely a time measured in months theyd spoken of two or three years or even more but he hadnt dared tell stalin that we had so much to do to bring the soviet union to a point where it could hope to resist the onslaughts of the fascists and capitalists that in such matters as abstract research we lagged behind them we have made great strides in catching up but we cannot have everything at once but this is something the soviet union requires stalin said as if demanding explosive metal could make it spring into being on the table next to the cakes if the incompetents now laboring to accomplish the task cannot succeed we should uproot them and bring in others with great understanding of the subject molotov had been dreading that pronouncement since igor kurchatov told him they would for the time being have no more than one bomb he saw nothing but disaster in dismantling the team kurchatov had assembled for all practical purposes everyone in the soviet union who knew anything about nuclear physics was gathered at the carefully disguised farm outside moscow if that set of physicists was liquidated only charlatans would be left to try to build an explosivemetal bomb the soviet union could not afford that cautiously as if he were walking through a minefield he said they need more time to do what they said they would displacing them i think might have a disruptive effect on our progress displacing them would wreck the project as effectively as if an explosivemetal bomb had gone off on that disguised farm but he couldnt tell stalin that disagreeing with the soviet ruler even indirectly made his heart thud and sweat spring out on his high forehead stalin looked petulant they have shown themselves to be bunglers and you want to give them more time to prove it they are not altogether bunglers comrade general secretary molotov answered sweating harder had it not been for the bomb they did succeed in detonating moscow would now be overrun he wondered if they could have carried on the fight against the lizards from kuibishev he might yet be faced with the prospect of finding out that was one bomb stalin said we need more the hitlerites will have more which means therodina will be endangered even leaving the lizards out of the account hitler will not use the bombs against us while the lizards lie between germany and the soviet union molotov said we shall have our own by the time they are cleared from poland he briefly contemplated the irony of a georgian talking about the russian motherland but did not come close to having the nerve to remark on it stalin said the devils uncle take poland he used russian expressions all right sometimes with a sardonic twist that showed he knew how strange they could sound in his mouth others as now as if he really felt himself to be a russian how without more bombs are we going to clear the lizards from our own land winter is our ally molotov insisted we have gained a good many kilometers south of moscow and our forces are also advancing in the ukraine and in the west and north the lizards have reduced the forces opposing us to concentrate on the germans which means only that they hold us in contempt stalin snapped the nazis they think are more dangerous to them but us they can deal with us at any time and why do they think this because the nazis can make these bombs on their own and we it seems cannot it all comes down to these bombs molotov thought about pointing out that the lizards had reduced their forces in the north and west of russia to attack germany before they knew the nazis had explosivemetal bombs and that the one the germans set off came as a complete and most unpleasant surprise to them he kept quiet though this once it wasnt because he feared what would happen if he contradicted stalinalthough that would be bad in the end though the general secretary was right it did all come down to those bombs if the soviet union could make more it might survive if it couldnt it would go under if not to the lizards then to the germans and americans kurchatov and his crewcould make more bombs molotov was certain of that he was just as certain nobody else in the soviet union could in any conceivably useful amount of time stalin glared at molotov in lieu of glaring at the entire world these bunglers you have gathered together vyacheslav mikhailovich have six months if they have not made an explosivemetal bomb by then they shall suffer the consequencesand so shall you molotov licked his lips stalin did not forget threats like that molotov took a deep breath comrade general secretary if that is how you feel call the peoples commissariat of internal affairs and have them deal with me now the kurchatov group cannot make us a bomb within six months no one else you can find will do better he hated taking such a risk stalin might very well ring up the nkvd in which case the soviet union would have a new foreign commissar in short order but defusing stalin now would also defuse the threat half a year away stalin kept staring at him now musingly molotov did not talk back to him that was like a law of nature molotov went hot and cold at the same time his legs felt like jelly facing churchill even facing hitler was one thing facing stalin quite another he was in stalins power and he knew it at last the general secretary said well we shall see molotov almost spilled out of his chair and onto the floor in reliefhed won hed managed to talk the leader of his country into not destroying itand incidentally into not destroying him it shouldnt have been as hard as it was hard or easy though hed survived so had kurchatovs team the war would go on and the soviet union too liu han hated peking winter she was from hundreds and hundreds ofli farther south the cold months were bad enough there here every time she went outdoors she was acutely reminded the mongolian steppe lay just to the west she piled on quilted garments till she looked like a perambulating pile of bedding and she was still cold nevertheless tonight she was out on the streets making her way onhutungs and broader avenues toward the forbidden city where the little scaly devils like the chinese emperors before them made their headquarters let the icy wind do with her as it would tonight she wanted to be close to the little devils center she turned to nieh hoting i hope their emperor has a happy birthday she said savagely yes his smile was more a predators grimace than one of genuine mirth they are the strangest creatures in all the worldthe little devils i mean they celebrated their emperors birthdaythey call it hatching daysix months ago too in summertime how can a man or even a scaly devil have two birthdays each year they tried to explain this to me when i was on their plane that never came down liu han said they were talking about different worlds and different years i didnt understand much of it im afraid she hung her head time in the plane that never came down in the scaly devils camp and in the city had shown her how ignorant she was if shed stayed in her village the rest of her life as most chinese peasant women did she never would have known nieh said yes they are from a different world that is so i had not thought on what it might mean for birthdays and such to have a world with a different year from ours even knowing things sometimes was not enough shed seen that too you also had to know how the things you knew fit together knowing one thing here and one there wasnt worth much if you could put them together you had something how much longer she asked him he took a watch from his pocket looked at it and quickly replaced it fifteen minutes he said if you openly showed you had a watch these days you ran the risk of being mistaken for one of the little devils rich running dogs or conversely having the lackeys think you were a resistance leader who needed to know exactly what time it was so your raid would go as youd planned if you were in fact such a leader you didnt want people to know it fifteen minutes save for when she was in labor liu han had never known time to pass so slowly will we be able to hear the songs were listening for she asked guarding her meaning in case any of the people milling around was a spy oh yes nieh assured her im sure my friend from the big wine vat will sing very loud and clear and he is far from the only man in the chorus he lowered his voice careful even though he was speaking in code this song will be heard all over china tonight liu han hugged herself partly against the numbing cold and partly from excitement if all went as she hoped she would soon have the beginning of her revenge on the little scaly devils who had brought her so much grief a boy ran past her with a bundle of strips of paper in one hand and a paste pot in the other he found a blank stretch of wall slapped paste onto it and put up a couple of the strips then he ran to look for a spot where more might go you had a clever idea there liu han said nodding toward the ragamuffin picking boys who cant read makes it harder for the little scaly devils to trace those messages all the boys know is that someone gave them money to put them up doctrine nieh said if you use someone for a purpose like that the less he knows the better he chuckled our singers are the same way if they knew just what sort of songs we were asking them to perform some of them might want to do something else instead yes liu han thought about doctrine nieh often seemed to know what to do without having to consider first the thing he called doctrine told him what he needed almost as if it let him toss the coins for thei ching inside his own head that made it a valuable tool but he also sometimes seemed unable to think outside the framework his doctrine gave him as if it were not tool but master the communists in the scaly devils prison camp had acted the same way shed heard christian missionaries gabble about a truth they claimed to have the communists thought they owned truth too it sometimes made them uncomfortable allies even if she could never have struck the little devils such a blow without them nieh hoting was casually tapping the palm of his hand against a trouser leg his mouth shaped silent words eight seven six as he said the wordfive a sharp deepbang came from inside the walls of the forbidden city early nieh said but not so bad the grin he was wearing belied even the partial criticism hed hardly finished the sentence when anotherbang went off and then another liu han felt as if she were drunk onsamshu though shed had nothing stronger than tea we give the emperor a happy birthday she said and added the emphatic cough for good measure two more bombs went off among the scaly devils then one then silence nieh hoting frowned we had eight arranged for in all here in peking he said perhaps two timers failed or perhaps they ran late and the little devils found them before they could blow up that made liu han remember the bombs had not got in among the little scaly devils by themselves the communists had promised her theyd care for the families of the beastshow men killed in the explosions and she believed them they had a good reputation in such things but money did not pay for the anguish the wives and children of those men would know she knew how hard losing a family was it had happened to her twice now had she not had her idea those beastshow men would still be living working at their trade she hung her head hurting the little scaly devils might justify what shed done but could not make her proud of it the little devils hissing alarms started going off gunfire came from inside the forbidden city that wasnt the raiders that was the little scaly devils shooting either at innocent people there were waiters and other servants whod also still be alive and well if she hadnt had her idea she remembered them too or at one another suddenly liu han and nieh hoting stood almost alone not far from the walls of the forbidden city people in peking had seen a lot of war they knew that when explosions went off anyplace nearby going elsewhere was one of the best ideas you could have she started drifting away with the crowd and tugged at niehs sleeve when he didnt move fast enough to suit her youre right he said sheepishly once shed finally got his attention theyd just ducked back into ahutung out of sight of the wall when a little scaly devil up there started shooting with his automatic rifle a moment later others up and down the wall poured fire at the humans out and about in the night what had been a withdrawal became a stampede some people screaming in panic others because they were hit hurry liu han cried we have to get away if they send their males out of the forbidden city theyll slaughter everyone they can find nieh hurried but to her surprise wore a big fierce grin on his usually solemn face whats funny liu han demanded indignantly theyre killing us that is whats funny he answered which made no sense to her till he explained they play into our hands if they kill people who had nothing to do with setting off the bombs among them they do nothing to help themselves and only make people hate them even some of their lackeys will think twice about backing them now and may come over to us or give us useful information the scaly devils would have been wiser to do nothing till they found out who had bombed them then to strike hard at us that way they could have claimed they were punishing the guilty do you understand hed taken that tonealmost as if he were a village schoolmasterwith her before when he was instructing her in matters of doctrine she thought as she fled nieh looked at the world coldbloodedly more so than anyone else shed ever known but he was a war leader such men could not afford to be anything but coldblooded she said well have to stay in the shadows for a while till the little devils stop hounding us nieh hoting shook his head no now we hit them harder than ever harass them in every way we can so we keep them too busy to launch a proper campaign against us if we can keep them off balance they will be foolish liu han thought about that as they trotted along through thehutungs they went arm in arm to keep from being swept apart by the crowds surging away from the forbidden city she decided it made sense if you were in a fight with someone you didnt hit him once and then stand back to see what hed do next you hit him again and again as often as you could to make sure he gave up or at least didnt have the chance to hit you back the landlord of their roominghouse screamed at them to close the door and stop letting out the heat whats all the commotion outside he added i dont know nieh and liu han said together and then laughed shed picked up a good deal of doctrine listening to him if she showed undue knowledge the landlord might wonder how she came by it hsia shoutao sat at a table in the eating room with him was a pretty young woman in a brocaded silk dress with so many slits in it that liu han wondered how she kept from freezing to death a jar ofsamshu sat between them by the foolish expression on hsias face it was not the first one that had been there is all well he called to nieh hoting i think so nieh answered with a pointed glance toward hsias companion she glared at him like a cat with ruffled fur if she wasnt a security risk liu han had never seen one could hsia keep his mouth shut after he took her upstairs to see her body liu han hoped so but hope wasnt enough in a game of this importance join us hsia shoutao asked no thank you nieh hoting answered rather coldly the pretty girl muttered something through her painted lips liu han had no doubt it wasnt a compliment she was pleased at niehs answer she didnt want to sit at the same table with hsia even if he had another woman to distract him from her she and nieh hoting went to the stairway together she saw hsia smirking at the two of them which only made her more angry with him the stairwell was cold and dark she stumbled nieh caught her elbow before she could fall thank you she said my pleasure he answered and then laughed at himself i sound like a perfect member of the bourgeoisie dont i but itis my pleasure this was your idea comrade i wouldnt want you to hurt yourself just as it begins to unfold you deserve the credit thank you she said again her room was a couple of floors higher than niehs but she didnt mind when he walked up past his floor with her she wondered why she didnt maybe shed decided to pay hsia shoutao back for that smirk maybe she felt filled with the triumph of finally paying back the scaly devils for all theyd done to her her mouth twisted maybe after so long she just wanted a man her hand was all right in its wayit knew exactly what she likedbut it couldnt hold her and hug her afterwards of course not all men did that either but the hope was always there shed told nieh she didnt want to lie with him that hadnt been long ago either neither of them mentioned it now liu han opened the door to her room a lamp still flickered in there she used the flame to light the little brazier that gave the place such heat as it hadnot much even after shed shut the door behind them nieh hoting still hesitated its all right she said its better than all right in fact that made him smile he didnt smile often when he did his whole face changed it wasnt hard and watchfulcommittedany more not only did he seem happy he seemed surprised at being happy as if he wasnt sure how he was supposed to react nokang to lie on up here liu han said sadly even with blanketsshe pointed to the mound under which she burrowedit wont be warm well have to make it warm then he said and smiled that uncertain smile once more it grew broader when she smiled back at him he glanced toward the little brass lamp shall i blow that out i dont think it matters she answered were going to be covered up anyhow true but nieh did blow out the lamp plunging the room into blackness liu han got out of her layers of clothes as fast as she could and dove beneath the covers nieh almost stepped on the beddingand herwhen he walked over in the dark after undressing himself she shivered when he ran his hands up and down her body partly from excitement and partly because they were cold but he was warm elsewhere his erection rubbed against her thigh when she took him in her hand for a moment he shivered too probably for both the reasons she had he kissed her she stroked his cheek it was almost as smooth as her own not furry with beard or rough with the nubs of scrapedoff whisker as bobby fiores had been niehs chest was smooth and hairless too with nothing like the black jungle the american had had growing there when shed first been forced to couple with bobby fiore shed thought that mat of hair disgusting then shed got used to it now smoothness felt strange his mouth was warm too it came down on her left breast his tongue teased her nipple she sighed and rested a hand on the back of his head but although the caresses felt good they also reminded her of the babyeven if it was only a daughterwho should have been nursing there his mouth moved to her other breast his hand took its place squeezing her hard enough to be pleasurable and not quite enough to hurt she sighed again his other hand was busy between her legs not yet stroking her most secret places but teasing all around them till shealmostforgot how cold the room was he understood patience in a way shed had to teach to bobby fiore after a while he grew too patient to suit her she closed her fingers around him gently tugging back his foreskin he gasped and scrambled onto her she spread her legs and arched her back to make his entry easy the darkness was so complete she could not see his face above hers it didnt matter she knew that when their lips werent joined it had to bear the same intent inward searching expression as her own his hips bucked steadily driving him in and out of her her breath came in short gasps as if shed run a long way nieh grunted and shuddered but kept moving inside her until a moment later she also quivered in release then still thoughtful he rolled off beside her so his weight which suddenly seemed much heavier wouldnt flatten her he touched her cheek you are everything i thought youd be and more besides he said the words warmed her and left her wary at the same time i am not going to be your toy or yourwhat do you say your lackey thats it because of what we just did she said her voice came out sharper than shed intended but that was all right too he needed to know he couldnt take advantage of her in bed or out because shed lain with him once the communists preached of better days for women as shed seen from hsia shoutao not all of them meant what they said she thought nieh was different now shed find out fair enough he said he sounded wintry too as he went on and just because youve lain down with me dont think i will press for your schemes unless they have merit then he softened that by leaning up on an elbow and kissing her the one tonight certainly did i am glad you think so she said had she been wondering if she could use her body to influence nieh and advance her own position among the revolutionaries who fought the scaly devils she had to admit to herself that it had crossed her mind in a mans world a womans body was sometimes the only weapon she hadand she did want to rise to where all her ideas were taken seriously the better to avenge herself against the little devils what nieh said marked a better way though comrade we have a bargain as if by accident his hands strayed along her body toward the joining of her legs how shall we seal it he asked slyly she hesitated feeling him stir against her side and start to rise she wouldnt have minded another round butnotlike that she said and took his hand away didnt you listen to what i told you to her relief he didnt sound angry when he answered i listened but sometimesoftenpeople do nothing but mouth empty phrases the kuomintang for instance calls itself a revolutionary party his contemptuous snort showed what he thought of that but you liu han you mean what you say this is something i need to know good enough liu han said after a moment we seal it like this then now she kissed him it is enough for now the emperors holographic image beamed down on the shiplords celebration aboard theth emperor hetto on three worlds of the empire billions from the race the rabotevs and the hallessi were celebrating their sovereigns hatching day at just this moment knowing that made atvar feel part of the great community the race had built not the embattled outsider into which he sometimes seemed transformed by the pestilential war on tosev some of the shiplords were behaving so boisterously he wondered whether theyd illicitly tasted ginger before their shuttlecraft brought them here to the bannership he didnt like to think highranking commanders could fall victim to the insidious tosevite herb but on tosev what he liked and the truth were oftentoo oftenfar apart there over to one side floated kirel his usual standoffishness forgotten talking animatedly with a couple of males who had been of strahas faction back in the days when straha was around to have a faction atvar was glad to see his chief subordinate happier than usual less glad to see the company with which he chose to enjoy himself on the other fork of the tongue a considerable majority of males had voted for atvars ouster after the sssr set off its nuclear bomb so for kirel to ignore all of them would have left him on good terms with only a few shiplords and there was poor hardworking pshing he had in his hand a squeezebulb filled with the fermented juices of certain tosevite fruits the big uglies being unable to enjoy the intoxicating effects of ginger made do with ethanol and various flavorings males of the race found some of those vilewhy anyone even a big ugly would drink whiskey was beyond atvarbut others might be worth exporting to home after the conquest was complete atvar drifted over to pshing checked himself by snagging a grab ring with the claws of one toe how does it feel not to be waking me up to report some disaster he asked pshings eyes didnt quite track hed probably had several bulbs full of red wine already exalted fleetlord it feelswonderful he exclaimed tacking on an emphatic cough that threatened to become a coughing fit stinking big uglies are quiet for a change indeed atvar said now if only they remain so he floated toward the console that dispensed bulbs of potations brought from home and toward the local drinks kept in bins with lids alongside it he didnt want to celebrate the emperors hatching day with a product of tosev the emperor represented home and all it stood for far better to drink hudiparberry brandy then than wine the male who came into the chamber was conspicuous not only for his subdued body paint but also for the purposeful way he went about looking for atvar the fleetlords momentary good spirits flickered and blew out rokois was pshings subordinate taking the duty for the adjutant so he could enjoy himself if rokois was here instead of waiting in front of a communicator something had gone wrongagain atvar had a strong impulse to hide himself inside a floating cluster of males so rokois could not spot his body paint just for once he like pshing deserved a respite from bad news but even if he escape that he would not be able to evade the emperors eyes some trick of the hologram made them follow you wherever you were in the chamber and had that trick not been there he knew his duty too well to flee from it but oh the temptation instead of fleeing the adjutants assistant atvar pushed off the console toward him he did carry along the bulb of hudiparberry brandy rokois folded into the posture of respectful obedience and began exalted fleetlord i regret to report that although he had not spoken loudly those words were plenty to bring nearsilence to the festival chamber atvar was far from the only male to have noted his arrival and to wonder what news was urgent enough to disturb the fleetlord at the celebration had britain or nippon or some other previously discounted tosevite empire or notempire touched off an atomic bomb had deutschland or the united states or even the sssr touched off another one tell me rokois atvar interrupted what do you regret to report now exalted fleetlord the big uglies appear to have discovered our custom of honoring the emperors hatching day the adjutants assistant answered certain of them were invited to perform with their trained tosevite beasts at observances of the day in cities on the eastern part of the main continental mass this is in the large populous notempire known as china due to inadequate security they were able to smuggle explosives in amongst our officers and administrators along with their beasts they died themselves then atvar said defending against males willing to do that was next to impossible fortunately such fanatics were rare even among the fanatical big uglies exalted fleetlord in many instances they did rokois answered we captured a couple of these males and disarmed their explosives before detonation they insist they were duped that they thought the bombs were in fact video equipment to allow us to record their performances a rising mutter of anger and outrage came from the shiplords atvar understood that he felt it himself if you told lies you didnt need to recruit fanatics without fear of death any race the race included had its share of dupes as he usually did in the face of misfortune he tried to look on tin bright side of things if we have some of these beast exhibitors in custody they may be able to lead us to the males who induced then to undertake their missions may events prove you correct exalted fleetlord rokois said the timing devices on the captured explosives are of nipponese manufacture although the males unanimously insist chinese were the intermediaries who paid them and arranged for their performances more than one level of dupery may have been involved atvar said or conversely the timers may have been used merely to deceive us further investigation should shed more light on that what else have you learned there is one other thing to support the view that this was a chinese blow against us rokois answered in the areas surrounding several of our administrative centers we have found small handbills that if translated correctlythe chinese write with a peculiarly abominable scriptdemand the return of the hatchling taken from the big ugly female liu han for purposes of research the big uglies may not make demands of us atvar said indignantly then he wondered why not in matters military they had earned wary attention if not full equality we shall have to evaluate this further truth exalted fleetlord rokois held no responsibility there and was blithely aware of it he disseminated policy he did not shape it after a moments hesitation he went on exalted fleetlord reports indicate that casualties among senior administrators and officers in china may be especially heavy they naturally had seats closest to the big uglies presenting the beast shows and so took the full brunt of the blasts yes that does make sense atvar sighed again no help for it some junior males will get new marks and colors for their body paint some of them wont have the experience or the sense to do their jobs as well as they should as they show that well cull them and put others in their place we shall rule china we shall rule tosev and i shall drink enough hudiparberry brandy to forget im orbiting above this miserable hateful world despite that gloomy thought his outward demeanor inspired rokois who exclaimed itshall be done exalted fleetlord yes spirits of past emperors aiding us it shall now atvar paused before resuming when you came in here i feared you were bringing me word the big uglies had touched off another nuclear device the emperor be praised i was wrong instead of lowering his eye turrets he turned them toward the hologram of his ruler may it not come to pass rokois burst out also gathering strength from the image of the emperor indeed may it not the fleetlord squirted a long pull of brandy down his throat teerts radar gave him a new target he didnt have it visually not yet all he saw through his windscreen were clouds and through occasional rents in them the wavechopped surface of the ocean that stretched between the main and lesser continental masses he was just as glad not to be flying over deutschland any more maybe munchen had deserved what the race gave it he was no targeting specialist or shiplord to be able to judge such things from full knowledge flying over the glassy ruins of what had been a large city though left him glum the sight made him think of tokyo which but for him might still be standing to hate the nipponese was one thing to visit on them nuclear fire quite another they would have visited the same fire on the race had they possessed it teerts knew that full well it salved his conscience but not enough he thought about tasting ginger but decided to wait until his bodys need could no longer be denied i think faster with ginger he said first making sure his radio was off i dont think better or i think i dont think better anyhow he puzzled through that finally deciding it was what he meant he dove down beneath the clouds this would be the third ship hed attacked on his flight to the lesser continental mass they seemed almost as thick as parasites on the water the males with the fancy body paint were right to start paying more attention to them as far as he was concerned the race had automatically discounted water and travel on it trust the big uglies to do things wed never think of he muttered you could use up a lot of aircraft and a lot of munitions trying to suppress the tosevites nautical commerce if you tried shutting down all of it would you have any aircraft left to commit to other tasks that wasnt his judgment to make but attacking ships wasnt like blowing cities off the face of tosev it was a real part of war easily comprehensible to any male at all for once elifrim had assigned him something he didnt loathe there sheet metal and wood crude and homely slow and wallowing belching a trail of smoke into the cloudy sky you didnt need missiles for this hed used up his laserguided bombs on the two previous targets but he still had cannon and plain bombs taken from a tosevite arsenal they would do the job the ship swelled monstrously fast his killercraft screamed toward it in a shallow dive the targeting computer told him to release the bombs the aircrafts nose tried to come up as they dropped away he and the autopilot kept it on its proper course he spotted tosevites scrambling about on the deck of the ship the killercraft bucked in the air as he thumbed the firing button of the cannon he poured shells into the ship before the blasts from the bombs and the water they kicked up obscured it from sight goodbye big uglies he said pulling out of the dive so he could make another pass and inspect the damage he hadnt sunk this one radar told him as much before he got a good look at it but smoke spurted from places it hadnt before some of the big uglies were down and motionless now others struggling to repair the damage hed done and othersfire spurted from the front end of the ship again and again and again they had an antiaircraft gun aboard and were using it with great vim even if the shells they threw up werent coming very close to him praise the emperors name for that he said if he was unlucky enough to get shot down twice he wouldnt be taken prisoner not here hed go into the water and see whether he froze before he drowned or vice versa this time he fired a long burst at the tosevites popgun he knew hed damaged their vessel some more and had no intention of coming round again to find out how much that antiaircraft cannon might not have been wrecked up above the clouds once more to broaden the radars range he looked forward to landing in what the locals called florida the airbase in southern france from which hed been flying had turned unpleasantly cold by his standards if not by those of tosev but florida stayed close to temperate throughout its winter season even if the air was moist enough to make him inspect his scales for mold whenever he got up in the morning he checked his fuel supply the attack runs hed made had left him rather low on hydrogen to make it all the way across this ridiculously wide stretch of water the race kept a couple of refueling aircraft flying above the ocean for such contingencies satellite relay quickly put him in touch with one of them he swung north for a rendezvous guiding the prong from the refueling aircraft into his own took delicacy and concentration he was glad he hadnt tasted beforehand he knew how jumpy and impatient he got with ginger in him unfortunately he also knew how sad and morose he got with no ginger in him he attacked one more ship on his way to florida the fog was so thick over the water that he carried out the run almost entirely by radar he saw the wallowing tosevite craft only at the last instant just in time to add a few rounds from his cannon to the bombs hed dropped before long he left behind the clouds and fog the sky above him was a deep blue the water below an even deeper shade of the same color for once tosev seemed almost beautifulif you liked blue it was a color far less common on home than here a proper world to his way of thinking was supposed to have an abundance of yellows and reds and oranges blue should have been an appetizer not a main course radar spotted the land ahead before he didbut radar was not concerned with aesthetics teerts didnt think much of the low damp terrain toward which he was flying its hideous humidity meant that everything not recently cleared was covered by a rank noxious coat of vegetation he wasnt any too fond of green either though he did prefer it to blue only the sandy beaches reminded him of home and they should have been broad expanses not narrow strips hemmed in by more of tosev s omnipresent water he sighed he wasnt going to have to do anything complicated from here on out so he let himself have some ginger i might as well be happy when i land he told the cockpit canopy as he followed the seacoast south toward his destination every so often hed fly over a little tosevite town some of them had ships in their harbors the aggressiveness the herb put in him made him want to blast those ships as he had the ones out on the ocean but the race had held this territory for a long time and any traffic was likely to be in authorized goods staying rational through that first jolt of pleasure and excitement was never easythe ships were just sitting there as if begging to be destroyed but teerts knew how to separate the urgings of the ginger from those he would have had without it he didnt let the herb make him as stupid as he once had the radar was linked to a map that listed the names of the cities over which he flew coming up was miami and past that the landing strip the race had taken for its own miami was easy to recognize being much the largest center the big uglies had built hereabouts he could see it coming up in the distance it had a large harbor with tens upon tens of ships teerts mouth fell open in gingerinduced amusement as he imagined the havoc he could wreak upon them with a good strafing run it was almostbut not quiteworth braving the wrath of his superiors once hed landed then right before his eyes the whole harborfor all he could tell the whole citywent up in a fireball ginger made you think faster that much he knew he swung the killercraft away from that fireball in as tight a turn as it would take he knew what the fireball was hed seen one of the same sort over the deutsch city jisrin had incinerated this one in fact wasnt quite so large as the other and looked to be a ground burst rather than one in the air but nothing could be mistaken for the explosion of a nuclear bomb the blast slapped the killercraft like a blow across the muzzle for a dreadful moment he thought he had no control the ocean here was supposed to be warmer than it was farther east and north but that didnt mean he wanted to go into it and if miami had just exploded in radioactive fire who would rescue him anyhow he was starting to review ejection procedures in his mind when the aircraft decided to answer the controls he wondered how much radiation hed picked up from being all too close to two nuclear blasts in a matter of days nothing he could do about that not now his next query was much more urgently relevant was his landing site still on the map he got on the radio flight leader teerts to south florida airbase are you there hed never before meant that question literally to his relief the answer came back in moments though it was hashed with static reading you clearly flight leader teerts were you damaged in the explosion was that could that have been teerts didnt blame the male for not wanting to say it out loud but the ginger in him made him impatient with subterfuge and euphemism that was a nuclear bomb in miami air base whatever we had in the city its gone now how could they have done that the male on the other end of the radio connection sounded stunned disbelieving our radar spotted no aircraft to deliver the weapon nor missiles either and weve chased the big uglies out of this peninsula they couldnt have smuggled the weapon in by land what does that leave maybe ginger really did make teerts think better not just faster or maybe his mission had freed his mind from the races usual patterns of thought without a moments hesitation he replied maybe they brought it in by water by water the fillip the male added to his interrogative cough made him sound incredulous not just curious how could they do that i dont know exactly how teerts right eye turret swung back toward the capped cloud still rising above miami but id say they seem to have managed atvar was growing to hate the reports he got from the targeting specialists and to hate the sessions he spent with kirel translating the recommendations from those reports into an order that would throw another city into the fire kirel called up a map of the united states once again exalted fleetlord denver is a recommended target along with this other more peripheral one there is enough radiation loose on this continental mass thanks to the big uglies atvar answered somehow catastrophe endlessly repeated didnt seem so catastrophic as it had the first time one tosevite atomic bomb had had the shiplords hissing for his skin now that the big uglies had touched off a whole string of them the males stopped worrying about atvar they had a new kind of war on their hands kirel said the emperor be praised we didnt delay another generation in attacking this planet as some of the budgetcutters proposed even if wed kept our nuclear armory intact wed have faced more nuclear weapons than we brought along we might not even have effected a planetfall let alone conquest truth atvar said this device you will note from the analysis was prepared entirely from the big uglies own plutonium they would have had nuclear arms all too soon in any case even if we had not come to this miserable world of course if we had come a generation later they might also have succeeded in fighting their own fullscale atomic war which would have solved most of our problems for us ours yes but not those of the colonization fleet kirel said if the big uglies slagged tosev themselves the colonization fleet could stop here just long enough to pick up reaction mass for the motors and then honorably return home atvar answered but since the big uglies have not quite wrecked the planet we cannot do so either we know limits they seem unaware of the concept we have spoken before of how the restraint we feel compelled to observe has been the tosevites biggest single safety factor kirel agreed he illuminated the other possible bomb site the targeting specialists had chosen i dont know why they reckon this place a candidate for annihilation exalted fleetlord by planetary standards its far away from everything only if you look at matters from the perspective of a male of the race atvar said to the tosevites in its own way it is as important a nexus as chicagowhich they went and destroyed themselves he added mentally you are going to choose the outoftheway site then kirel said not quite in resignation but with the clear intention of conveying that had he been fleetlord he would have come to a different conclusion well he wasnt fleetlord and atvar now had reason to hope he never would be a small or mediumsized crisis agitated males in a large one they got behind the leaders they had the fleetlord said that is my choice yes very well kirel said per your orders it shall be done we shall bomb this pearl harbor place ttomalss did not read chinese well he was one of the few males of the race who read chinese at all learning a separate character for each word struck him as far more trouble than it was worth and he had a computer to help him recognize the angular squiggles and remind him of what they meant how a big ugly ever learned to cope with this cumbersome system was beyond him he did not need to know a great many characters to decipher those on the strips of paper that had been brought up to him from cities throughout the eastern stretch of china the race occupied those strips had been found pasted up around sites the chinese tosevites had bombed some of them had been captured in the cases of beastshow males before the bombs in those cases exploded the tosevite female called liu han not only wanted her hatchling back she was in a position with the chinese who still resisted the races rule to make her demands widely known and to exert force to persuade the race to yield to them ttomalss turned an eye turret toward the hatchling in question that was partly in reaction to the demands for its return and partly a simple caution to make sure it wasnt getting into anything it shouldnt it could move around on all fours now and could reach for things with at least some chance of having a hand actually land on them and as always whatever it touched went straight into its mouth none of the beastshow males who hadnt blown themselves to small gory fragments admitted to having heard of liu han ttomalss wished hed never heard of her either given the amount of trouble her hatchling had caused him he might well have been delighted to give it back to her would that not have disrupted his research program as things were though he hated to abandon the experiment just when its results were beginning to seem interesting what have you to say for yourself he asked the hatchling and tacked on the usual interrogative cough at the end the hatchling turned its head to look at him hed been around big uglies enough that he no longer found that unnerving the creatures were just too poorly made to move their eyes as the race did the hatchlings face twisted into a tosevite gesture of amiability the rest of its features were far more mobile than ttomalss he didnt think that made it superior he thought it made the hatchling and its race even uglier than they would have been otherwise it screwed up its face and let out a noise that sounded amazingly like an interrogative cough it had done that two or three times already as best he could tell it began by making all sorts of sounds and then gradually started picking out those the beings around it used in their language he wondered if its vocal apparatus would be able to handle the language of the race by two or three thousand years after the conquest all the big uglies would be speaking that tongue they would unlikely as the notion now seemed be normal subjects like the rabotevs and hallessi a lot of them were good at languages with so many different ones on tosev that was hardly surprising but one of the things ttomalss needed to learn was how they would handle the races tongue when learning it from hatchlinghood if this hatchling was returned to liu han he would have to start that process over again tessrek stuck his head into the laboratory enjoy your little ugly while you have it he said what ttomalss would have enjoyed was sending tessrek out the airlock with no space suit the creature is not here to enjoy he said stiffly animals are to exploit not to befriend as the big uglies do remembering his earlier thought he added not that the tosevites are animals once the conquest is complete they will be our subjects it would be much more convenient if theywere animals tessrek said then this world would be ours even if they were barbariansremember the image of the tosevite warrior the probe sent home the swordswinging savage in rusty iron mounted on a beast im not likely to forget ttomalss hissed out a sigh would that that image were still truth on tosev it would have made his lifethe races lifeever so much simpler but he wasted only a moment on the barbarous past of the tosevites what do you mean enjoy the hatchling while i have it no decision to abandon it to the big uglies has reached me as far as i know the decision hasnt been made tessrek admitted but when it is made what do you think it will be everybodys eye turrets are swiveling every which way because of the atomic bombs the tosevites have started using against us but the chinese raids cost us a lot of capable males too if giving back one hatchling can get us a respite from more of those dont you think we ought to take it that depends ttomalss said judiciously if we do return the hatchling we encourage the big uglies to make other demands of us and then to harm us if we dont obey theyre supposed to be afraid of us not the other way round if they are they hide it very well tessrek said and who can blame them now that they have atomic weapons they can do us severe damage we may have to treat with them as equals nonsense ttomalss said automatically the race recognized no equals the rabotevs and hallessi had legal equality in most areas of life and had their own social hierarchies but their worlds were in the races hands even so yet on reflection maybe it wasnt nonsense tosev wasnt in the races hands not yet ttomalss still assumed it eventually would be but the assumption looked less and less assumable all the time tessrek said besides as i and other males have noted the presence of the small tosevite aboard this vessel has had noxious consequences for the local environment in short the creature still stinks many males would be glad to see it gone for that reason alone and have stated as much my personal attitude is that that viewpoint has a far more noxious odor than the tosevite ttomalss answered he did his best to disguise the stab of fear that ran through him if all the other researchers and psychologists banded together against his experiment it might be terminated regardless of its virtues that wasnt fair but sometimes it was the way the egg hatched he wondered if the big uglies let personalities get in the way of scientific research he doubted it otherwise how could they have so quickly moved forward from barbarism to rivaling a race unified perhaps before their species had evolved its present form it was itchy to think of the tosevites as more advanced in a way than his own people but the logic seemed inescapable he said until i am told otherwise the experiment will continue in its present form even if i am told otherwise i shall not surrender the hatchling to the inept mercies of the big uglies without an appeal to highest authority and i too have backers for my cause this work is an important part of understanding not only our future relations with the tosevites but also that of their sexuality and its consequences for their species terminating it would disrupt several research tracks and probably send you back down to the surface of tosev tessrek said maliciously at least ivebeen down to the surface of tosev ttomalss retorted though he regarded that surface and the big uglies who dwelt on it as rivaling each other for unpleasantness he added some males seem to be of the opinion that research can be conducted only in sterile laboratory settings they do not understand that interactions with the environment are significant and that results obtained in the laboratory are liable to be skewed precisely because the setting is unnatural some males on the other fork of the tongue simply enjoy stepping into lumps of excrement and stooping to wash it out from between their toes tessrek turned his eye turrets toward the tosevite hatchling and some males i might add are in a poor position to sneer at the practices of others when they themselves are comfortably ensconced in a laboratory aboard ship being here is a necessary component of my research ttomalss answered angrily i am trying to determine how well the big uglies can be made to conform to our practices if those are inculcated into them from hatchlinghood just as one intending fraud goes to a computer for access to resources i have brought the hatchling here for access to the race undiluted by contact with the tosevites such would be most difficult to arrange down on the surface of tosev youve certainly given the rest of us undiluted olfactory contact with the wretched little creature tessrek said the scrubbers up here are designed to eliminateour wastes from the air not its and some of those odors have proved most persistent and most disgusting he added an emphatic cough the hatching made a noise that if you were in a charitable mood you might have recognized as an emphatic cough perhaps you didnt need to be in a charitable mood tessreks eyes swung sharply toward the little tosevite then moved away as if to say he refused to acknowledge what hed just heard triumphantly ttomalss said there you see the hatching despite its deficiencies is being socialized toward our usages even at this early stage in its development it was just another in the series of loud unpleasant sounds the creature emits tessrek insisted it held no intelligible meaning whatsoever to show he meant what he said he let out a second emphatic cough now ttomalss looked anxiously toward the hatchling even he would have been willing to concede it did not know the meanings of the noises it made in imitation of his it seemed likely to learn meanings by observing what the beings around it did in response to the stimuli varying sounds evoked but despite his knowledge he would have yielded a pay periods wages to have it come out with another emphatic cough he didnt think it was going to happen but then just when hed given up hope the little tosevite did make a noise that sounded like an emphatic coughsounded more like one in fact that its first effort had coincidence tessrek declared before ttomalss could say a thing yet no matter how dogmatically certain he sounded he did not presume to tack yet a third emphatic cough on behind his assertion i think not ttomalss said this is how the big uglies go about acquiring language since we are the language possessors with whom the hatchling is in constant contact it is imitating our repertoire of sounds eventually i believe it will attach mental signification to the sounds it uses in other words it will begin to speak intelligibly the big uglies have enough trouble doing that no matter what language they use tessrek said but he did not try directly refuting ttomalss from which ttomalss inferred he conceded the point ttomalss said since video and audio monitors constantly record the activities in this chamber i want to thank you for adding to our store of data concerning tosevite language acquisition tessrek hissed something unpleasant and departed more quickly than hed come in ttomalss let his mouth fall open in a long laugh which he thought wellearned the tosevite hatchling emitted one of the squeals it used in place of a sensibly quiet gesture sometimes those squeals so unlike any sound the race made annoyed ttomalss no end now he laughed even harder the hatchling had understood his mirth and responded with its own for the benefit of the recorders he emphasized that point aloud adding this growing level of successful interspecies communication appears to me to warrant further serious investigation he looked at the little tosevite with something more nearly approaching warmth than he ever remembered showing it lets see them try to take you away from me now even if you are a nuisance youre too valuable to give back to the big uglies jens larssen peered out the window of the farmhouse where hed taken shelter for the past several days that was what hed been doing lately peering out the window and waiting for the searchers to give up and go away they arent going to catch me he muttered im too smart for them i wont let them catch me he was pretty sure he could have outrun pursuit from denver and made it to lizardheld territory pursuit wasnt the only problem though people would have been waiting for him out east he hadnt forgotten telegraph and telephone lines even if those were likely to be down could you take the chance and radio and even carrier pigeons theyd know he was coming oh yes they would so hed been waiting for them to give up and quit looking for him sooner or later theyd figure hed got caught in a snowstorm and frozen to death or that hed managed a clean getaway or else the war would heat up and theyd forget all about him and go off to fight then hed start moving again the time he judged was nearly ripe he laughed they arent going to catch me he repeated hell they were right in this house and they didnt have a clue hed been smart he was a physicisthe was supposed to be smart hed picked a house with a storm cellar in it whenever prying eyes came around hed ducked down into the cellar hed even tied a throw rug to a chair near the cellar door so it kept that door covered up after he went down below hed heard combat boots thumping up above his head but none of the soldiers had had a hint that he was sitting in the darkness with his finger on the trigger of his springfield in case anything had gone wrong he laughed again the soldiers hadnt had the brains to look beyond the ends of their noses hed expected nothing different and hed been right i usually am he said if those fools would have listened to me he shook his head they hadnt listened the lizards would even though they hadnt been physicists the people whod built this farm had been pretty smart too they werent around though so they hadnt been smart enough to escape the lizards or maybe they hadnt been lucky enough you never could tell whichever way it was they were gone but theyd left behind that storm cellar stocked with enough homecanned goodies to feed a platoon for a month that was how it seemed to jens anyhow beef pork chicken vegetablesthey didnt seem to have had any fruit trees and he missed sweets till he came upon a gallon jar of tapioca pudding the wife of the house must have made a lot more than she could use right away and put up the rest he ate tapioca till it started coming out of his ears hed found cigarettes down there too but he hadnt smoked any the odor would linger in the house when he got on the road againah that was another matter he looked forward to it although the first couple of times hed lit up after going without for a long time hed been like tom sawyer after huck finn gave him his first pipe he walked over to the window that looked across the fields toward us it was snowing again not so hard as it had back when he was a kid in minnesota but plenty hard enough to cut way back on visibility in a way that was bad because he couldnt tell who if anybody was out there he didnt think anybody was the highway had been quiet since that search party stomped through the house and that was days ago now and the snow could work for him too it would make him harder to spot and harder to recognize if somebody did spot him well then time to get moving he said he was just the denver side of limon once he made it past there hed be getting close to frontier country hed have to be careful again the frontier meant soldiers but unless he had it all wrong theyd be worrying about lizards not about him and he didnt have it all wrong he couldnt have it all wrong the only mistake hed made was not doing something like this a hell of a lot sooner he went down into the storm cellar and hauled out his bicycle as soon as he was on the road he lit up a king sano yeah it made him halfway want to puke but goddamn did it taste good the russies had been buried alive before first in the bunker under a warsaw block of flats and then in the submarine that brought them from poland to england that didnt mean moishe enjoyed repeating the process there were however worse choices these days a sandyhaired naval officer named stansfield commanded the hmsseanymph welcome aboard hed said as somewhere off the coast of portugal or perhaps spain moishe rivka and reuven transferred to his boat from the freighter that had brought them down from england id wager youll be glad to submerge for a spell like a lot of military types moishe had metpoles nazis englishmen lizardshe seemed almost indecently offhanded about the implications of combat maybe the only way he could deal with them was not to think about them moishe had answered yes and let it go at that when the british decided to send him to palestine getting him and his family there hadnt looked like a problem the lizards hadnt acted very interested in attacking ships but then the americans had touched off atomic bombs first in chicago and then in miami when moishe thought of chicago he thought of gangsters hed never heard of miami before it abruptly ceased to be what he thought of those places didnt much matter though the lizards must have thought ships had something to do with their destruction because from then on theyd started hitting them a lot harder than they ever had before moishe didnt know how many times his eyes had flicked to the air on the long rough haul down from england it was he realized a pointless exercise even if he spotted a lizard fighterbomber what could he do about it that didnt keep him from looking anyhow diving with theseanymph had seemed reassuring at first not only was he out of sight of the lizards he was also out of the waves that had made the passage something less than a travelers delight no rolling and pitching down however many meters they were that was just as well too for the submarine was not only cramped but also full of pipes and projecting pieces of metal and the rims of watertight doors all of which could bang heads or shins or shoulders in a proper design moishe thought most of those projections would have been covered over by metal sheeting or hidden away behind walls he wondered why they hadnt been in his halting english he asked commander stansfield the naval officer blinked at the question then answered damned if i know best guess i can give you is that sclass boats are built in such a tearing hurry no one cares about anything past getting them out there to sink ships give us another couple of generations of engineering and the submarines will be much more comfortable to live in compared to what we had in the last war im told this is paradise to russies way of thinking paradise was not to be found in a narrow smelly noisy metal tube lit by dim orange lights so that it resembled nothing so much as a view of the christian hell if this was an improvement he pitied the men who had put to sea in submarines about the time he was born he rivka and reuven shared what normally would have been the executive officers cabin even by the dreadful standards of the warsaw ghetto it would have been cramped for one and was hideously crowded for three when set against the sailors tripledecker bunks though it seemed a luxury flat a blanket attached with wires to one of the overhead pipes gave some small semblance of privacy in yiddish rivka said when we went from poland to england i was afraid to be the only woman on a ship full of sailors now though i dont worry they arent like the nazis they dont take advantage moishe thought about that after a little while he said were on the same side as the english that makes a difference to the nazis we were fair game whats fair game mean reuven asked he remembered the ghetto as a time of hunger and fear but hed been away from it most of a year now in the life of a little boy that was a long time his scars had healed moishe wished his own dreadful memories would go away as readily after being submerged for what he thought was most of a daythough time in tight dark places had a way of slipping away from you if you didnt hold it downtheseanymph surfaced hatches let in fresh air to replace the stale stuff everyone had been breathing over and over again they also let in shafts of sunlight that clove straight through the gloom inside the submarine no winter sun in london or warsaw could have shone so bright well lay over in gibraltar to recharge our batteries and pick up whatever fresh produce they have for us here commander stansfield told moishe then well submerge again and go on into the mediterranean to rendezvous with the vessel that will take you on to palestine he frowned thats what the plan is at any rate the lizards are strong around much of the mediterranean if theyve been as vigorous attacking ships there as elsewhere what do we do then moishe asked stansfield grimaced i dont precisely know i gather your mission is of considerable importance it must be or it wouldnt have been laid on but ive neither fuel nor supplies to take you there im afraid and i dont really know where i should acquire more here possibly though i should have to get authority from london first let us hope it does not come to that yes moishe said let us he and his family stretched their legs on the deck of theseanymph a few times while she resupplied the sun beat down on them with a vigor it seldom found in summer in more northerly climes like those of the sailors their skins were fishbelly pale before long they began to turn pink the germans and italians had bombed gibraltar back when the war was a merely human affair the lizards had bombed it since more persistently and more precisely nonetheless it remained in british hands no great warships used the harbor as they had in earlier days but moishe spotted a couple of other submarines one looked considerably different in lines from theseanymph he wondered if it was even a british boat could the axis powers be using a harbor theyd tried to destroy when the crew dogged the hatches moishe felt a pang as if he were being dragged unwilling into a cave after the spirited mediterranean sun the dim interior lamps seemed particularly distressing a couple of hours later though hed got used to the orange twilight once more time crawled on the sailors were all either asleep or busy keeping the submarine running moishe had slept as much as he could and he was useless on the boat that left him as bored as hed ever been in his life in the bunker under the warsaw ghetto flats hed passed a lot of time making love with rivka he couldnt do that here keeping reuven out of mischief helped occupy him his son was every bit as bored as he was and couldnt understand why he wasnt allowed to go out and get under peoples feet its not fair he said again and again he was probably right but not right enough to be turned loose theseanymph sailed east altogether cut off from the outside world moishe wondered if traveling between worlds in a lizard spaceship was anything like this if it was he pitied the lizards they had to endure it for a lot longer than mere hours when the submarine surfaced it was black night outside that made transferring moishe and his family safer but also harder like trying to find a black cat in a coal cellar at midnight commander stansfield grumbled and were not even certain the cat is here how well can you find where you are going when this ship is underwater russie asked boat stansfield corrected absently that is the rub of course if were a coupleor more than a coupleof miles from where we ought to be we might as well have sailed to colorado he smiled as if at some remembered joke whatever it was it made no sense to moishe stansfield went on its a clear night we can read our positions from the stars and move at need but dawn will be coming before too longnow that were further south night ends earlier than it would in british watersand im not keen on being spotted around here no i understand this moishe said can you sail back to gibraltar all under the sea well use the diesels to charge the batteries the royal navy man answered after a moment russie realized that wasnt a fully responsive reply theseanymph had sailed into danger to take him and his family where they were supposed to go stansfield was getting out the sextant when a sailor came down from the conning tower and said sir weve spotted a ship maybe half a mile to port no sign she knows were anywhere about is that the one we want its not likely to be anybody else stansfield said and if it happens to be he wont go telling tales out of school well make certain of that moishe hadnt heard the idiom before and needed a moment to figure out what it meant yes stansfield was a military manhe talked with complete equanimity of killing people theseanymph glided quietly toward the waiting ship moishe wished he could go up on deck to help but realized he would be as much underfoot there as reuven was down below he hated waiting for others to decide his fate that had happened too often in his life and here it was again shoes clattered on the rungs of the iron ladder that led up to the conning tower captains compliments sir maam a sailor said and please to get your things and come along with me he actually saidfings andwiv but that didnt bother moishe who had trouble with theth sound himself he and rivka grabbed their meager bundles of belongings and shooing reuven ahead of them climbed up to the top of the conning tower moishe peered out into the darkness a tramp steamer bobbed alongside theseanymph even in the darkness even to moishes inexperienced eye it looked old and dingy and battered commander stansfield came over and pointed there she is he said thats thenaxos shell take you the rest of the way to the holy land good luck to you he held out a hand moishe shook it with a rattling of chains thenaxos lowered a boat moishe helped his wife and son into it then put in what theyd brought with them and last of all climbed in himself one of the sailors at the oars said something in a language he didnt understand to his amazement reuven answered in what sounded like the same language the sailor leaned forward in surprise then threw back his head and shouted loud laughter what language are you speaking where did you learn it moishe asked his son in yiddish what do you mean what language reuven answered also in yiddish he uses the same words the stephanopoulos twins did so i used some of those words too i liked playing with them even if they weregoyim to rivka moishe said he learned greek he sounded almost accusing then he started to laugh i wonder if the stephanopoulos boys speak yiddish and surprise their mother they were using some of my words too papa reuven said its all right isnt it he seemed anxious perhaps afraid hed revealed too much to his friends in the ghetto you quickly learned giving yourself away was dangerous its all right moishe assured him its better than all right in fact im proud of you for learning he scratched his head i just hope you wont be the only one who can talk with these sailors when they got up onto thenaxos deck the captain tried several languages with moishe before discovering they had german in common panagiotis mavrogordato thats me he said thumping his chest with a theatrical gesture theyre your enemies theyre my enemies and we have to use their tongue to talk with each other he spat on the deck to show what he thought of that now the lizards are everyones enemies moishe said the greek rubbed his chin dipped his head in agreement and spat again theseanymph slid beneath the surface of the mediterranean that made thenaxos rock slightly in the water otherwise there was no trace the submarine had ever been there moishe felt alone and very helpless hed trusted the british sailors who could say anything about the crew of a rusty greek freighter if they wanted to throw him over the side they could if they wanted to hand him to the first lizards they saw they could do that too as casually as he could he asked where do we go from here mavrogordato started ticking off destinations on his fingers rome athens tarsus haifa at haifa you get off but was mavrogordato trying to bluff him rome is in the lizards hands most of italy is thats why we go there mavrogordato mimed licking something from the palm of his hand the lizards there will be mightygamemeno glad to see us too moishe didnt know whatgamemeno meant reuven let out a shocked gasp and then a giggle which told him what sort of word it was likely to benot that he hadnt figured that out for himself even without the word he understood what the greek was talking about so he was running ginger was he in that case the alienswould be glad to see himand he was less likely to turn over a family of jews to lizard officialdom mavrogordato went on they give us all kinds of interesting things in exchange for thehe made that tasting gesture againwe bring them yes they do we would have had a profitable trip already and when the british paid us to carry you too he bunched his fingertips together and kissed them russie had never seen anybody do that before but he didnt need a dictionary for it either the captain of thenaxos led them to their cabin it had one narrow bed for him and rivka with a pallet on the floor for reuven it was cramped and untidy next to the accommodations aboard theseanymph theyd just left it seemed like a country estate dont turn on the light at night unless you shut the door and pull the blackout curtain over the porthole first mavrogordato said if you make a mistake about that we will be very unhappy with you no matter how much the british paid us for you do you understand without waiting for an answer he squatted and spoke in slow careful greek to reuven nee neereuven saidthats what it sounded like to moishe anyhow his son was obviously impatient at being talked down to and addedmalakas under his breath mavrogordatos eyes went wide he started to laugh getting to his feet in a hurry he said this is a fine boy you have here he will make a fine man if you can keep from strangling him first well have rolls and bad tea for breakfast in a couple of hours when the sun rises come join us then with a last dip of his head he went out of the cabin rivka shut the door and used the blackout curtain then she clicked on the light switch a ceiling bulb in a cage of iron bars lit up the metal cubicle the cage was much like the ones aboard theseanymph the bulb though made moishe squint and his eyes water it wasntit couldnt have beenas bright as gibraltar sunshine but it seemed that way moishe looked around the cabin it didnt take long but for rivets and peeling paint and a couple of streaks of rust there wasnt much to see in his minds eye though he looked farther ahead halfway there he said halfway there rivka echoed mama papa i have to make apish reuven said moishe took his hand come on he said well find out where you do that here ussmak was dressed in more clothes than hed ever worn in his life back on home he hadnt worn anything beyond body paint and belts hung with pouches that was the way you were supposed to go through life but if he went out that door as if he were on home hed freeze to death before he ever got to his landcruiser he turned an eye turret down toward the large heavy gloves on his hands how are we supposed to do any sort of work on the machine in clumsy things like these he complained not for the first time my grip has about as much precision as if i were using my tailstump we have to maintain the landcruiser no matter how hard it is nejas answered the landcruiser commander was bundled up as thoroughly as ussmak it has to be perfect in every wayno speck of dirt no slightest roughness in the engine if the least little thing goes wrong the big uglies will swoop down and kill us before we even know theyre around he paused then added i want a taste of ginger so do i superior sir ussmak said he knew hed probably saved nejas life by giving him ginger when he was wounded in the invasion of britain but ginger fit nejas personality only too well hed been a perfectionist before now the least little flaw sent him into a rage the herb also exaggerated his tendency to worry about everything and anything especially after hed been without it for a while a lot of males in this emperorforsaken frozen soviet wasteland were like that but for going on patrol and servicing their landcruisers they had nothing to do but sit around in the barracks and watch video reports on how the conquest of tosev was going even when couched in broadcasters cheerily optimistic phrases those reports were plenty of incitement for any male in his right mind to worry about anything and everything superior sir will this planet be worth having once the war of conquest is over ussmak asked the way things are going now there wont be much left to conquer ours is not to question those who set strategy ours is to obey and carry out the strategy they set nejas answered like any proper male of the race he was as good a subordinate as a commander maybe it was all the ginger ussmak had tasted maybe all the crewmales hed seen killed maybe just his sense that the races broadcasters hadnt the slightest clue about what the war they were describing was really like whatever it was he didnt feel like a proper male any more he said meaning no disrespect to the fleetlord and those who advise him superior sir but too much of what theyve tried just hasnt worked look what happened to us in britain look at the poisonous gas and the atomic bombs the big uglies are using against us skoob was also climbing into the gear a male needed to survive in siberia the gear that turned quick death into prolonged discomfort the gunner spoke in reproving tones the leaders know better than we what needs doing to finish the conquest of tosev isnt that right superior sir he turned confidently to nejas skoob had come through the british campaign unwounded hed also managed to keep from sticking his tongue in the powdered ginger though he turned his eye turrets the other way when his crewmales tasted but for that toleration though he still seemed as innocent of the wiles of the tosevites as all the males of the race had been when the ships of the conquest fleet first came to tosev in a way ussmak envied him that he himself had changed and change for the race was always unsettling disorienting nejas had changed toonot as much as ussmak but hed changed with a hissing sigh he said gunner sometimes i wonder what is in the fleetlords mind i obeybut i wonder skoob looked at him as if hed betrayed their base to the russkis he sought solace in work well superior sir lets make sure the landcruiser is in proper running order if it lets us down we wont be able to obey our superiors ever again truth nejas said i dont want to quarrel with you or upset you skoob but i dont want to lie to you either youd think i was talking out of a video screen if i tried it he didnt think much of the relentless good news that kept coming from the fighting fronts either then trying to keep the landcruiser operational was a neverending nightmare it would have been a nightmare even had ussmak himself been warm frozen water in all varieties got in between road wheels and tracks and chassis and cemented them to one another the intense cold made some metals brittle it also made lubricants less than enthusiastic about doing their proper job engine wear had been heavy since the landcruiser was airlifted here and spare parts were in constantly short supply as he thawed out the cupola lid so it would open and close ussmak said good thing we have those captured machine tools to make some of our own spares if it werent for that and for cannibalizing our wrecks wed never keep enough machines in action truth skoob said from back at the engine compartment so ussmak thought at any rate the howling wind blew the gunners words away ussmak took tiny cautious sips of air even breathed through several thicknesses of cloth it still burned his lungs little crystals of ice formed on the mask his eyes almost the only exposed part of him kept trying to freeze open he blinked and blinked and blinked fighting to keep them working good enough nejas said some endless time later what we really need is a flamethrower under the chassis of the landcruiser then we could melt the ice that freezes us to the ground in a hurry the crew started back toward the barracks ussmak said ive been talking with some of the males whove been here a long time they say this is bad but local spring is a hundred times worse all the frozen water meltsby the way they make that sound it happens in the course of a day or two but i dont think that can be rightand whatever was on top of the ground sinks down into the mud sometimes if youre lucky you can get it out again you served in the sssr before didnt you nejas said did you see any of that for yourself i saw the mud in local fall before i was hurt ussmak answered that was bad it just comes from rain falling on the ground though from all ive heard the mud that comes in spring when a winters worth of frozen water melts is a lot worse he looked around at the white expanse through which they slogged a lot of the drifts were higher than a male was tall winter had a long way to go too all of tosev s seasons were twice as long as those of home in any case and here in siberia winter seemed to rule most of the local year his sigh turned the air around him smoky softly he said i hope we last long enough to see how bad the local mud is rance auerbach stared out across the snowy eastcolorado prairie he didnt see anything much which suited him fine he wanted to be off fighting the lizards not making like an mp what he wanted and the orders he got werent the same beast he wasnt the only one on whom those orders grated either lieutenant magruder rode up to him and asked who is this guy were supposed to be looking for again waste of time if you ask menot that anybody did fellows name is larssen says colonel nordenskold auerbach laughed one squarehead telling us to go find another one the colonel got word from general groves that this larssen plugged two guys and then headed east they dont want him to make it into lizard country why do they give a damn thats what i want to know and nobodys told me yet magruder said if hes a bastard and hes heading toward the lizards why shouldnt we let him be their headache colonel nordenskold told you just as much as he told me auerbach answered so i dont know either he could make some guesses though hed led the cavalry detachment that had escorted groveswhod been a colonel thenall the way from the east coast to denver he didnt know for certain what groves had carried in that heavy heavy pack of his but he suspected the explosions in chicago and miami hadnt done anything to make him think he was wrong either if groves wanted this larssen stopped it was probably because larssen had something to do with those explosions if he made it through to the lizards who could say what would happen next the likeliest thing auerbach could think of was denver going up in a flash of light if that happened the usas chance to beat the lizards would probably go up with it if if if all of it was guesswork and he knew as much all the same that wasnt why he kept quiet about it the fewer people who knew about heavyduty bombs the less chance word about them had of reaching the lizards other speculations he would have shared with magruder but not these he wished he hadnt been in the position to make these particular guesses himself magruder changed the subject hes going to get past us on abicycle he patted his horses neck the animal whickered softly hes supposed to be good at roughing it auerbach answered maybe hell ditch the bike and try it on foot this is a big country and were spread thin he might slip through hell bill he might already have slipped through and the other thing of it is he might not be within a hundred miles of here no way to know no way to know magruder echoed so here we are out beating the bushes for this one guy instead of doing something to twist the lizards little scaly tails thats a hell of a thing he must be one really important soandso if they want him caught so bad does sound that way auerbach agreed he felt magruders eyes on him but pretended he didnt his lieutenant might not know as much as he did but wasnt bad at piecing things together auerbach peered south from us somewhere a couple of miles down there was the little town of boyero a squad was going through there now the rest of his men were strung out along the dirt road that led from boyero to the highway and north of us toward arriba on us farther north troopers from burlington took over for his company one lone man shouldnt have been able to slip through that net but as hed told magruder it was a big country and they were spread thin one thing magruder said perhaps trying to look on the bright side its not like hes going to be able to fool us by making like hes somebody else theres nobody else on the road to pretend to be youre right about that auerbach said country like this there wouldnt have been a lot going on even before the lizards came now theres nothing behind heavy clouds the sun slid toward the distantand now obscuredrockies auerbach wondered if larssen had the guts to move at night he wouldnt have wanted to try it not on a bicycle maybe on foot but while that upped your chances of slipping through it also slowed your travel and left you running the risk of being far from cover when day found you a rider came pounding down the dirt road toward us auerbach spotted blond hair around the edges of the helmet and nodded to himselfrachel hines was the most recognizable trooper in his command she reined in saluted and said sir smitty and me we think we seen somebody heading our way across the fields but as soon as whoever it was spotted us he went to ground he couldnt hardly think we were lizards so so he must have thought we were looking for him auerbach finished excitement tingled through him he hadnt expected to run across larssen but now that he had he was ready to run him down im with you he said well pick up every other soldier on the way to where you and smitty were atthat way in case this turns out not to be larssen we wont give him a free road east he turned to magruder bill you stay here and ride herd on things if we run into trouble send more men after us yes sir magruder said resignedly why did i know you were going to tell me that because youre smart come on rachel with knees and reins he urged his horse up into a fast trot rachel hines had galloped to give him the news but stayed with him now every few hundred yards theyd gather up another trooper by the time they got back to where smitty was waiting they headed up a squads worth of men were gonna get the guy eh captain rachel said auerbach heard something of the eagerness he felt in her voice dont quite know why we want him but were gonna get him yeah reckon we are auerbach heard the question in rachels voice but if he wouldnt give out his guesses for magruder he wouldnt do it for her either he turned to the troopers hed brought in his wake isbell you and evers hold horses if we get in trouble out there one of you ride like hell back to the highway and tell lieutenant magruder to get reinforcements up here the men hed designated both nodded he peered out over the prairie he saw no signs anybody was out there but larssen was supposed to know what he was doing okay lets spread out and get him be on your toes hes got a gun and he uses it before she separated from the rest rachel hines said thanks for not making me stay back with the critters captain auerbach realized he hadnt even thought of that hed accepted her as a soldier like any other he shook his head would he have imagined such a thing before the war never in a million years he strode across the chilly ground these had probably been wheatfields before the lizards came but they didnt look to have been harvested the last couple of years even after the winter dieoff a lot of the brush was waist high bushes had taken root here and there among the grain too the country looked pretty flat but it gave better cover than youd think the grain and bushes also broke up the snow on the ground making it harder to spot somebodys tracks if larssen was smart hed just sit tight wherever he was and hope theyd miss himif he was really here but being that smart wasnt easyand if auerbach turned the whole company loose on this stretch of ground anybody hiding would get found he didnt want to do that in case he was wrong pulling in a raft of men would leave a hole in the screen the army had set up to keep the fugitive from slipping east larssen auerbach shouted come out with your hands up and nobodyll get hurt make it easy on yourselfmake it easy on us too larssen didnt come out auerbach hadnt expected that he would he took another couple of steps toward where rachel and smitty had seen whoever it was take cover a bullet cracked past his ear an instant later he heard the sound of the gunshot he was already throwing himself flat down he yelled from behind a tumbleweed he looked around but dead plants didnt let him see far he shouted orders spread out to right and left and take him now they knew where larssen was getting him out wouldnt be any fun but it was something they knew how to do tactics that came almost as automatically as breathing larssen fired again not at auerbach this time youre all against me he shouted his voice thin in the distance i paid back two ill pay back the rest of you sons of bitches if its the last thing i ever do out on either flank a couple of auerbachs troopers started shooting at larssen not necessarily to hit him but to make him keep his head down while their buddies slid forward not far from auerbach rachel hines fired a couple of shots that was his cue to dash ahead and then flop down in back of another bush he squeezed off three rounds from his own ml and heard rachel and a couple of other troopers advancing on either side of him if you were being moved in on from the front and both flanks the way larssen was you had only two choices both bad you could stay where you wereand get nailedor you could try and runand get nailed larssen sat tight a cry from off to auerbachs left said hed hit somebody auerbach bit his lip casualties came with the job he understood that when you went up against the lizards you expected not to come back with a full complement and hoped youd do them enough damage to make up for your own losses but having somebody woundedauerbach hoped the trooper was just woundedhunting down one guy whod gone off the deep end that was a waste nothing else but he was within a hundred yards of larssen now and could hear him even when he was talking to himself something about his wife and a ballplayerauerbach couldnt quite make out what he fired again rachel hines scurried past him larssen rose up shot flopped back down rachel let out a short sharp shriek larssen bounced to his feet barbara he shouted honey auerbach fired at him several other shots rang out at the same instant larssen reeled backwards collapsed bonelessly his rifle fell to the ground he wasnt going anywhere not any time soon auerbach ran up to rachel hines she already had a wound dressing out and was wrapping it around her hand she looked up at auerbach clipped the last two joints right off my ring finger she said matteroffactly dont know what ill do about a wedding band if i ever get married youll figure out something auerbach bent down and kissed her on the cheek hed never done that for a wounded noncom before seeing that she wasnt seriously injured he said im going to make sure of the son of a gun now i think maybe hearing you yell like that startled him into breaking cover its not like i done it on purpose she answered but she was talking to his back jens larssen was still twitching when auerbach got up to him but he didnt see any point in calling for a corpsman larssen had taken one in the chest one in the belly and one in the side of the face he wasnt pretty and he was dead only his body didnt quite know it yet as auerbach stood over him he let out a bubbling sigh and quit breathing well thats that auerbach said bending to pick up larssens springfieldno point in leaving a good weapon out to rust now we can get on with the important stuff like fighting the war thenaxos chugged on toward rome it flew a large redwhiteandblue tricolor captain mavrogordato had hauled out of the flag locker i want the lizards airplanes to think we are french he explained to moishe we have friends on the ground in rome who know we are bringing them good things but the pilotswho can say what they know since the lizards hold southern france this will help them believe we are perfectly safe what happens when we leave rome and head for athens and tarsus and haifa moishe asked those places they wont be so happy to see a ship that might have come out of lizardheld country mavrogordato shrugged we have plenty of flags in the locker when the time comes we will pick another one that better suits our business there all right russie said why not hed never known such a blithe swashbuckler before mavrogordato was smuggling things to the lizards undoubtedly smuggling things away from them and was smuggling him and his family right past their scaly snouts for all the greek captain worried about itairplanes asidehe might have had the whole mediterranean to himself but what if something goes wrong moishe had asked him some hundreds of kilometers back toward the west he himself was a chronic worrier and was also of the opinion that considering everything that had happened to him over the past few years hed earned the right but mavrogordato had shrugged then too if something goes wrong ill deal with it hed answered and that was all he would say moishe reluctantly concluded he didnt say any more because he didnt know any more moishe would have had plans upon plans upon plans each one ready in case the trouble that matched it arrived whether the plans would have worked was another question given his track record it wasnt obvious but he would have had them how far from rome are we now he asked as the italian countryside crawled past beyond the starboard rail thirtyfive kilometers maybe a bit less mavrogordato answered well be there in a couple of hoursin time for lunch he laughed moishes stomach rumbled in anticipation neither the british freighter that had brought him down near spain nor theseanymph had had a galley that could compare to thenaxos mavrogordatos crew might have been short on shaves and clean clothes and other evidence of spit and polish but they lived better than british seamen imagined russie wondered if the english had some sort of requirement denying them as much pleasure as possible or maybe they were just a nation of bad cooks i hate to say it but i wish the germans were in italy instead of the lizards moishe said it gives them too good a base for pushing north or east they tried pushing east into croatia last year and got their snouts bloodied for them mavrogordato said but youre right anybody who looks at a map can tell you as much hold italy down and youre halfway toward holding down the whole mediterranean mussolini didnt have much luck with the whole mediterranean moishe said but we cant count on the lizards being as incompetent as he was captain mavrogordato slapped him on the back hard enough to stagger him he spoke a couple of sentences in greek before he remembered russie didnt know what he was talking about and shifted back to german we kicked the italians right out of our country when they invaded us the nazis beat us yes but not those clowns the difference between the italians and the germans was that between inept tyrants and effective ones inept tyrants roused only contempt no one was contemptuous of the germans the russians or the lizards you could hate them but you had to fear them too moishe said ginger is the worst weakness the lizards have i think a lizard who gets a taste for ginger will he broke off a flash of light from the north distracting him he wondered what it could beit was as bright as the sun and no it wasnt just a flashit went from white to orange to red a fireball swelling fantastically with each moment he stood there watching meter theoupanagiotis mavrogordato exclaimed and crossed himself the gesture didnt bother russie he wished he had one to match it the captain of thenaxos went on did they hit an oil tanker between us and rome youd think we would have heard the airplanes or something they did hear something just then a roar that rocked moishe harder than mavrogordatos slap on the back had a few minutes earlier a great column of smoke shot through with crimson flames rose into the air moishe craned his neck to watch it climb slowly softly he said i dont think that was anything between us and rome captain i think thatwas rome for a moment the greek stared at him blank incomprehension on his face then mavrogordato crossed himself again more violently than he had before is it one of those terrible bombs he demanded in a hoarse whisper i dont know moishe said ive never seen one before but i dont know what else it could be either only the one blast andthat he nodded toward the glowing growing cloud of dust and fire if god is kind ill never see such a thing again captain mavrogordato pointed out over the water a large wave was approaching thenaxos at unnatural speed as if flying through the air rather than being part of the sea the freighters bow rose sharply then plunged into the trough behind the wave sped past them out toward corsica and sardinia and sicily moishe wondered if it would wash up against distant gibraltar mavrogordato shouted orders in greek thenaxos engine began to work harder the deck thrummed under moishes feet and thick clouds of black smoke rose from the stack those clouds though were misshapen dwarfs when set alongside the one still swelling above rome moishe could not tear his eyes away from that terrible beauty he wondered how many peopleand how many lizardshad perished in the blast there goes the pope mavrogordato said one step ahead of him im no catholic but thats a hell of a thing to do to him how the poles would wail when the news reached them and if they could find a way theyd blame it on the jews this time though the lizards and the nazis looked to be much more likely candidates now too the jews had guns moishe wondered briefly bow mordechai anielewicz fared these days if the poles started trouble theyd get trouble back the bow of thenaxos began swinging away from what had been its destination russie glanced toward mavrogordato a question in his eyes the merchant captain said nobodys going to take delivery of what we were bringing not here not now i want to get as far away as i can as fast as i can if the lizards were hunting ships before what will they do after this gevaltmoishe said he hadnt thought of that maybe the greek had heard that bit of yiddish before or maybe tone and context let him figure out what it meant he said itll be better once we get away from italy lizard planes dont range quite so widely in the eastern half of the mediterranean as they do here only trouble is im going to have to coal once before we make athens i would have done it at rome but now will they let you go into an italian port after this moishe asked only one way to find out mavrogordato answered and thats to try it i know some peopleand some lizardsin naples i could unload the ginger theretheou thelontos and take on the fuel i need to get you to where youre going all we have to worry about is getting sunk before we make it that far well friend did you want life to be dull what difference does it make moishe said life hasnt cared what i want ever since the war started after a moments thought the greek solemnly nodded like all the other landcruiser drivers at the siberian base ussmak had installed grids of electrically heated wire over his vision slits they melted the frozen water that accumulated on the slits and let him see what he was doing nejas had mounted similar grids over the panoramic periscopes in the cupola the local mechanics had slapped white paint on the landcruiser too to make it less visible as it ranged across the icy landscape ussmak let his mouth fall slightly open in a bitter laugh making the landcruiser less visible was a long way from making it invisible the big uglies might not realize it was there quite so soon as they would have otherwise but theyd get the idea too quickly to suit him any which way steer a couple of hundredths closer to due south driver nejas said it shall be done ussmak adjusted his course along with two others his landcruiser was rumbling down to smash a soviet convoy trying to cross from one end of the break in their railroad to the other the russkis had probably hoped to get away with it while camouflaged by the usual siberian blizzards but a spell of good weather had betrayed them now they would pay clear weatherussmak corrected himselfnot goodweather from what the males unlucky enough to be longtimers at the base said good weather in siberia was measured in moments each long tosevite year lets slaughter them and get back to the barracks ussmak said the faster we do that the happier ill be he was warm enough inside the landcruiser but the machine was buttoned up at the moment too if the action got heavy nejas good landcruiser commander that he was would open up the cupola and look aroundand all that lovely heat would get sucked right out all the crewmales had on their coldweather gear in case of that dreadful eventuality whamussmak felt as if hed been kicked in the side of the head the round from the soviet landcruiser hadnt penetrated the side armor of his own machine but it did make the inside of the landcruiser ring like a bell turn toward it nejas shouted flipping the cupola lid ussmak was already steering his landcruiser to the leftyou wanted to meet enemy fire head on to present your thickest armor to the gun he knew theyd been lucky soviet landcruiser cannon could pierce some spots in the side armor he peered through his defrosted vision slits it was already getting cold inside the landcruiser where among the dark snowdraped trees and drifts of frozen water was the enemy lurking he couldnt spot the big uglies not till they fired again this time the round hit one of the other landcruisers but did no damage ussmak saw front nejas sang out identified skoob answered but instead of smoothly going on with the targetidentifying routine nejas made a strange wet noise superior sir skoob cried and then in anguish sniper a sniper killed the commander no ussmak whispered votal his first landcruiser commander had died that way a good commander kept standing up in the cupola which let him see much more than he could through periscopes and made his landcruiser a far more effective fighting machinebut which also left him vulnerable to smallarms fire he could have ignored if hed stayed snug inside the turret as if the snow and ice themselves had come to malignant life a figure all clad in white stood up not far from the landcruiser and ran toward it bandit ussmak shouted to skoob and snatched for his personal weapon skoob fired but by then the camouflaged big ugly was too close to the landcruiser for its turretmounted machine gun to bear on him he tossed a grenade up and through the open cupola it exploded inside the turret ussmak thought he was dead fragments of the grenade ricocheted off the inside of the fighting compartment one scraped his side another tore a long shallow cut across his right forearm only as he felt those small wounds did he realize the grenade somehow hadnt touched off the ammunition inside the turret if it had he never would have had the chance to worry about cuts and scrapes he shoved the muzzle of his personal weapon out through a firing port and sprayed the big ugly with bullets before he could chuck another grenade into the landcruiser skoob was screaming terrible cries that grated on ussmaks hearing diaphragms he couldnt help the gunner not yet first he had to get away from the fighting with one male in the turret dead and the other disabled the landcruiser was no longer a fighting machine ussmak could operate the gun or he could drive the vehicle he couldnt do both at once he put it into reverse moving away from the soviet landcruisers in the forest the audio button taped to a hearing diaphragm yelled at him what are you doing the cry came from the male who commanded one of the other landcruisers have your brains addled no superior sir ussmak said though he wished for ginger to make the answer yes in three or four short sentences he explained what had happened to his landcruiser and its crew oh the other commander said when he was through yes you have permission to withdraw good luck return to base get your gunner to treatment as soon as possible it shall be done ussmak said above skoobs wails and hisses he would have withdrawn with or without orders had the other commander tried ordering him to stay he might have gone up into the turret and put a round through his landcruiser keeping a crewmale alive counted for more than killing big uglies you could do that any time if your crewmale died youd never get him back when hed withdrawn far enough from the fighting or so he hoped with all his spirit he stopped the landcruiser and scrambled back to do what he could for skoob by then the gunner had fallen silent his blood and nejas had puddled on the floor of the fighting compartment with the cupola still openno one had been left to close itthe puddles were starting to freeze as soon as he saw the wounds skoob bore ussmak despaired of saving him he bandaged the gunner all the same and dragged him down beside the drivers seat then he scrambled past nejas corpse and slammed the lid of the cupola that gave the landcruisers heater some chance against the stunning siberian winter skoob would need every bit of help he could get ussmak radioed back to the base to alert them that he was coming the male who took the call sounded abstracted as if he had other things on his mind things he reckoned more important ussmak switched off the radio and called him every vile name he could think of he took a large taste of ginger he wasnt in combat now and decided he could use the quickened reflexes the herb gave him without endangering himself or the landcruiser he tried to get skoob to taste ginger but the gunner was too far gone to extend his tongue when ussmak opened skoobs jaws to pour in the stimulant powder he realized the gunner wasnt breathing any more ussmak laid a hearing diaphragm over the gunners chest cavity he heard nothing some time in the last little while skoob had quietly died the ginger kept ussmak from feeling the grief that would otherwise have crushed him what filled him instead was ragerage at the big uglies rage at the cold rage at the base commandant for sending males out to fight in these impossible conditions rage at the race for establishing a base in siberia and for coming to tosev in the first place as the base drew near he tasted again his rage got hotter he halted the landcruiser close by the anticold airlock the crew of mechanics started to protest what if everybody wanted to park his machine there one of them said what if every landcruiser came back with two crewmales dead ussmak snarled most of the mechanics fell back from his fury when one started to argue further ussmak pointed his personal weapon at him the male fled hissing in fright still carrying the weapon ussmak went into the barracks he looked down at himself as he waited for the inner door to open the blood of nejas and skoob still covered the front of his protective garments several males inside exclaimed in startled dismay when he came into the communal chamber more though were watching a televisor screen one of them turned an eye turret toward ussmak the big uglies just hatched another atomic egg he said fueled by his rage and lossand by the gingerussmak shouted we never should have come to this stinking world in the first place now that were here we ought to quit wasting lives fighting the big uglies and figure out how to go home some of the males stared at him others turned their eye turrets away as if to say he didnt even deserve to be stared at somebody said we have been ordered to bring tosev under the rule of the emperor and it shall be done truth a couple of males said agreeing with the fellow but others shouted truth in a different tone of voice ussmak is right one of them added what have we got from tosev but death and misery that brought another louder chorus of truth from the males whod supported ussmak in the first place and from a few who hadnt a lot of his backers he saw were males who had their tongues deep in the ginger vial not all though not by any means that made him feel good even full of ginger he knew males full of ginger were not similarly full of good sense we want to go home he yelled as loud as he could and then again we want to gohome more and more males added their voices to the cry it filled the communal chamber and echoed through the base having the other males follow his lead lifted ussmaks spirits almost the way ginger did this had to be what the fleetlord knew or even the emperor himself a few males who refused to join the outpouring of anger fled the chamber but more came rushing in first to see what the commotion was about and then more often than not to join it we want to gohome ussmaks hearing diaphragms throbbed with the rhythmically repeated roar attention all males attention all males a countering shout rose from the intercom speaker on the wall end this unseemly display at once and return to your duties i hisslef base commandant so order return to your duties at once i say one or two males meekly squeaked it shall be done and skittered away with ginger still in him though ussmak wasnt so inclined to pay the strict attention to subordination he would have when he first came to tosev no he shouted a lot of males in the command chamber were tasting ginger no they yelled with him somebody added fancy body paints not enough in a moment that became a new war cry had hisslef let the males shout and carry on till ginger exhilaration gave way to afterginger gloom the uprising probably would have died a natural death instead he chose to stalk into the communal chamber and shout who has perpetrated this outrageous conduct i have sup ussmak said hed automatically started to add hisslefs honorific but choked it down what honor did hisslef deserve fancy body paintwasnt enough you will place yourself under arrest hisslef said coldly you are a disgrace to the race and shall be punished as you deserve no ussmak answered half the males in the communal chamber stared at him in astonishment disobeying an intercom speaker was one thing disobeying a direct personal order quite another but the repeated loss of cherished crewmalesand the ginger in himtook ussmak to a place far outside the races normal patterns and when he went to that place he was able to take the rest of the males in the chamber with him after their moment of surprise they screamed abuse at hisslef the base commandant spread his hands so all the claws showed a gesture showing he was ready to fight you will come with menow you eggaddled wretch he ground out and took two steps toward ussmak ussmak raised the personal weapon hed been holding ever since he frightened the mechanics with it a gingerquickened impulse made him squeeze the trigger the burst crumpled hisslef and flung him backwards like a sheet of wastepaper ussmak was amazed at how little he cared with nejas blood and skoobs on his coat what did having hisslefs on his hands matter well clean them all out he shouted the base is ours again hed stunned the males in the communal chamber again he was able to take them with him to a place where they might never have gone otherwise clean them out they bayed the base is ours atvar wished with all his spirit that the race had never come to tosev he wished that if the race had to have come to tosev it would have done so under a different fleetlord by the emperor maybe strahashould have overthrown me after the first atomic bomb the big uglies touched off he said savagely id like to see how hed enjoy coping with these latest ones the loss of rome was a heavy one for us in many ways exalted fleetlord kirel agreed not only were military and administrative casualties heavy the bomb also destroyed the big ugly who called himself th pope pius and that male had been a leading factor in accommodating the large number of tosevites of his theological persuasion to our rule his traditional authority reached back almost two thousand tosevite years which for this planet gives most antique status unlike a good many others on this world he was able to recognize the advantages of cooperating with authority atvar answered and he would not have lost all his power after the conquest as the emperors and notemperors here so bitterly fear as you say shiplord an unfortunate big ugly to lose targeting the deutsch city called hamburg for retaliation seems fitting exalted fleetlord kirel said it being a center for waterborne commerce yes we shall destroy it in factatvar flicked one eye toward a chronometerit is already destroyed thus we avenge ourselves for rome thus we visit horror on deutschland in exchange for the horror the deutsche visited upon us he sighed wearily and for what the deutsche continue to resist us this latest bomb had nuclear materials entirely of their own making and much of the radiation from our nuclear explosions on deutsch territoryand from that of their first weapon the one east of breslauis blown east and contaminates our holdings and our males in poland it contaminates the deutsche first and worse exalted fleetlord kirel said atvar hissed out a sad sigh truth and i thank you for trying to cheer me with it but another truth is that the deutsche whether out of sheer ignorance or simply their own savagerygiven some of their practices before we arrived the latter strikes me as not at all unlikelywell as i say whatever the reason may be the deutsche do not seem to care what happens to their own males and females what happens in the generations to come will make them care kirel said truth again atvar answered and if you put this truth to the deutsch notemperorthefuhrer he calls himselfi know precisely what he would say so what if something suffices for the moment the big uglies care nothing for longterm consequences this irony bites us again and again kirel said we must have a care for the future management of tosev in order to preserve it more or less intact for the settlers aboard the colonization fleet while those native to the planet would cheerfully fling it into the cremator for the sake of a temporary advantage pshings face appeared on the communicator screen exalted fleetlord excuse the interruption atvars adjutant said but per your orders i report the successful destruction by atomic weapon of the deutsch city of hamburg all aircraft involved in the mission have returned safely to base thank you the fleetlord said and pshings image vanished atvar turned his eye turrets back toward kirel the war has grown unpredictable no stronger curse could have come from a male of the race deutschland and the united states both continue to produce atomic weapons the sssr may yet succeed in building one of its own all the tosevite powers now use poisonous gases of various sorts against us the deutsche have joined them to missiles how long will it be before they or some other empires or notempires develop missiles whose guidance systems are more accurate than the crude ones they use or until they make missiles large enough or nuclear weapons small enough to use together those are major technological steps exalted fleetlord kirel said they would require many decades perhaps many centuries for us atvar broke in for the big uglies who can say who can say shiplord the more contact we have with the tosevites the more demoralized our males become where will it end what is happening to us here exalted fleetlord i think before kirel could say what he thought he was interrupted again not by atvar this time but by pshing whose features came back on the communicator screen like kirel he began exalted fleetlord atvar knew a sinking feeling this was not an ordered call which meant it had to be an emergency speak he said dreading what his adjutant would say exalted fleetlord now pshing hesitated on his own searching no doubt for the least appalling way to frame whatever the latest disaster was at last he went on exalted fleetlord we have reports a landcruiser and infantry base in the region of the sssr known as siberia no longer ah respond to orders it has fallen to the big uglies atvar asked pshing hesitated again longer this time exalted fleetlord it would appear not the fragmentary communications we had before it stopped responding or transmitting suggest internal disorders instead the base commandant hisslef is believed slain the adjutant hissed in anguished dismay exalted fleetlord it appears to be aa mutiny he hissed again once the awful word was out a mutiny atvar stared at the communicator screen he was too shocked even to be angry that might come later but not yet males of the raceloyal obedient cohesiverising up against their commanderskilling their commanders if the report pshing had was correct it could never have happened not on any world under the emperors dominion on tosev as he had to kirel atvar cried what is happening to us here his voice came out a frightened moan harry
