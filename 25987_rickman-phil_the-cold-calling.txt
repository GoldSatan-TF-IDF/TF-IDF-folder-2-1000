phil rickman the cold calling prologue sacrifice should not be equated with our modern attitude to murder aubrey burl rites of the gods i he is invisible in the greenery the green man the very oldest guardian of the earth whose face one sees carved in stone above church doorways his hair luxuriant with leaves the leaves bearing fruit stone nuts and stone berries more leaves sprouting whole from the grinning mouth foliage gripped between stone teeth the grin that says i am the earth the green man who stands or crouches or squats for the old energy which once sprang from hill to holy hilltop across a shimmering land a force which could make the fields breathe visibly and bring the oldest and coldest of stones to squirming life and stop listen watch this day the green man our green man knows he is perceptible only as foliage roots and branches fungi and moss he is of the earth utterly utterly still he listens to the earth his mother his sister his wife her heart beating faster and fainter nowadays most people have never heard it will not leave their cars to walk on anything more responsive than tarmac or concrete and these people even they who consider themselves defenders of the land and her creatures are unaware of the green man as they slouch in the clearing filling their senses with cigarette smoke plotting hear what he said the bearded man in the khaki anorak unknowingly crosses the energy line as he speaks when they come out the pub this coloneltype guy says oh they wont show up today jeremy its raining no fun in the rain haw haw arrogant bastard they think we got no staying power be a lovely surprise for them the female she is about thirty could be quite pretty if she let her hair grow took a few of the rings out of her nose the rings imply some tribal affiliation what utter nonsense these people have no ethnic roots they are outcasts the other two are shavenhaired teenage boys possibly twins they grin a lot and kick mindlessly at the earth kick at her the green man hopes that one of these boys will be separated from the others and will cross the line alone at an opportune time as that first rabbit did and the squirrels and the fox and once at night a badger whump speeding down the line the earth swelling with the energy of blood ok the bearded man says heres how it works ill go to the top of the mound and when i see them leave the road ill wave both hands like this yeah so you keep an eye on that mound cause im not gonna get the chance to do it twice without one of em sees me so when i wave maria if you can count to thirty then give a little toot from the pocket of her waterproof jacket the female pulls a hunting horn and shakes it hope it bloody works this time she gives a smokers snort of laughter well dont fucking try it now all right shaun if you and gary go down the dingle now and open the metal gate idea is the houndsll come tearing this way and when theyre through the gate you shut it bloody fast and piss off quick cause theyll know whats happening by then and theyll be bloody mad enough to do you an injury see em try one of the boys mutters mutinously you wont youll disappear soon as that gates shut were not here for aggro this is about saving life listen to them mindless disconnected vermin the badger was worth more at least the badger knew the rules they think that by breaking the natural cycle they are saving life they want to sit in their eleventhfloor flats watching the foxes and badgers scamper innocently on the neat square lawns but foxes kill badgers kill the earth kills and so life goes on the faint spark of life that flits from the small body is drawn back into the greater organism bloodfed the earth breathes more deeply and she feeds us because you see once we all killed isnt it obvious it is as natural as eating and sleeping and as important it invigorates and enhances us it renews us and hunting the very act of hunting all the senses streamlined focused combined into a single electric impulse in hunting we are more aware more open to revelation was not john aubrey out hunting when in he realized the significance of the great stones of avebury and even as the green man is thinking this there comes through the trees the distant baying of the hounds a sound as natural and joyous as birdsong but of course more focused hounds hunting in packs hounds and horses and men a tight and yet gloriously ragged combination a stream of pure concerted energy as old as england older a communion pure instinct fusion the wild sound of the horn on the wind the primeval bellow tally ho the ecstatic blooding after ones first hunt licking it off swallowing it so much sweeter than human sex theyre away the female says right the bearded man throws down his cigarette lets do it he grins sab sab sab closing his eyes the green man hears the man and the youths stumbling gracelessly between the trees the swelling heart of the wood an entity in itself pounds loudly in his ears only the female is left in the clearing with the green man and the earth he feels her pulsing with anticipation against his groin stiffening him stiffening his resolve it isnt a major step just a question of breaking a small social convention ideally it should be the man as he stands upon the mound motte it says on the ordnance survey map signifying an artificial mound where a norman castle once stood in fact many of these castles were built on the socalled burial mounds created as far back as the bronze age when all men hunted and were instinctively aware of the needs of the earth and the subtle patterns of her energies the female lights another cigarette it is raining steadily and strands of her short hair are gummed to her face she waits smoking when then watch listen to the earth he wishes there was some way she could speak directly to him make her wishes known the old shamans would go into trance make their requests and receive their instructions he doesnt have their skills not yet one day it will all be given to him in the meantime he must rely on signs and signals the female has taken out the hunting horn suddenly she disgusts him with her sexless shorn hair the rings in her nose her apathy her negativity her hatred and contempt for the upholders of tradition she moves forward to see the mound through the misty rain and she steps into the line which he can see clearly now falling straight as a sunbeam having travelled half a mile from st agness well and crossing another track leading to salisbury cathedral the green man rises slowly to his feet parting the bushes the sounds he makes are small might be the bustling of nesting birds and just as the female guides the false horn to her lips she sees him in his glory lowers the horn who the hell are you oh he says dismissively that doesnt matter at all to you its what i represent that matters what you sabbing too theres uncertainty in her eyes sabbing watch my lips are you a hunt saboteur he is silent for a moment then he says disappointed you wouldnt understand would you im afraid im wasting time we did say onethirty at the pub if you arent organized about this youll get nowhere he makes no reply you really stupid or what he hefts the crossbow to his shoulder her eyes widen shit the female whispers oh god emotion energy at last what can he see in her eyes fear perhaps he sees that shes just a girl you better bugger off ive got mates over there her tone is bitter but her rainbubbled skin is soft and fresh and there glows within her a kind of desire a response from the underlayer of her consciousness and this layer exists in all of us which moves and bends to the rhythm of nature she just doesnt know of it dont be stupid her face muscles struggle for a contemptuous smile those things should be bloody banned says the surface part of her bravely but there are hairline cracks in her voice for contempt swiftly withers in a moment such as this and respect arises the green man laughs brace yourself he says encouragingly let your spirit be released fly with it dont look back your energy will be redeemed she isnt listening he sees a fever boiling in her eyes which flick frantically from side to side as she thrusts the hunting horn between her lips he shoots her then with great calm great precision through the throat the spontaneous surge of pure energy is utterly magnificent and brings him to his knees and then to his face on the forest floor his heart is full his head afloat on golden light the forest around him brilliantly lit as the female also falls to her knees as though in prayer her fingers at her throat the blood jetting down her wrists and into the sleeves of her waterproof coat her attempt at a scream turning to gurgling liquid her eyes at last showing love the earthspirit in her has fallen in love with the bearer of such a fine death her hands reach for him small white fingers imploring she cannot turn her head to follow him as he moves around her fitting another bolt into the bow before shooting her decently he thinks in the back of the neck and prodding her with a foot between the shoulder blades so that she topples forward and gives up her blood at last to the earth shivering with energy now head filling with white light he summons her newly released spirit imagining her shade beside him free now liberated from its bitterness and constriction its feeble pity for the hunted fox fulfilled now appreciative of her small role in the great rehabilitation raising his arms to welcome the rain dripping from his body to the earth he knows he has never felt so utterly alive an almost blinding joy fills him as he raises the females horn to his lips tasting the rain and the blood on the mouthpiece and blows a long euphoric blast and falls to his knees laughing but he dare not stop and he dismantles the crossbow as he glides slippery as an elf through the slick greenery he will drive fifteen miles to bury the bow in a badgers sett at the base of a tumulus called alfreds grave and then climb to the top of the tumulus and stand beneath a broken pine shedding his shirt and lifting his arms to the rain feeling the glory having broken the convention and wasnt it easy ii look at you said kelvyn coming apart you are your jawlines gone your cheeks are caving in cindy peered in the mirror the blasted bird wasnt entirely wrong as for your legs kelvyn cackled well no wonder you have to wear black stockings itll be bloody surgical stockings before long you mark my words lovely you mark my words shut it cindy

publicity is humiliating come on off we go back to the digs with no ceremony but perhaps the dregs of affection cindy dumped kelvyn in his imitationcrocodile suitcase the bird still rambling on in his muffled way as cindy lugged the case to the dressing room door dont know why we cant get decent digs any more i remember i do when we had a threeroom suite in oh cindy said good evening ladies the two cleaners giggled margot and sarah been outside the door listening for a good five minutes cindy gave them a free show after the matinee every friday on a long summer season it was important for your

bear thinking about she was a difficult enough girl heaven knows but nobody on this earth deserves that nobody dear god by the time he reached the bella vista guesthouse cindy had read the echo story twice maria capaldi maria maria it was who had first called him cindy when she was quite small and couldnt get her lips around sydney uncle cindy the echo had a photograph of her from the days before shed had her hair cut short before the noserings the photo from mrs capaldis mantelpiece taken on the girls eighteenth birthday when she was due to go to university from which she would drop out a year later mrs capaldi would have handed it willingly to the press a beautiful memorial the last picture of an unsullied unembittered maria cindy had bewildered tears in his eyes as he turned the corner and saw as if the report needed confirmation a police car outside bella vista and another car behind it both on the double yellows the vacancies sign had been replaced by an ominously crooked no vacancies the little square lobby was deserted the picture postcards hanging limply from their rack alongside the pink and blue poster announcing kelvyn kite with cindy mars with a picture of both of them wearing mocking smiles im sorry sir its closed a policewoman had pushed through the bead curtain i er im staying here what name is it marslewis sydney marslewis the policewoman vanished into the chinking curtain when she came back she said sorry mr lewis but you might have been a reporter lowered her voice know whats happened do you cindy nodded as there came a wail from within let im in let im in the policewoman shrugged and held back the beads for him and cindy went through into the artificial darkness and the real despair the curtains were drawn tight in the residents lounge a table lamp shone under a picture of jesus mrs capaldi was a tiny creature in a corner of the fourseater sofa a teacup shivered in its saucer on her aproned knees her greying black hair was in stiff peaks fresh makeup plastered over tearstains cindy she held out both hands like a drowning woman and cindy took one kneeling on the carpet at the side of the sofa what i do what i ever do to anybody to deserve this appen to me all the times hed heard her ask this about maria alive mr lewis a youngish man with thinning hair arose from a deep armchair peter hatch detective chief inspector i er brought my children to see your show a couple of years ago very er cindy moved to shake hands but mrs capaldi held on to him the detective nodded smiled briefly sat down again he spoke quietly you have much to do with maria mr lewis less lately than at one time cindy said although we did have our discussions about blood sports which both of us deplored so you knew what she was doing in that wood shamed me into going with them once she did oh god cried mrs capaldi oh cindy why couldnt it be you with her today instead of that stupid martin alas cindy explained to the detective always been a little queasy about open confrontation i have maria was braver than me he sighed poor dab poor dab have you you know were talking to a few people dci hatch said i dont anticipate a long investigation what im trying to find out from mrs capaldi is if it was well known that maria was a hunt saboteur if shed ever received any personal abuse or threats as a result an i say to im even if she ad a threat to kill er the last person she ever tell about it is er own mother cindy squeezed mrs capaldis hand as the tears spurted yes hed known where maria was going today even wishing her luck last night yeah shed said with a limp goodnight wave of the hand tally ho cindy it wasnt something she enjoyed any more it was something she had to do like hospital visiting or donating blood he shivered shot shot dead in a clearing in the forest the paper said the cleaner was right it didnt bear thinking about like she was lying in a bed mrs capaldi said faintly a sheet tucked up around her chin cindy looked at hatch mortuary hatch mumbled there was an uncomfortable silence hatch made eye contact with the policewoman more tea i think alison cindy said what kind of person are you looking for this stage we have to examine all the options my moneys on some sixteenyearold yobbo who at this moment is a very frightened kid or a hunt supporter hatch smiled thinly now youre being controversial mr lewis pah said mrs capaldi unters big family lotsa money you never gonna pin it on a unters mrs capaldi i can assure you that at this stage nobody has been ruled out pah mrs capaldis tearglazed eyes rising to a lurid preraphaelite madonna over the fireplace she was a good girl a lovely girl when she wanted she got principles more than me her father e ad principles me i like peace and quiet she say mum she say you just a cucumber vegetable make me so mad sometime maria had integrity cindy said she believed that everything had a right to life mrs capaldi struggled to the edge of the sofa as the policewoman approached with a cup i don wan more tea i told you i wan see where my daughter die its my right i wan you take me cindy in your car as i said mrs capaldi hatch said quickly i wouldnt advise it not at the moment therell be press everywhere and tv crews wassa problem with tv an a papers i don wan ush this up i wan everybody know what these bastard do hatch shot an appeal at cindy but cindy pretended not to notice he said of course ill take you my love mr lewis catharsis inspector catharsis dont you think hatch sighed all right in which case perhaps we should all go with wpc webber in the police car or you might have trouble getting past our people cindy nodded helping mrs capaldi to her feet in the event there were no cameramen as hatch must have known this part of the forest was sealed off by a police road block on the track the immediate area was taped there were several police hanging around although there didnt seem to be much for them to do except to drive away photographers and sensationseekers and try not to look at mrs capaldi as soon as you want to leave hatch said she shook her head waved him away peaceful she said such a beautiful place nowhere is safe any more shed put on a black hat and black gloves dark glasses being the centre of attention had calmed her cindy thought the irony of it was that if it hadnt been family mrs capaldi who read lurid magazines would have derived a shivery excitement from being so close to a murder investigation she crossed herself and walked alone into the trees hatch nodded to wpc webber to follow her a soft earlyevening sun cast a pastel glaze on the forest yes it was a lovely spot and yet left alone cindy felt suddenly tense if this outing was going to be cathartic for mrs capaldi it was having quite the opposite effect on him there was a sense of imbalance of the world itself horribly askew a young bearded detective with a mobile phone came over bloody hell sir did you know there were no less than four crossbow clubs in the general vicinity whats the world comingoh sorry hatch hustled the detective away from cindy who was startled a crossbow in the paper it had said simply that maria had been shot the police were obviously sitting on the crossbow angle for the moment what else had they not yet disclosed cindy stood motionless in the clearing it was still an old woodland part of the prehistoric and medieval landscape he liked to walk on sundays fordingbridge to the northwest a castle mound beyond there several tumuli and of course as soon as theyd arrived hed spotted the motte and bailey nearby probably built on a prehistoric site it would certainly have been here when william rufus he closed his eyes emptied his mind and at once felt a frigid trembling in his solar plexus and a powerful sense of residual evil around this softlit glade a crossbow an horrific flashimage of maria with a steel bolt nailing her to the floor of the forest he turned away his hands cold and tingling he moved to the edge of the tape and walked away along the track for a few yards has something occurred to you mr lewis he turned sharply to find dci hatch right behind him yes he said i suppose something has do you want to tell me its probably already occurred to you being a local man do you know the story of the death of william ii william rufus son of the conqueror shot in the forest wasnt he by a man with a oh right a crossbow cindy said in this very forest about eight hundred years ago as i recall hatch said unlikely were looking for the same man then no and no it hadnt occurred to me hatch said flatly im afraid perhaps not so much a man chief inspector as a tradition we know who killed william it was his own huntsman walter tirel during a hunting expedition the king shot a stag wounding it following its flight and holding up his hand ostensibly to protect his eyes from the brightness of the setting sun at which signal tirel purporting to aim at another stag shot the king hatch said signal showing he had at least been paying attention do you know the margaret murray theory that william was a ritual sacrifice the only margaret murray i know hatch said heavily is a labour councillor on the police committee this one was an academic an historian dr murray published her anthropological history of witchcraft and paganism in her theory was that although william rufus might have appeared to support the church it seems likely he was a lifelong pagan as the king he would have been regarded as a god incarnate and he was growing old well a god could never grow old or weak or feeble he must die for his people to strengthen their attachment to this new land and of course as the king he was permitted to select the time and circumstances of his own ritual death dubious privilege hatch said no doubt thinking old welsh queens lost his marbles cindy walked into the centre of the clearing the king had prepared himself for death had eaten and drunk well and taken possession of six fresh bolts for his crossbow two of which he handed to walter tirel before they left when he was shot william then broke off the wooden shaft of the bolt and fell upon the stump very interesting sir hatch said but id be glad if you wouldnt mention crossbows to anyone at this stage probably be common knowledge by tomorrow but by then we canve pinned down every crossbowowning nutter between here and cindy said do you see the beauty of it william let the earth finish him to be honest mr lewis i dont see much of a link here two crossbow killings eight hundred years apart just thought you should be aware of it chief inspector yes thank you very much sir do you think we could persuade mrs capaldi to go home now part one stone with magnetic or radioactive properties seems to have been incorporated into some monuments certain parts of the brain are sensitive to magnetic fields particularly the temporal lobe region which houses the organs that process memory dreams and feeling there is an archaic tradition of sleeping on stones of power to achieve visions paul devereux earth memory i three years later the autumn night he died bobby maiden was drinking single malt full of this smoky peat essence put you in mind of somewhere damp and lonely moorland meeting the sea no visible horizon the whiskies were on the house all five of them could be the same went for the woman who was starting to look more than ok the arrangement of her tooblack hair coming apart in a tumble sexy as a bathrobe falling open face white lipstick a luminous mauve all very gothic when you hadnt been in this situation for quite a while you tended to forget what an overscented lady in a pastedon black frock could do when she was concentrating so bobby shaking out a fresh cigarette your old man was one too then five whiskies about right for explaining how the old bastard shafted him a real one maiden said not many left as hed keep telling you a plod village copper deepest cheshire i mean theres nowhere very deep in cheshire any more but there was then police sergeant norman maiden never norman certainly never norm not with the uniform on question of respect madam well after midnight now just maiden and this woman called susan in tony parkers nasty new club in the grim concrete west end of elham how this had happened hed arranged to meet percy gilbert snout of the year be worth your time mr maiden no question noone else in elham cid had any time never mind money for percy these days but it was bobby maidens weekend off so nothing lost nothing at all sadly but the bugger hadnt shown maiden had ordered a scotch and the barman wouldnt take any money special introductory offer for new members the drinkll be brought to your table sir on these soiled streets a police warrant card bought more drinks than american express but he didnt think the barman knew him next thing the womans arriving with a tray claiming to be parkers niece from london by this time the gears are whirring cogs clicking into place a nicely oiled mechanism starting up the sound of tony parker making his move mr unnickable mr immunity maiden deciding to roll with it see where it led course all the kids were terrified of this flesheating dinosaur in the tall hat he had the human race divided into three the police the evil toerags and the public who were grateful for your protection and showed a bit of respect so there was only one role for a real man and particularly for son of plod thing was su suzanne that was the name but remembering it hed forgotten what he was going to say suzanne put down her vodka and orange kind of thoughtful what had she asked him to start him off about norman plod whats a sensitive guy like you doing in the police maybe couldnt remember one thing about suzanne she was professionally unknown to maiden that is not one of tony parkers regular slags plus she had a certain bizarre style there was some poet bobby wrote this really deepdown truthful line tennyson keats one of those i dont go much on poetry but your mum and dad they always fuck you up something like that wordsworth would it be maiden ogled the ceiling that would be before or after he wrote about the fucking daffs nah what im saying a man like him suzanne leaned her head back blew out smoke i can see a man like your dad why he wouldnt want you to be a painter or nothing like that and then you get out of your nancified art college what happens then eh norman plod gardening in police boots and ragged old police shirts what you gonna do for readies then with no government grant to prop yer up eh eh maiden realized he was doing his norman plod out loud artists parasites lad nobody wants em till theyve snuffed it live off the state and sponging off their mates go bloody mad cut their ears off cut their ears off maiden shook his head id forgotten about that right yeah suzannes white face bobbing like a japanese dolls i think i heard of a guy that happened to fancy was this woman real look norman said back from the conservative club flattening a tube of flake white with his size nines do yourself a favour get rid of this nancy shit else theyll think youre a poof think youre a poof lad what a bastard did you what get rid of it no just went undercover and still was there were nights now when he was painting through till dawn pale minimal imaginary landscapes not much more than air and light paintings of the white noise in his head not in fact a long way from the cuttingofftheear stage when you thought about it what do you paint places feelings usual crap never sold one never tried coppers little hobby who needs it me i need it he thought theres nothing else isnt that terminally pathetic suzanne smoked in silence for a few seconds then she said so you wanted to paint and he was determined you were going to trail in his big footsteps where was your mother all this time bobby maiden stared into his glass in heaven you know what happens to them coppers like maiden the sensitive ones two possible career projections either they go to the top faster than they deserve this was martin riggs divisional super now talking to veteran di barry hutchins at the cid christmas binge barry just loved to tell this story especially loved telling maiden who unforgivably avoided the christmas binge barry had taken a retirement deal worked for group four security now so he could say what he liked or else they crack up riggs tells barry top themselves look at the situation hes thirtyfive still a di goes off to the met cant stand the heat and hes back after a year in this job barry if you want to get on you dont come back this was very true you certainly dont come back when the new boss is someone you happened to run into in london in circumstances that convinced you he was bent you still got them bobby huh your paintings her eyes were opaque oh only i wouldnt mind seeing them suzanne said he choked off a laugh into the whisky let me get this right youre saying you would like to come up and see my etchings whatever suzanne ground her cigarette into the ashtray and reached across the table for her bag you mean now got to think got to think all right then he said ill just pop to the bog alone in the gents maiden slapped cold water on his face ok think owen anthony parker entrepreneur fairly new in town cheery beaming londoner making a fresh start in the provincial leisure industry looks dodgy as hell but no record in no time at all parker has two clubs one lowlife one upmarketish and five pubs public figure hosts charity evenings thanks to mr parker elham general hospital has its longbattledfor new bodyscanner also thanks indirectly to mr parker the recently opened drugdependency unit has a whole bunch of extra clients tony parker mr immunity why well several people have a good idea and somebody in cid has to be fully in the picture maiden dried his face on a paper towel too many whiskies for this really still see what happens then suzanne by the time the minicab dumped them outside the blackened victorian block at the bottom of old church street where it meets the bypass her perfume was everywhere at first it was sexy then it became nauseating maiden always got sick in the back of cars thigh to thigh they hadnt talked much he hadnt made a move on her he still had some style plus there was the problem that the quiet grizzled cabbie just might have been the father of a kid nicked for dealing crack three months back a kid whod sworn the bastards had planted the stuff clutton dean clutton this is nice bobby its just a nice front door sorting drunkenly through his keys not nice at all inside might not have been cluttons dad too dark to tell really he unlocked the communal door with the lacquered brass knocker and five illuminated bell pushes dean clutton had hanged himself in his cell while on remand this was the thing before maiden got a chance to talk to him sad isnt it suzanne said wistfully long fingers playing with the collar of her black silk jacket what you start your married life all fresh and clean get yourself a nice tidy little home together it was a little georgianstyle semi in baslow road yeah it was nice for a while and tidy except for the night liz had impaled four canvases one after the other on the pointed newel post at the top of the stairs one after the other with a stiff crackly ripping sound that was when hed taken the chance of a transfer to the met a new start somewhere neither of them had connections where theyd need to rely on each other as it turned out liz had hated it hated her job at the huge crazy london hospital liz wanted to come back there was a vacancy for a di in elham division hed walked into it back with the old crowd who resented him naturally baslow road suzanne mused i wouldnt know where that is being a stranger she followed him inside and he felt for the light switches flipped all three but only one greasy yellow bulb came on youre right suzannes nose wrinkling as she took in the state of the hallway it is a bit of a shithole you ok bobby youre not going to throw up are you he said youre not serious about this are you course im serious why i came suzanne said come on lets see them all right despite the halfdozen whiskies bobby maiden on the last night of his life was feeling almost shy as he propped the biggest canvas against the tv this was weird he couldnt figure this out at all started out like a direct approach now it was just very strange just as coppers in the met above a certain rank could expect an invitation to join the masons in elham thered be a friendly innocent overture from the tony parker organization it was like a recognition of status almost above board because maiden stayed off the police social circuit it had been a long time coming but now it was here and it was strange little haven youve created here suzanne ran a finger along the art books grinned bobbys burrow maiden propped the other pictures against the table legs acrylics and some watercolours because there was less mess and they were easier to conceal if anybody turned up nobody at the nick had ever known about it hey suzanne said not what i was expecting where is it bobby morocco the big canvas had a full moon like a lamp over sand dunes formby wheres that the liverpool riviera costa del shite you make it look dead exotic youre an imaginative guy arent you what the defence lawyers say to me look you dont really want to see this crap i thought we i like the way youve done the colours of the sandhills like you can see colours in places the rest of us cant her coat was off and her hair had come all the way down it was cold as usual in here and she had her arms entwined around her pushing her breasts together he shuddered with an unsuppressible spasm of longing all wrong of course the very last thing you did was let them into your private life if you could call this dump private or what he had here a life or is it wainwright what guy who painted those night pictures suzanne said greenish with like full moons they were liverpool and industrial kind of places too only he made them look dead romantic atkinson wainwright tonys really into him hes got three or four now a couple anyway grimshaw maiden said knowledgeably tony parker was into atkinson grimshaw as well as prostitution gambling and drugs suzanne said course seeing this guys dead his pictures are worth a stack like your dad said and a good investment still tony buys new things as well if he likes them and then he has the artist killed to make it worthwhile you want some coffee wine suzanne smiled he might like these might well like them he went still the moon and the sand suzanne said tonyd go for that one certainly the moon in the painting wobbled in the deep green sky maiden was gripping the edge of the table as a voice from somewhere said careful be cool flush her out forget the pictures he said lets go upstairs which made no sense it was a ground floor flat no i reckon suzanne stood back from the moon picture pursing her lips i reckon a picture like that tony would give what seven grand its the moon that does it tonys ever so partial to a full moon he saw for the first time the mocking intelligence in the smoky eyes cash of course suzanne said coolly he started to laugh so tony wants me on his wall he couldnt decide whether it was ridiculously naive or totally brilliant five whiskies said brilliant and what do i have to do suzanne sat down she chose the wooden garden chair by the gas fire maybe making a point about the unnecessary frugality of his lifestyle you really his niece suzanne you really an artist see im authorized to negotiate with artists policemen that might be open to misinterpretation whats he looking for his head felt as if it was floating away from his body bit new to this game game bobby blind eye friend at court seven grand not a bad base seven grand could get you out of here seven grand could get you into a rented cottage somewhere damp and lonely seven grand could christ you cant help thinking about it can you seven grand for a painting take the money and run run run and maybe in a couple of months time suzanne said blandly if you were to come up with something else tony wanted like youre the artist why dont you spell it out maiden said easily were both grownup people who else has he got on the wall biggish wall is it look she stood up smiling at him kindly like an auntie been a long night lovey you must be completely shagged out you have a nice think about it you know where to find me picking up her silk jacket from the block pine coffee table he moved towards her knocking over the moon picture who else besides mr riggs he said shit couldnt believe hed said that too much to drink could feel it slipping through his hands like a fish now swimming away into the murk i just wouldnt like to do anything the boss would seriously disapprove of disastrous im not following you bobby slinking into the jacket tucking her hair down the collar shouldering her bag he put his hand over hers on the door catch noticing that the last light in the communal hall had finally expired a dead bulb with a dark halo of cobwebs on a frayed wire night night bobby suzannes voice was lower and harder as she detached his hand from the door all right no he said the night is positively embryonic and you are aw forget it you blew it worse still you left yourself wide open members of the jury the defendant has claimed that he took this woman back to his flat to show her my paintings stupid the day before he retired from the job barry hutchins had said to maiden some divisions you find being a tiny bit bent is strongly advisable just a spot of oil on the wheels a tweak on the steering lets face it most coppers are introduced to it not by villains but by other coppers starts in a small way like being shown which cafes on your beat will give you a free coffee which restaurants operate a twenty per cent police discount problem i found is you never quite know whose toes you might be treading on by not accepting a bung know what i mean youre walking a tightrope in this town now he stood inside the door listening for the sound of her feet in the hall she hadnt gone suzanne he opened the door wide no sound out there but his own voice dancing around the walls but she hadnt gone suzanne maiden called softly into the darkness of the lobby just confirm something for me would you no reply tell tony thanks very much but why would he need me when hes got riggs once youd soaked your boats in paraffin you might as well apply the match martin riggs hotshot from the met brought in to clean up seedy little midland town on a promise supers job if he does well when old stan white retires and riggs does extremely well hoovering up a bunch of dealers pimps smalltime hard men in no time at all suzanne nothing but he felt an odd tingle in the dark air always struck him as curiously coincidental that riggs and parker should arrive in town around the same time and what an amazing cleanup rate the elham messenger loved it streetcrime down again loved him police chiefs drug war pays off everybodys happy suzanne dealers working for one boss job security long as nobody gets too greedy and the toms better working conditions more respectable pimps much healthier all round not for everybody bobby not for you the way youre going on even though it was still september the lobby had a late autumnal dampplaster smell listen bobby just listen her voice was different do yourself a favour shut the fuck up and make yourself scarce youre playing well out of your league can you silence like she was afraid of being overheard he switched off the light in the flat and slipped outside found a patch of shadow and snuggled into it click click of heels suzanne making for the front door he slid after her back to the wall think riggs will have confirmation now maiden knows maiden doesnt like it maidens not up for a buyoff in regular instalments maidens not one of the lads maiden is well under the feet bobby suzannes voice very low look go back in your flat and lock the door you know what im saying he could see her shape now in the doorway bobby from outside im not kidding i like you ok i like you you stupid sod cant you get a transfer or something jesus what a fucking mess footsteps fading aye go on nancy lock yourself in go back to your painting not any more norman maiden came out quickly in a crouch didnt make for the steps edged instead around the side of the building where a short passageway ended in an iron gate bad move if that was where they were waiting but unless theyd checked out the building by daylight they wouldnt be nobody grabbed him his relief came out as a rough sob he stayed in the passage breathing in its acrid stalepiss air until he heard her heels moving down the steps at which he moved out into the overgrown ironrailed garden because god help him he wanted to know who was waiting for her he crept down the steps seeing suzanne for the last time when she passed beneath a sodium streetlamp he felt a confusing pang how could he possibly without the gothic makeup in different circumstances just the two of them somewhere damp and lonely the street was very still rundown victorian villas turned into flats or boarded up a derelict pub no parked cars doubleyellow zone maiden came quietly down to the pavement the streetlamps shimmered in oily puddles the tarmac still pitted from a laying of new drains no sign of suzanne he stepped off the kerb to peer further up the street out here his head was clearing pleasanter now he began to stroll up the road hands in his pockets the essence of peat coming back to him damp and lonely funny thing now liz was gone now he could go where he liked he just hadnt hed stayed in elham sorting out burglaries and domestic murders occasionally going out with unsuitable women building up the tony parker file on his home computer waiting for a break waiting for something to give wondering how it could all have gone so wrong thinking that if he could just nail parker and riggs hed walk away from it after fifteen wasted years he stopped there she was again across the street under a dodgy streetlamp which kept flickering on and off and even when it was on it wasnt fully on so you could almost see the filament in the bulb a worm of bluewhite light she was standing under the lamp and seemed to be going on and off like the light you saw her and then you didnt there was a roar two flat discs of greasy yellow spinning out of telford avenue turning to blinding white when they came round the corner suzanne screamed and it was strange her voice in extremis sounded bizarrely refined oh christ vic no for fucks sake the voice diverted him for a moment the wrong moment in the very next moment his last conscious moment two tail lights like dirty red pimples wobbled and blurred before a great and welcome silence came over him like a big soft blanket at am detective inspector bobby maiden died in hospital ii guardis deli was just around the block from the new york courier i mean jesus grayle said making for the window table you look at this realistically im the one should be missing like ersula was always the intense academic sister and im the crazy bitch with the crystals and the tarot cards and the eye of horus earrings before lyndon could even sit down she was dumping her bag on the table then she goes off to england pulling out the leaflet then this the university of the earth as we prepare to enter the third millennium many of us feel the need for a deeper understanding of the land around us how our distant ancestors related to their environment and what that tells us about how we should respond to itthe countryside of britain remains a great enigma we are surrounded by the mysterious monuments of antiquity megalithic remains prehistoric burial mounds and chambers the holy places of the pastin recent years the study of such remains has appeared to become the preserve of a new age fringe whose theories about ley lines and earthenergies have been scorned by the archaeological establishmentthe university of the earth is the first serious attempt to bridge this gulf by undertaking a formal but openminded investigation of the mysteries in our landscape the project is being steered by the eminent archaeologist and anthropologist prof roger falconer presenter of the channel four programme diggersto help fund the university of the earth project and allow for the involvement of interested amateurs a select series of summer schools has been scheduled to be based at prof falconers farm on the welsh border and involving lectures practical work and expeditions to a number of key sites including stonehenge avebury silbury hill and the rollright stonesprof falconer says my twentyfive years of study have shown me that there are many lessons to be learned from our most remote ancestors while i have little truck with nonsense about the earth once being ruled by aliens or radiant beings from the lost continent of atlantis i do believe that the people of the bronze age in particular possessed certain skills allied to a heightened perception of the natural world of which most of us are no longer awareit is one of the aims of the university of the earth to study methods of working with the earth and discover how effective they are in a scientific frameworkdowsing for instance not only for water but for archaeological remains has been shown to be surprisingly successful and we shall be putting its practitioners to the test under survey conditions as well as giving our guests an opportunity to see if they themselves possess the abilitywhile i am personally convinced that some dowsers have an extraordinary ability other schemes and theories i find considerably less convincing however the spirit of the university of the earth is one of exploration and my younger colleagues magda ring and adrian fraserhale will be conducting experiments on what we might call the outer fringes notably the dream survey in which volunteers will sleep at ancient sites and record their dreams in an attempt to discover whether human consciousness is influenced by the alleged electromagnetic properties of stone monumentsalthough its aims are serious those of us involved in the university of the earth have had a great deal of fun the inevitable arguments between the archaeological purists and the earthmysteries enthusiasts have been essentially goodnatured and suggest that we share a common goal to uncover the deepest secrets of the distant past and use them to develop a more harmonious relationship between the human race and its native planetearly application for the university of the earth summer schools is advisable as places on the courses are strictly limited cost per head for one week is a basic lyndon mcaffrey sitting stately as a supreme court judge put down the leaflet and ordered up some doughnuts well he said you gotta admire the guys technique like how we gonna persuade gullible rich folk to hand over megabucks for a week spent shovelling shit out of a trench hey lets tell em theyre helping a famous tv star unlock the secrets of the universe grayle thought this was a tad unfair shed called her father at harvard and hed called up a friend at oxford university about professor falconer and ascertained that outside of television the man was a respected academic with his name on about seventeen books just he has the popular touch nicelooking charming dates actresses like that uhoh said lyndon this makes him a shyster necessarily well no it just dont win him instant sympathy from fat old guys such as myself so your sister is what not one of your gullible rich folk ersula was on the staff for the summer one of the expert research team they had several archaeology graduates helping organize the field trips and stuff like that of course they werent paying her anything either apart from expenses and accommodation but she was allowed to be part of the great experiment too lyndon said with a wry fatcat smile educated people can be soooooo naive nnnnn grayle shook her head this woman is a believer in neither god nor spaceships a sober bookish person her fathers daughter you know five weeks ago their mother folding ersulas last letter from england had said lightly well shes getting into some stimulating areas shes having fun in her own way i guess it was true that ersulas official letter to mom had been mostly about what fun she was having and how hospitable and kind the brits were not stiff and stuffy like you were led to expect her letter to their father although more academically oriented would likewise include nothing pertaining to nights spent under prehistoric stone monuments that ersulas letter to grayle was more revealing came as no big surprise since mom went off with the younger lover and dad locked himself in his harvard tower theyd become warily closer for the first time in years the letter began you may be interested in some of this but for christs sake dsf dsf dont show the folks ersulas last letter before the silence run this past me one more time lyndon said your younger but normally more balanced sister has been sleeping in a stone age burial chamber she lose her credit cards or what if you arent going to take this seriously jesus said lyndon whose job at the new york courier was all about knowing which stories to take seriously the waitress arrived with the doughnuts and they helped themselves the waitress stepped back studying grayle she was a new waitress no see the problem with ersula grayle inspected her doughnut then shrugged and took a bite balanced yeah ok in some ways but also passionate more than that obsessive she gets into something its like whooosh unlike you lyndon mcaffrey said heavily unlike me like ersula would not eat this doughnut she doesnt do comforteating ersula is very controlled has concentration focus all of that dear god said lyndon we hired the wrong sister also as a committed academic ersula vaguely despises the inevitable superficiality of journalism lyndon mcaffrey nodded moodily twentyfive years ago hed become the papers first black deputy city editor since then thered been three black city editors and lyndon well he was still number two he knew all about being vaguely despised hey the waitress suddenly screamed you are i saw you on tv youre grayle underhill holy grayle for crissakes this is incredible this is fate i was gonna write to you i need your help the waitress pulled out a chair flopped into it see my boyfriend who most times is this real sweet guy every few weeks he comes on kind of mean and i noticed this is true i swear on my mothers grave he has to shave twice three times a day lyndon looked down at his plate closed lips strained by an uhhuh kind of smile time of the full moon huh grayle said without enthusiasm see i tell this to people the waitress said and theyre like oh sure then im reading that thing you wrote about how men they all have this werewolf element to a degree and im going right shit yes this is the woman i have to talk with and now here you are you tell me this isnt like karma or something grayle said listen uh marcia marcia right ok the piece i wrote marcia that was like an interview with the author of this book the lycanthropic virus which examines the effect of the full moon on society and blah blah blah so if you have a problem in this area the person you need to uh approach is the author d harvey baumer maybe if you wrote him through the publisher that would take forever marcia said dubiously see the way you wrote the article it was like you really had a handle on the whole thing yeah thats thats part of the job marcia look all i can suggest is maybe if i was to do an article on your situation grayle pulled a pen from her bag so your second name is uhuh marcia was up on her feet and back behind the counter in a couple of seconds i dont think so i think i misunderstood i mean you sound like some kind of journalist lyndon started to chuckle dusting sugar crystals from his big hands this is not funny grayle told him when marcia mercifully had gone to wait on another table i get this all the time you write a new age column people think you must be a person of like higher dimensions you write a crime column they think youre a sleazeball with mob connections lyndon said unsympathetically whats your problem this is different this is about spirituality how do i know im not messing up someones immortal soul how do i know how much of what im publicizing is true or at least well intentioned and lifeenhancing crime you know who the bad guys are new age you can never be quite sure grayle licked raspberry jam from her fingers nearly thirty years separated her and lyndon a sweet tooth glued them together journalism could be a hostile world especially when most of your colleagues thought everything you wrote about was a piece of crap ersula thinks i just peck around things like a chicken she thinks that huh lyndons eyes widened imagine yeah yeah screw you too maybe shes right back when i was in college and she was still in school we were both heavily into new age like wed talk about cosmic consciousness and read the tarot and stuff in my room and have a lot of innocent fun i shouldve realized that ersula even then she only had serious fun she would throw herself into something and then emerge the other side dismissing it all as bullshit when she was fourteen or fifteen and i was at college i found shed been you know initiated as a witch eye of newt lyndon was unfazed toe of frog as i recall they were known as the hermetic sisterhood of central park west i didnt look too closely at her altar i think it was just candles and pentagrams but she made sure and piled it all in the trash before the folks got home from vacation it was ok by then shed concluded this was all phoney shit anyway you wanted to get into the real authentic stuff you checked out true ethnic sources it was a short hop from there to anthropology and related studies and to despising her sister her sisters crystals her sisters amulets ok go ahead read the letter st marys herefordshire england august dear graylefirst off if you want the nice stuff about the accommodation and the scenery and all the wonderful people im meeting you should read moms letter im not doing that crap twiceok you may be interested in some of this but for christs sake dsfas i may have indicated i was frankly skeptical about the university of the earth summer school there is a lunatic fringe which has infiltrated archeology here in britain people who believe ancient sites were strung out in mystical straight lines to follow the courses of some mysterious earthpower which they cannot define except to say it can give you a buzz and i was less than enthusiastic at the thought of working with an organization which seeks to build bridges with these airheadshowever in the absence of a better way of researching prehistoric remains in the british isles and getting paid for it here i am in this tiny comparatively isolated village on the border of england and walesso okthe dreaming experimentthe airheads have been suggesting for some time that human consciousness can be altered or infiltrated by the energies at ancient burial mounds stone circles whatever and that this occurs most effectively during sleepour distant ancestors were people whose daytoday survival depended upon an intimacy with their environment an understanding which we today would consider inexplicably precognitive of what the earth was going to do and when dreams were considered to be an important way in which useful information was conveyed to them in the old testament wasnt it jacob who slept on a pillow of stone and had prophetic dreams while in ancient china the emperor would spend the whole night on stone before making some important decision you get the ideathe university of the earth dream survey aims to establish whether specific images or motifs occur in the dreams of people sleeping at particular sacred sites individuals elect to spend the night in a sleeping bag inside a circle or a burial chamber with a helper or therapeute who while they sleep stays awake with a tape recorder watching for the rapid eye movement which will indicate they are dreaming at which stage the dreamer is awoken and gives a full resume of the dream into the recorderoffthewall yeah i thought so when i was appointed therapeute to a middleaged woman who talked about meeting fairies with which she frolicked naked under a waterfall then roger suggested i should sleep at a site myself and my mind was somewhat blown by an extraordinary vivid and lucid dream one in which i was fully aware of dreaming and able to function on a mental level i would never have imagined possiblei was you might say hooked lyndon shook sugar from ersulas letter looks like shes headed back your way which is not good for the reasons i already stated whooosh as an academic ersula believes nowadays in the power of the mind over the power of the spirit well ok she has a good mind and im stupid and when youre stupid all you got to fall back on most of the time is like the dream that some kind of spiritual earthquake will come along and get us out of all this shit this may be getting too heavy and west coast for a poor brooklyn boy lyndon said grayle stared at the river of blood seeping out of the halfeaten doughnut for ersula nothing was an inexplicable phenomenon any more so nothing was spiritually threatening she looked up saw her own frustrated face in the mirror across the counter lumps of blond hair all over the place the eye of horus earrings swinging crazy grayle underhill new age subculture columnist widely syndicated huh i said if theres some way i can help you lyndon mcaffrey said patiently maybe you could just lay it out for me in moronspeak finish the letter grayle said im delaying you your wife will think youre having an affair haw said lyndon he picked up the second sheet of blue airmail paper and read it with obvious concentration before rereading the first sheet hmm he grunted thoughtfully i begin to see your pointat night you discover stone is always coldsleeping on stone thats not natural you awake time after time usually uncomfortable as hell and sometimes in a panic simply because of the stone all around you well thats good it shouldnt come easy not at first without a challenge there can be no achievementwhich is just as well because this particular burial chamber where i slept last night is fully exposed the earthmound which once concealed it having long since eroded it is like a long low stone table on little stubby legs or maybe a clump of big mushrooms fused together kind of weirdlooking but not what you would call spectacular indeed without a largescale map you would not find it at all except by accidentwell certainly not at nightunder your head is an old gray stone which you can feel as though there was no sleeping bag there at all what it makes you think of is those petrified pillows supporting marble effigies on tombs in old churches creepy huhhey come on this is a scientific experimentanyway like i said when you sleep on stone sometimes you awake but youre not awake if this makes sense you know you cant be because the stone isnt cold nor even hard youre sinking into it so damn grateful it isnt cold and hard any more that you just let yourself luxuriate in it and down you go quite painlessly into the ground into the earth your subconscious mind that is or whatever you want to call the part of you that admits the dreamsyou come to realize that the very easiest phase is the letting go i say easy it was hard for me at first i am as you can guess the odd one out on this course most of the others being halfassed pseudomystics who are just here for the buzz you will notice grayle that i have been at pains not to say people like youthey tell you not to think too hard before you go to sleep so maybe its just as well your main concern is to get comfortable if you go into waking fantasies and your conscious mind influences your dreams this is a bad thing obviouslybefore you know it youve been gently awoken and the therapeute is whispering did you dream tell me describe it to meyou feel wonderful then you did it you interactedthe actual interacting the dreaming often becomes well kind of scary if you want the truth not at all what youre expecting maybe it has occurred to you that this place where youre sleeping when it comes down to it when you get beyond all the screwball stuff about secret energies and the healing powers of mother earth is a gravea repository for bodies flesh has rotted here bones have crumbledthe claustrophobia at this point can be intense you start to scream inside all you want is out of there but like i said you have to stop your conscious mind getting a hold of you what you are dealing with here is the unconscious and that must be left to find its own route to what you would probably call enlightenmentin relation to this ok there is one small problem i am toldyou know how in nightmares when you get into a very frightening situation like youre about to fall a thousand feet onto rocks or you turn around to find the psycho with the ax was behind the door all the time you awakewell sleeping in a prehistoric burial chamber so they tell me you cant always count on this happening implying that under these physical conditions it is possible to reach a deeper level of unconsciousness this i am convinced is the first step to a scientific explanation of socalled prophetic dreaming as supposedly experienced by jacob and tribal shamans the world over and it excites me profoundlybefore you say a word sure ive heard that stuff about how if you werent able to awake from a nightmare when you got into a terminally tight corner youd just dielike i said its important that it isnt easy that there are risks nothing significant is ever achieved without risk your parents seen any of this lyndon mcaffrey solemn now maybe the old newsmans antennae starting to vibrate grayle shook her head dont show the folks pain of death we used to put it on cards and letters when we were kids when you were kids is one thing listen its bad enough we havent had a letter or a phone call in five weeks no i didnt show it to them then and i dont plan to my father would be acutely embarrassed on his younger childs behalf and blame it on my mothers genes like he does with me mom would be spooked all the way to the cocaine cupboard no hell this is down to me time for crazy grayle to get her shit together ok lyndon leaned back what are your own personal conclusions here that ersula blew out her mind under some old stone and went native among the primitive brits i know you dont believe any more than my father would that my sister could be psychically damaged by any of this you dont believe for one second that shes messing with awesomely powerful cosmic forces you think more likely she got laid inside a stone circle fell in love lost track of time ok lyndon said what do you plan to do about it well i already called this university of the earth summer school spoke to a guy who was very helpful surprised we hadnt heard from ersula on account of the course ended a month ago and they presumed shed flown home he didnt sound like a fruitcake lyndons expression said he wouldnt trust grayle to identify a fruitcake at knifeswinging distance she averted her eyes so i i called the police department i guess therell be some kind of hookup with the english cops but the english police are very thorough lyndon said if theres anything wrong here theyll find out you dont think i should fly over there how would that help well it would help me i guess grayle you yourself admit that ersula is the balanced one and yeah she went to africa just out of high school and we didnt hear from her for close to two months but that was when the folks split her way of coming to terms with all that this is different shes a grown woman also she knows that if the very last letter i get from her is as weird as this ok lyndon said you have a point see what the cops come up with they may not be too enthusiastic about finding a grown woman whos only been missing a few weeks but being shes a professors daughter and all leave it to the cops right grayles voice a little too high youre right thats sensible lyndon nodded he folded the blue airmail letter tucked it under grayles coffee cup he hadnt read the other pages because she hadnt given them to him about ersulas dream the page with the disturbing details of ersulas dream lying out on the burial chamber so grayle went home to her windchimes and her crystals and her treeoflife wallchart tried to meditate gave up and half watched an old john wayne movie on tv until she fell asleep and dreamed uneasily about dreaming iii around twothirty am sister anderson scenting smoke slid quietly into the sluice room the young nigerian houseman jonathan bounced off the wall like a scared squirrel tossed his cigarette out of the window when he saw who it was jonathan looked no less intimidated sorry he muttered im sorry his face no longer black but grey with fatigue in the white lights these kids hed have been hardly born when sister andy redhaired then and vengeful had first hunted down wee nurses and sprog docs whod risked a ciggy in the sluice or the lavvies been a good while now since she last chewed the leg off a junior housie no fun terrorizing some holloweyed kid at the end of a sixteenhour shift but reputations stuck jonathan andy said wearily daft sod yare wasnae likely to be the chairman of the bloody hospital trust this time of night here have yourself a replacement jonathan looked surprised and then smiled tentatively still unsure whether it was a trap getting the cigarette to his mouth his hand shook poor wean twentysix years old veteran of three weeks in a and e two on the slaughterhouse shift aw come on son andy flashed the ancient zippo it happens you did your best no is that what i am supposed to keep telling myself every night for the next forty years its what ive been saying to young guys like you the last thirty andy sighed aye youre right its a trite wee phrase she lit up too having a good idea what was coming next i honestly dont think i am going to stick it jonathan said bleakly its like working in some sort of meatprocessing plant by midnight one gets so one doesnt want to go back out there if shed had twenty silk cut for every time an intern said that to her shed have gone down with nicotine poisoning years back what the hell was she supposed to say if she told him the truth of how bad it became hed just think she was stircrazy the truth was you grew to love it the stink the drips the bedpans the old guys who drooled you loved it all and when you took a holiday your heart ached to get back this was how bad it became but i mean jonathan said does anyone ever surprise you you know by suddenly responding to treatment does that happen any more and is anybody ever ever grateful oh thank you thank you doctor you saved ma life andy assuming a geriatric quaver stayed awake long enough to administer the right drugs in the right order a credit to the hospital trust she sighed ah jonathan in my own worst moments i figure if you manage to save a life you mustve beaten the system yknow the same way you loved the whingeing patients and the underpaid nurses and the thirtyyearold doctors looking fifty so you hated the suits the admin guys the caring cutglass quango ladies with their spectacles on gold chains and clipboards full of rationalization plans it was all a business now and the last thing businesses were about was healing she became aware that jonathan was looking down at her in some kind of awe sister andy my god its true isnt it you really are leaving us whereve you heard that knowing dammit that with the sharpness of her tone she was confirming it although it wasnt certain by no means well i somebody said you accepted a retirement package but someone else said it was just a vicious rumour and theyd never get you out out alive never get me out of here alive bloody hell jonathan i look that old and ruined jesus god were the damn sprogs beginning to pity her maybe it was time to start dyeing the hair again bring back the old red fiery red and halfway down her back when she came down from glasgow in sixtyfive faded ginger seven years ago when she and mick were divorced straggly grey now well you know a lot of people nowadays are taking early retirement jonathan said embarrassed to do the things they always promised themselves travel the world sod off said andy youre just digging yourself in deeper sorry another job then itll go no further i promise its just that if even you are getting out look son andy glared up smoking nohands pushing the words out the side of the ciggie if anybody wants to know im gonny marry a brilliant heart surgeon and fly out to his private clinic on paradise island ok sorry none of my business right said andy paradise sure paradise stripped down to a stone and timbered village huddled under the black mountains which were the lower vertebrae of the welsh border a paradise called st marys a grand wee place in its way a haven a sanctuary and the nearest general hospital twenty rugged miles away a clean break right enough jesus god was she really going through with it this time big hospitals most people found them soulless and scary but they gave andy just a fantastic buzz the smell of piss and disinfectant invigorating all her senses like ozone her element was her element in the days before the suits before healing got deprioritized ok andy said ill tell you the truth but it goes no further right jonathan placed his hand over his heart only ive been worried a while about the personal touch going out of health care like you said a production line i worry about the drug companies ruling the world yknow dont they ive been studying alternative healing andy said yknow what i mean jonathans eyes widened mumbo jumbo this is the question jonathan is it well now sister andy that is a very profound question glad you think so i was a wee bit scared to mention witch doctors and such in case you took it as some kind of racist slur on the african health service were all treading eggshells these days son jonathan grinned its all turned around again now witch doctors are part of a great cultural tradition and sometimes unlike us they still come up with the odd miracle but sister andy pardon me if this is racist one is not aware of a similar tradition here in the uk oh its there right enough just buried deeper ok couple of years ago before you came i developed what was turning into chronic ulcerative colitis yknow unpleasant and inconvenient you cannae do this job efficiently when youre spending half the morning in and out of the lavvy i was pretty desperate down to about eight stone eight asacols a day all i wanted was to sleep only it doesnae give you much sleep the colitis your hair falls out you develop big red lumps on your legs jonathan looked her up and down you seem fine now surgery andy shook her head nor drugs but its cured ask me how it happened were talking serious mumbo jonathans bleeper went off shutters slamming down on personal issues sister andy took his cigarette and held open the plastic door for him like the grizzled old guy in the war movies who pushes the paras out of the hatch get your arse outa here son andy said never let the bastards see the fear aye bugger the paramedic sweating i think hes bloody well arrested the injured guy was still strapped to the stretcher the red blanket wrenched back and the guys chest bared big nurse debbie barnes running alongside reaching for the carotid pulse hes right sister nothing oot the way debbie andys accent thickening the way it always did in crises come on son she hissed at the patient were no havin this bringing her fist down like a hammer on his chest lets have him on the table aye car or something the ambulance driver said helping debbie attach the terminals or mugged maybe didnt just fall over though hes had a few hit and run i reckon thrown over the bonnet comes down on his head nothing below seems to be broken but stuff the speculation andy said briskly no your problem michael defib come on move it blood from left ear left eye strong smell of whisky face jesus god face familiar monitor flat jonathan said drabvoiced as if it was a formality how long has he been no more than a minute the driver said still going ok in the van going strong mustve stopped on the way in shock catching up while the tube was going down before the ambibag went on andy fitted a history to the face on the end of the neck brace images clacking in like colour slides young copper sitting on a stool drinking cocoa in the winter dawn uniform flecked with snow and someone elses vomit waiting for some assault victim to get patched up ten years ago twelve a dead flat line on the monitor andy holding his head as jonathan got going with the paddles everyone else standing back come on son more like fifteen years ago maybe more the wee nurses collecting like starlings andy shooing them away but she could sympathize he was a nicelooking boy was bobby maiden young coppers one of the first things they learned as probationers was where they could grab a hot cocoa on the cold nights and a wee nurse for the night off those days bobby looked too young to be out at night on his own made his cocoa last didnt want to go back you could tell and always looked apprehensive but still cute and bright some nights and prey to lizzie turner clever ambitious lizzie not his type but you never knew come on bobby andys hands either side of his head fingers down the cold mudandbloodflecked face backing off as the paddle threw another seismic shudder into his chest were not getting anywhere sister go again jonathan lizzie turner and by then detective constable bobby maiden shed missed the glittering wedding somebody had to hold the fort down the pan now anyway lizzie working in some bupa clinic in shrewsbury they said and living with one of the suits a better cut of suit in a bupa clinic jesus god bobby andy closed her eyes the big light over the table making a warm orange globe inside her eyelids like the sun at dawn like the morning when marcus and mrs willis took her to black knoll told her how the sun had come down for the wee girl after the first world war marcus saying craftily that it sounded like a classic ufo encounter to him and mrs willis smacking him on the arm were wasting our time sister andy jonathan said three minutes gone three and a half keep going come on bobby you cannae go out like this son covered in shit stinking of whisky this was the routine that never became routine each time it knocked you back like the bolts jolting the person having his death invaded another electric punch the shudders going up both of andys arms it was a brutal business but that was modern medicine hit them with something mindless and powerful drugs and violence this was the modern manpowersaving health service streetlevel stuff incredible she should be thinking like this but andy was remembering the layingon of mrs williss hands later that morning back at the farmhouse and for nine more days on a diet of greens and windfall apples and water from the well this was when after thirty years faithfully wedded to a hospital something came through that turned into an itch nothing jonathans voice as flat as the monitor hes got to be over the vegetable threshold now anyway no dont stop ok taking it personally as always but tonight it was all the more intense because maybe there wouldnt be many more of them before sister andy dropped out to join the burgeoning ranks of the alternative healers to dangle from the lunatic fringe dispensing a layingon of fragrant hands to wellheeled cranks whod come to st marys because it was prettier than a rundown sparepart warehouse like this place and what was the alternative health sector what was it really but another small business leeching off the soft in the head jesus god which is right weve done all we can sister jonathans hands over andys trying to detach them from bobbys head but the amber sun was rising behind her eyes and its heat rushing all the way down to her hands to the tips of her fingers in the corpses bloodstiffened hair shes upset doctor debbie barnes sounding amazed at this as if she was watching the titanic going down cold the boy was long gone and the sun in her head turned suddenly black and she shuddered head to foot no andy cried aloud tears coming this was when the great roar went up iv once just after dawn the sun had come down for annie davies this phenomenon occurred early in the last century on midsummers day which happened to be her birthday it also took place on high knoll which was fair enough as far as marcus was concerned which actually in fact made perfect bloody sense however what was upsetting was this had it occurred almost anywhere else around the village annie davies might by now have been some kind of saint and the village a little lourdes this was how marcus bacton saw it anyway hoping as he stepped out of the castle ruins and set off across the meadow that the knoll had a little inspiration to spare for him that simply being there in the energy of dawn might somehow resolve the pressing question of what to do about mrs willis his housekeeper his best friend his doctor who possibly was dying who might in the end require the nursing home shed always sworn shed never enter but who if it came to it hed carry to the bloody knoll it had taken marcus years to piece together the story of young annie davies and the midsummer vision interesting the way the villages collective memory had filed it away under dont quite recall bastards come on then marcus walked more quickly afraid the sun was going to beat him to the top getting on for seven am and there was already a blush on the hill where the mist was thinning come on about twenty yards away malcolm the brindle and white bull terrier cross raised his bucket head briefly and went back to whatever dead and rotting item he was sniffing a couple of sheep watched him uneasily all right you bastard get your balls blown off see if i care problem being that the williams boy who leased the grazing from the jenkins brothers could get difficult about dogs upsetting his flock even malcolm who despised sheep even more than he despised marcus eventually the dog grudgingly ambled over and down they went through the meadow and up the pitch towards the knoll until the already reddening field lay below them like a slice of toast tossed from the mountain and marcus looked down as he always did and tried to see it as it must have looked to annie davies wouldnt be able to of course because he was now sixty and annie had been thirteen by just a few hours on the morning of her vision in a world still recovering from the great war the unheralded marriage of tommy davies a farmer well advanced in years to the local schoolmistress edna cadwallader must have provided a years worth of gossip for the dramastarved inhabitants of st marys annie was tommy and ednas only child born prematurely as they used to say in those days amy jenkins related only by marriage to the jenkins brothers owners of the meadow the knoll and another hundred acres who kept the oldest village pub had told marcus that her own mother used to say it was a bit of a funny family as schoolmistress edna had considered herself village intellectual she was a parish councillor too and would spend most nights at one meeting or another putting the community to rights and so annie had grown up closer to her aged father marcus often imagined as if it had really happened this way a strange still atmosphere on the night before the vision annie brewing a pot of strong tea for her dad and the two of them taking a mug each and wandering companionably down to great meadow watching the hayfield turn almost white in the deep blue dusk thirteen is it now the cooling mug must have looked like a thimble in tommy daviess huge barkbrown hands big age that is girl sure to be annies father probably didnt talk a great deal he would have been as old as most of the other village childrens grandfathers so when he made a pronouncement it would be charged for annie with a glowing significance like the words of an old testament prophet thirteen marcus saw her grinning up at tommy davies laying her mug on the grass and with a rush of coltish energy clambering over the wooden gate and dashing off down the track dividing great meadow with the first breath of the night billowing her cotton frock almost over her head the beginning of the parting and tommy too old and experienced not to accept it perhaps the image of annie had become inseparable now for marcus with the last picture of his own daughter sally who had died of leukaemia within months of her own thirteenth birthday perhaps this in truth was what had made him so determined to get castle farm the feeling that something of sally was here too that if hed known about the vision when she was dying he would have brought her here to the natural shrine which the church had denied soon what seemed like all of south herefordshire was at marcuss feet the crimson line of dawn drawn tight over the misty wooded hills cleft only by the stocky church tower of st marys the church was built on the site of a celtic hermits cell it was probably older than the woods and the fields for marcus the hills around the golden valley hid the lushest richest leastspoiled countryside in all of southern britain the villages had altered hardly at all and st marys was probably not so very different from when annie was here in those days it might even still have been known by its original welsh name llanfairyfynydd st marys in the mountains the village itself viewed from above seemed almost circular in its nest of wooded slopes from the churchyard you could look up and see the long dark ridge of the mountains but the eye would always be drawn back towards a single promontory which seemed to punch the sky like a dark gauntleted fist high knoll or black knoll as it was called in the village and now to marcuss disgust even on the maps when you got there it wasnt so stark although the grass was brown and rough around the stones the burial chamber on the knoll was far older than the church and even older than the celtic hermits cell annie davies would have been told by her mother at the village school that it was where heathen folk once came to worship the sun ignorant people who thought the sun was a god perhaps annie had been dismayed perhaps whenever shed tried to imagine god she like marcus had thought at once of the sun the brightest light in the sky wondering if that made her a heathen perhaps as she walked up to the big broken table of stones shed decided that the prehistoric people couldnt have been so very ignorant if they could find such a perfect place to greet the day and anyway jesus hadnt been born then so how were they to know about the true god they were worshipping the brightest light they knew what was so wrong about that tommy davies who wasnt well educated but was doubtless very wise might have told her that the people who built the monument were his ancestors the first farmers here and that having the bits of old stones up there somehow kept the land in good heart the burial chamber had been partially collapsed for centuries it was unlikely that even annie would have been able to get inside perhaps that morning she had clambered on top of the chamber the huge capstone and turned to watch the daily miracle of the sun trickling out of the horizon and lifted her face to the sky was that when it had happened about a hundred yards from the knoll along the steepening track of stones and baked red mud marcus had his first tantalizing glimpse of the top of the capstone just about make it in time for the dawn even more than three months after midsummer the view of the dawn from high knoll was never a disappointment and then he heard voices what on the knoll voices on the knoll at dawn marcus felt violated he stiffened snatched hold of malcolms collar clamped a hand over his muzzle accepting he had no right to feel like this wasnt castle land any more although it was marcuss ambition if for instance there was a sudden upturn ha in the fortunes of the phenomenologist to buy it back one day however the elderly reclusive jenkins brothers whose father had acquired the knoll as part of a land package in the late s seemed to accept the footpath as a right of way for the owners of the castle at least on this understanding marcus laboured up here at dawn twice a week summer and winter and in all that time hed never met a soul except for the intense american girl that one occasion and at least shed had the bloody decency to consult him first because at the knoll the dawn was his time his and annies and sallys there was a clump of rowan below the summit and marcus crept between the trees marching malcolm ahead of him and waited and listened a mans voice was drawling in that rhythmic up and down way that told you he wasnt really talking to anyone he could see now this is a fairly unexceptional chambered tomb dating back over four thousand years we cant get into the chamber any more because as you can see its collapsed in the middle of course what were looking at here are merely the bones of the structure originally all this would have been concealed by tons of earth and all youd have been able to see was a huge mound with an opening just here now i say its unexceptional except for one aspect the location there was silence for about half a minute marcus seethed how was that patrick we could run some music under the bit where we open up to the dawn spectacle do you think whats that da da thing from or is that a bit of a cliche no it might work roger just another thought when i pull back but before i open it out if you were to stand fractionally to the left how far this and back a bit hold it there spot on what i was thinking if we time this right do it just as its breaking through itll look as if the suns rising out of the top of your head nice effect what do you think hmm yes ok why not worth a try make a change marcus said loudly coming out of the trees from it shining out of his fucking arse he hauled himself up onto the small plateau of the knoll where there was hardly bloody room for him the molten orb in the east turning five faces florid as they all spun at him young fraserhale looked startled but otherwise unperturbed the haughty magda ring said oh for heavens sake and slapped her clipboard like a tambourine the cameraman swung round aiming his lens at marcus like an assassin with a rifle the sound man resentfully snatched off his headphones and falconer falconer just smiled marcus he said falconer in his furtrimmed motorcycle jacket and his ridiculously tight jeans falconer who strode the hills with his ponytail swinging followed by a string of adoring acolytes the old ladies he charmed the young ones who by all accounts he shagged senseless one realizes old chap he said how terribly fond you are of this place but we are working and as you see space is somewhat limited falconer with his weekly television audience of an estimated six million marcus with his ailing privatesubscription magazine circulation just under eight hundred and slipping his aversion to the man couldnt be as simple as that surely if i could just point out the cameraman said looking agitated that were going to have about four minutes maximum to get this shot before the sun goes behind a frigging cloud or something dont worry falconer said our friend just wandered up for a teensy snoop and now hes leaving arent you marcus old chap old chap always a slight emphasis on the old as a matter of fact no marcus flicked back his heavy grey hair and straightened his glasses i dont think i am big problem was most of the villagers seemed to love the bastard the starstruck idiots on his damned courses taking all the rooms at the local hotels and pubs filling up the holiday caravans on the mobilehome park jarman the postmaster claiming falconer was the biggest boost to the local economy since they closed the bloody railway but look at the bloody damage hes doing marcus would protest and theyd all stare at him mystified and marcus would try to explain how the damned man was destroying the ancient sanctity because that was his thing to demystify unravel explain according to his own limited prosaic criteria the essentially inexplicable demolishing mythology dispelling atmosphere stealing the energy and giving nothing back except money marcus delivering his side of the argument in two successive issues of the phenomenologist why the ludicrous university of the earth would ultimately be a bad thing for the area leaving copies lying around pinning up the article on the village noticeboard with the exception of amy at the tup the villagers didnt understand they all thought he was out of his bloody tree and jealous falconers perpetually tanned face flexed and he flashed his white crowns a combative buccaneering smile often seen on his accursed tv programme the informed sceptic challenging the gullible harebrained mystic marcus released the dog and straightened up six inches shorter than falconer two stones heavier ten years older malcolm growled happily you get hold of that bloody thing the soundman backed away protecting his privates he wouldnt know malcolm was all mouth no bite dogs got as much right to be here as you said marcus probably more you couldnt be more wrong about that falconer said smoothly that animal touches me the soundman said ill have the police in have it picked up and put down and you up in court turned on the cameraman i hate the country you never told me thered be any of this shit you said there was no need for personal injury insurance ive got kids patrick marcus falconer said did anyone ever tell you what an offensive little man you were youve been here approximately half a minute youve disrupted my shoot upset my crew falconer marcus stared him in the eyes you have lived here less than six bloody months in that short time you have offended every one of my most basic sensibilities sensibilities falconer shook his head pityingly god preserve us marcus advanced on him turned the whole valley into a sodding film set everywhere i go there you are doing one of your inane piecestocamera on the psychology of neolithic person as though the whole bloody stone age is your bloody backyard well falconer said at least my version of prehistory is based on knowledge as distinct from wishful thinking but i really dont have the time to discuss the nonsense of ley lines with an old fart whose opinions are irrelevant anyway so bollocks you dont really know any more than the rest of us youre just a bloody academic vampire a leech marcus stopped knowing he was losing it falconer was laughing roger the cameraman said he looked about twentytwo and petulant just look at that sun will you were missing my shot oh dear marcus snarled youre missing the little turds shot falconer stopped laughing there was clearly a real possibility they wouldnt be able to video him with the sun beaming out of his head not today anyway oh bloody dear all right old chap the great man stretched a stiff arm at marcus run along out out marcus stood his ground out of the district out of the country who the fuck do you think you are all right ill tell you who i am falconers face hardened i am the owner of black knoll there was a moment of ghastly silence as the words hit marcus like an anvil and all the breath went out of him before disbelief set in rubbish thats rubbish balls you you cant just buy an ancient monument even you of course i can and the land it stands on thats impossible marcus felt weak couldnt be true the jenkins brothers knew how much he wanted the knoll knew hed get the money together one day contracts were exchanged yesterday at four pm in hereford falconer pausing to savour the reaction the jenkinses are very happy indeed at the thought of getting rid of a useless scrubby little mound without having to sell the meadow as well if youd like to see the paperwork marcus call in at my office at cefnybedd on your way down but marcus couldnt summon the breath his chest felt tight as a bloody drum wait till he saw the jenkins brothers fucking traitorous bastards why because i like the bloody thing marcus because i want to study it in peace because the university of the earth really ought to have its own ancient site where my people can carry out their experiments uninterrupted by their experiments this is a bloody shrine falconer passed a hand across his eyes tottered theatrically bacton people like you astonish me you have the credulity of small children anything bizarre anything determinedly unscientific like the fantasies of some deluded pubescent brat back in the twenties its people like you marcus brandished a finger at him who hounded that child out of the village and one can only be thankful marcus that there werent people like you around to canonize her marcus thought suddenly of mrs willis her recent unprecedented tiredness her headaches his stomach went cold you dont understand anything do you its a healing place thats why it was sited where it is to channel solar energy sure sure just one of the theories well be putting to the test scientifically with a view to disproving it and meanwhile what about the people who come up to draw on the energy marcus felt his lip tremble picturing mrs willis making her way here in the dark increasingly unsteady but determined knowing that the return journey would be so much lighter balls falconer said ive never heard such complete balls roger ill be right with you patrick marcus bacton is leaving and hes not coming back in future and im making this clear now in front of witnesses hell not be welcome on this site oh im sure youd bloody love to stop us coming here but you know you cant so oh i can marcus its not a public right of way when we install our fence fence fence hed bring mrs willis up here in defiance of the bastard but how could he lift her over a fence you dont know what youre fucking doing im fully cognisant of my legal position anyone wishing to visit black knoll will require permission which in most cases if were not working here will be given between the hours of nine am and six pm his narrow allegedly handsome face flushed with triumph falconer waited for the significance of this to dawn as it were on marcus you bastard marcus whispered you utter crass bastard falconer flicked a contemptuous hand at him walked off and went to stand by the burial chamber too late patrick not if were quick said the cameraman marcus turned abruptly away so they wouldnt see the tears in his eyes his jaw quaking sensing his distress malcolm kept close to his legs as he made his way down from the knoll he cant marcus told the dog he fucking cant the rising sun full in his face for annie davies the sun had come down and appeared to roll along the ground between the hills a great glowing ball just rolling in total silence but also vibrating shimmering and if that animal happens to shit on my land falconer called after him clean it up would you old chap v the sky was boiling over a finger of lightning prodding almost languidly out of the deep dark sweating clouds as if it was attached to the arm of a vengeful god there was a flock of sheep several already struck down a heavy tumble of bodies milkeyed heads flat to the plain a few yards away the shepherd lay dead his dog back arched howling a pitiful protest at the heavens terror death and only the great stones in their element whitened as if they were lit from within by electric filaments the stones exulted in the lightning energy the horrific energy of death the sky boiled over and yet it was cold so cold all through the night he cowered in terror on the plain as the frigid lightning struck and struck again like a white snake sister andy had hardly slept feeling close to feverish and in the morning when she ought to have been totally clappedout she felt stronger and years younger there was a polish on the world the colours were brighter very much like the time when she herself was cured what was this saying to her dont dwell on it at the best of times sister andy was ever a fatalist it cannae last hen coming on nightshift she dumped her bags in the office and went straight to find jonathan so how is he tonight your miracle jonathan beamed at her he wakes up he looks bemused he drinks half a cup of tea and he goes back to sleep hes fine hes restored all our faith andy shook her head looked down at her hands all worn and scoured the texture of grade four sandpaper something moved in mysterious ways he saying much not a great deal its a bloody miracle he can even activate his lips four minutes gone jesus god maybe it just seemed like four minutes jonathan said we were all a little hysterical i dont think so jonathan theyd all be backtracking now of course the paramedics saying maybe we were wrong maybe he was alive when we brought him in debbie barnes saying maybe he wasnt flatlining three minutes plus well it couldnt have been that long could it or hed have come round as a cabbage you could turn him into coleslaw and he wouldnt notice you think it was mass hysteria jonathan i think it would be a black day for all of us if you were to leave sister andy aw andy turned away embarrassed it really wasnae me yknow he was blinking at her with the undamaged right eye the left eye would take a while to clear it looked like the raf symbol circles of red white and blue but not necessarily in that sequence shed been there the first time the good eye opened and there to hear the first word hed spoken when against all the medical precedents she could recall his brain broke surface hed said cold which was how andy had been feeling entirely convinced theyd lost him the way the sun turned black fast as a shutter coming down over a camera lens how you feeling bobby strange he blinked some more they had him in a side ward on his own there was always a small risk something they mightve missed so jonathan wanted to hold on to him until tomorrow when theyd wheel him up to the mens ward for a few days bedrest observations tests andy touched her fingertips together in slightly cautious wonder she couldnt let him go to the mens ward yet something very strange had happened here it would never make it onto any report the suits would see to that but hang on bobby said its sister andy isnt it she went to sit on the bed his eyes were open again nothing wrong with the memory then son i can still smell cocoa he smiled all lopsided a boxers smile the day after the fight some fight he fell asleep again and the smile died on his lips it had looked textbook the way hed come out of it a long sleep a few words another long sleep the usual questions whos the prime minister bobby neville chamberlain hed said grumpily and gone directly back to sleep hed seemed annoyed at being wakened not quite textbook cold hed said that first time everybody amazed at his coming out of it enough to make a sound let alone speak a recognizable word then hed coughed and rolled his head this way and that on the pillow and thered been a bit of a panic in case he was somehow choking on dust or something hed made small dry spitting motions with his mouth before subsiding into an uneasy sleep andy had hung around and watched and listened staying on for nearly two hours after her shift had finished sitting beside his bed talking to him softly making notes of the things he said concluding that something well outside the textbook parameters had happened to him during the minutes of his death every word hed spoken shed written down more or less verbatim in shorthand feeling it was important somehow rushing down cold tunnel flushed into the street everybody stuck in a smog dont care dont want to get out of it faces all squashed and smeary stocking masks walking coma streets all grey and icy people passing you either side they dont see you no feeling of being here no feeling of being bus tyres sucking at the slush slops over the kerb onto your shoes february its all february all february and once hed woken up and said quite lucidly dont let riggs in shortly before midnight andy was finishing a cup of cocoa when bobby maiden appeared at the door of her office jesus god andy said gave me the fright of ma life he stood there shaky in just pyjama bottoms sweatshine on his face and chest eyes all over the place lets go back to bed shall we bobby wham i doing here slurring his words as she led him back to bed brainstem damage youre in hospital you were in an accident telling him again because they forgot things very rapidly head injury cases yesterday hed asked if liz was ok if shed survived the accident which ward was she on could he go and see her but the next time he woke up he knew well enough that they were divorced shouldnt be here bobby said shouldnt be here she held back the sheets for him you can say that again son its cold he said and wouldnt get into bed stood there looking confused a warm enough night but it was the first day of october and the autumn heating was on too one economy the suits hadnt got round to yet look he said can you just answer me one question do ma best son am i fully awake looks that way to me andy said but youve got me on drugs right sedatives who told you that nobody i dont think it just feels its no true bobby youre not on any kind of medication last thing wed do in your state all you needs sleep he put a hand over his eyes somebody say i died i dream that no she sat on the edge of the bed patted it for him to sit down next to her wasnae a dream you snuffed it right enough for four whole minutes a long time but you came back thats a hell of a hold on life you got there son he seemed to find this momentarily amusing andy said tell me would you did you have any distinct kind of dreams how do you mean like lights you see anything like that bobby bright lights at the end of a tunnel not that i can remember colours too dark too cold for colours have i been to another hospital you havenae been anywhere bobby as such then why were they rushing me back that would be the night they brought you in you remember that no this was daytime thick fog but it wasnt quite night frozen mucky slush like february you said that soon after you came round maybe it was in your head when whatever it was happened you dont remember being anywhere you know warm no he looked puzzled this is not right bobby can you think back for me whats the first thing you can remember when i mean do you remember the accident no too quickly but she decided not to push it what do you remember before this slushy streets episode his eyes flickered can you tell me bobby he bit his bottom lip fear did you say fear and cold cold fear what were you afraid of he thought about it for a few seconds like the fear was an entity in itself didnt have to be because of anything finally he said i think not waking up never getting out out of what andy said gently what were you in that you were scared of not getting out of was it like a claustrophobia type of feeling she saw he was shivering he put his hands to his eyes im sorry bobby get into bed ill bring you some cocoa but by the time she was back with the cocoa he was asleep in the deep of the night he awoke again and they sat side by side on the edge of the bed with the bulb of the anglepoise turned to the wall and they drank cocoa like old times she asked him if there was any pain only a kind of numbness he said down the left side do i have a fractured skull anything like that youll have to see a neurologist to get it hard and fast might be a hairline but i dont think so theres some brainstem damage whats that mean neural its what causes the numbness the way your voice is slurring and why you wont be walking a straight line for a wee while theyll repair themselves the nerves in time meantime youll keep forgetting things and you wont be able to think as fast as youd like or do things as efficiently so take a breath before you jump in and no offence i tell this to everybody you need to watch your temper meantime relax you were luckier than i can tell you you were gone a good long time according to the rulebook you shouldnae be back at all no way know what im saying i died hed have forgotten their earlier chat this was normal aye you did you were gone quite a while lucky man eh you think so not sounding too convinced oh this is all wrong andy thought this is perversely wrong how long am i going to be banged up in here way youre coming along you could be out in a week long as theres no complications but we do need to watch you all you have to do bobby is rest rest and rest anybody to look after you at home girlfriend mother died when i was a little kid got knocked down in our lane oh runs in the family bobby said getting knocked down im sorry you you still dont remember what happened to you bobby shook his head with a wisp of a smile then he pushed the heels of his hands into his eyes for a long moment something shed seen him do several times before why you keep doing that with your hands its he hesitated then talked about there being a kind of thick glass screen between him and everything he perceived a sense of separateness like youre not part of whats going on bobby maiden looked at her out of his red white and blue eye she was feeling her way here going with the instincts but she had his attention and theres something you think you ought to be able to get through to because you have a feeling you could before dont look so surprised bobby ive been in this game a good long time its normal its no exactly normal ive known it before with patients who you had many like this people who died and came back aye and people who came close to it and then came back most of them she looked into his eyes most of them said it was the most wonderful thing ever happened to them thinking back to some of the patients shed had whod died or almost on the table and come back nothing as dramatic as bobby no more than a few seconds most of them but aye the same story with a few variations maybe seeing themselves lying on the operating table then often a bright light more glorious than anything theyd ever seen or imagined sometimes green fields and lovely gardens with fountains and the famous long tunnel the umbilicus one end in this life the other in chemicals most neurologists were agreed that this was brain chemicals the more optimistic of them suggesting there was obviously some shutdown mechanism in the brain that was triggered by the death process the brain turning on the soft lights and sweet music departure lounge stuff and when they came out of it the world could seem for a short while a hard bright and fairly brutal place maybe bobbys slushy february streets had covered that aspect and yet for almost all of them there was this lingering memory of the glorious light something theyd hold on to the rest of their lives more than a hope a certainty that everything in the end would be very much ok while this guy whod had more opportunity than any of them to bask in the paradise vision bobby are you religious at all well he thought about it kind of knocks it out of you being in the job was it ever there he did it again with his hands palms squashed into the eyes must surely hurt him to do that maybe that was what he wanted pulling his hands away he looked like a child waking up in the middle of the night and finding itself not in its cosy room but on some bare hillside i was never that scared of death scared of dying maybe but thats how most people are i suppose dyings usually no that bad these days andy said any nursell tell you that i am now what scared shitscared dont know where the hell you go but im buggered if im going back i mean ok i realize one day but oh shit the tremble was so prolonged it was like his skin rippled bobby let me get this right andy felt cold just looking at him got the feeling it was only the separateness caused by the slight brain damage that was stopping him from turning into a basket case this has left you with a fear of death his face was so white his bad eye was like a target in the snow listen he said i dont even want to think about it vi marcus couldnt face going back to the castle breaking the news to mrs willis so he walked walking the rage out of his system each step grinding falconers smug face into the tarmac all the way to ewyas harold damn near six miles mrs willis wouldnt be worried when he didnt turn up for breakfast used to his ways perhaps shed go back to bed hope so on the way back fatigue dragged marcus into a field and he sat down under a tree wiping the rain and sweat from his nose and his glasses watching the clouds leak malcolm wandered around picking up the ghost trails of rabbits and foxes and badgers marcus leaned his head against the tree trunk nobody would understand what it would mean to him not being able to walk to the knoll along that very obvious ley line from the castle to watch the sun rise over the distant malverns feeling there a sense of home that hed never experienced before throughout his career as an english teacher in four different schools hartlepool to truro all through his marriage not that thered been anything wrong with that only wished thered been more of it but celia had died not three years after sally following a bloody hysterectomy and nobody would convince marcus that one death hadnt led directly to the other it should not have been fucking incurable bloody doctors and bloody priests and bloody politicians and professional academics and bloody lawyers and judges and television pundits and all wouldbe shapers and organizers of other peoples bloody lives and teachers yes all right bloody teachers too when theyd offered early retirement hed snatched the money and run with it run away ending up faintly bewildered in herefordshire where he was born thinking there was still in theory time to do something to push back the boundaries of life and yet depressingly aware that his life had actually shrunk after no more than a month this melancholic and aimless existence in a rented cottage had been interrupted by news of the sudden death of the latest proprietor of the phenomenologist putting the venerable periodical once more on the market seemed like a sign god knows he needed one been a contributor to the phenomenologist for years smudgy illprinted rag following him around the country arriving four times a year familiar handaddressed buff envelope like pornography editorial pages entirely selfgenerating with unpaid correspondents submitting garbled accounts of mystical and paranormal events in their particular towns and villages appallingly written most of them but after thirty years as an english teacher hed sort that out envisaging a new phenomenologist better layout certain literary style on sale in newsagents and bookshops only after hed bought the centuryold title for a suspiciously reasonable four thousand seven hundred quid had marcus discovered that contributors and subscribers were broadly speaking the same people if you rejected or even rewrote some piece of crap its author would immediately cancel his or her subscription bloody nightmare only way to keep it going was to print every blasted thing and never ask questions very little of it bore serious scrutiny you would never for instance have imagined so many elderly english spinsters manifesting stigmata and the circulation dropped as they died off but struggling with the magazine had for a time given him a purpose also a solid excuse to indulge his longsuppressed passion for the unexplained if he heard of a poltergeistinfested house or the sighting of baffling lights in the sky he could wander along and investigate presenting his credentials noone had ever heard of the phenomenologist of course but it did sound rather impressive and few people would shut their doors in your face marcus bacton crusader for the curious defender of the irrational and annie davies had been his bernadette his joan of arc marcus realizing from his own researches that the circumstances of annies vision were remarkably similar to those of several famous sightings of the virgin notably at fatima in portugal in and medjugorje in yugoslavia as recently as the s he also subscribed to the theory that many socalled burial chambers oriented as they were to the midsummer or midwinter sunrise were not only neolithic calendars but initiation chambers for the priests and shamans theyd spend the night in meditation inside the chamber and then dawns first rays would enter like molten gold through a slit in the carefully positioned portalstones out of the darkness into the light a supremely transcendent experience a time for visions a time for miracles shouldve been saint annie it was an obsession and when the decrepit castle farm the old home of annie davies arrived on the market it seemed like another sign to buy it marcus bacton had cleaned out his bank account and sold his car at least it had a little cottage attached which he could let out for holidays enabling him to afford a series of cleaners who had found him so exasperating that none lasted more than six months until just over two years ago the one who became a livein housekeeper the extraordinary mrs willis all a bit handtomouth but hed always known that one day hed raise the money to buy the knoll and hed have a display case behind glass so that visitors would be able to read the story of annie davies and the vision which the church denied fucking falconer marcus smacked a fist into the ground and badly grazed a knuckle on a protruding tree root his eyes watered he bound the hand with his handkerchief called malcolm and trudged back to the castle through the thickening rain the greypink ruins were draped around the farmhouse which was built on the edge of the original motte half of a tower stood next to the house like a smashed grain silo most of the castles in the area were reduced to this no great kudos to owning one unless you were an outrageous selfpublicist like falconer the listed buildings people were always on your back and the tourists idiots who simply couldnt believe that there could be medieval castle ruins not open to the public so when marcus saw from a distance the vehicle parked in the shadow of the outer curtain wall his hackles rose faster than malcolms he was in no mood to explain to some cretinous family that no there wasnt a bloody ice cream stand however the vehicle under the wall turned out to be a land rover which suggested a local person possibly a patient the castle was remote enough from the village for most of mrs williss patients to come by car or it could be the doctor well god knows he had no time for these bloody stateregistered drugdealers especially after their fumbling failure to save celia but the local fellow was less offensive than most and after all you didnt have to go along with what they prescribed perhaps mrs willis had seen the sense of it healer heal thyself wasnt always the best philosophy stepping into the hall he heard voices from the healing room must be a patient mrs willis wouldnt embarrass the doctor by having him examine her amidst her pots and jars of natural potions dammit she wasnt fit to see patients but what could you do what could you do with mrs willis marcus tramped into the kitchen dumped the kettle on the rayburn shed laid out his mail in a neat pile on the old pine table he hooked out a wooden chair with his foot phone bill and two letters from phenomenologist correspondents he recognized the cramped handwriting of miss pinder the crazed spiritualist from chiswick the other was a foolscap envelope postmarked pembrokeshire sure he knew the writing but he couldnt quite place it he sighed and slit the envelope with a butter knifedear mr bactonwell its been some months since youve heard from me but ive been away i trust you are staying out of trouble with the ancient monuments people over the state of your castle perhaps i shall see it one day now i know you are a busy man so i shall contain my celtic urge to gabble on and come straight to the point there is a pressing matter with which i hope you may be able to assist me we have a murderer in our midst what the bloody hell now theres melodramatic isnt itbut before you dismiss it in that delightfully brusque way of yours as delusion please peruse the enclosed cutting oh god marcus closed and opened his eyes cindy the bloody shaman reached for a mug with his left hand holding the shelf in place with his right insane theatrical biddy who lived in a caravan in pembrokeshire only the word delusion kept him reading falconer had used deluded in connection with the blessed annie davies hate to think that anyone even cindy the bloody shaman might have cause to consider marcus bacton as smallminded as falconer and so naturally i was most distressed by young marias death and would have been only too relieved if the police had identified some local yob as the perpetrator of the crime yet it was clear to me from the first that it was not going to be so easy i could not stop thinking about the death of william rufus as explained so well by dr margaret murray in her wonderful book which i am sure you have on your shelves of course classic work murray had identified william as the divine victim a king dying for his country the ultimate human sacrifice but only cindy the shaman could equate the historic slaying with the murder of a hunt saboteur some eight hundred years later here i felt was a killer with a strong sense of earthritual and the only proof i required for myself was evidence that this person had struck again i began to monitor the newspapers searching for any death that could be strongly linked to its location crimes committed in places of ancient significance wherever i travelled i scoured the local papers for details that the national press would not have the space to include i came across the attached report in the west wales edition of the western mail marcus unfolded the cutting bike boy maimed in horror trapa yearold boy was in hospital with horrific facial injuries last night after riding his motorcycle into a brutal barbedwire man trap on a lonely midwales hilltopa police investigation is under way to find out who stretched a double strand of the wire between a fence post and a tree across a track regularly used by motorcycle scramblers schoolboy scrambler gareth wigley rode round a blind bend and directly into the wire surgeons are fighting to save his left eyea dyfedpowys policespokesman said he is very lucky to have survived this was a calculated attempt to maim or even killsome local people have protested that the ancient track in the elan valley near rhayader is being destroyed by weekend scramblers and the injured boys father farmer bryn wigley said some of these socalled conservationists are completely insanethe track said to have been used by medieval monks walking between the abbeys of cymhir and strata florida the last lines were highlighted with what looked suspiciously like yellow greasepaint between the text and a photograph of the angry father holding a strand of barbed wire the western mail had provided a little map showing the exact location of the trap on the edge of an oak wood a line had been drawn across it in black eyebrow pencil and cindy had scrawled get out your os maps mr bacton all right nobody dead this time but if it had been a grown man on that bike the wire would have had his head off no question the tin kettle shrieked on the stove just about echoing what was going on in marcuss head was he really supposed to print this creepy womans fantasies the miss pinders would think the phenomenologist had metamorphosed into the bloody news of the world with the noise of the kettle he almost missed the discreet creak of the healing room door across the passage dived to the door just in time to spot the young chap with tousled tawny hair moving pretty damn silently for someone with such a hefty physique trying to creep out unseen bloody hell marcus was out of his chair the schoolmaster in him exploding to the surface you boy the outgoing patient stopped come here marcus demanded the face came round the kitchen door looking stupidly embarrassed ah mr bacton its you who the fuck you think it is this is where i live ah yes course it is sorry what the hell do you think youre doing in my house sent you to spy has he well actually adrian fraserhale falconers resident boy scout shuffled about in the kitchen doorway i came to consult mrs willis i have this sort of skin problem and the lady in the pub said skin problem fucking thick skin problem if you ask me no its a sort of psoriasis the boy turned sideways and pulled his collar down revealing an area of pink and white blotches from the ear to the top of the neck itches frightfully god save us marcus raised his eyes to the wormridden oak beams the rash was probably the remains of adolescence young fraserhale had the body of a man and the air of a sixthformer the sort who was a natural captain of the first fifteen but lacked the dignity to make head boy actually roger doesnt know im here i dont suppose hed be awfully pleased i mean ive been to the doctor and a couple of chemists and they all go on about allergies and elimination tests which could take you know yonks meanwhile the thing just grows like some sort of alien lichen and well roger wasnt too keen on me appearing on the box looking like this oh good heavens no mustnt have anyone epidermically challenged on the roger falconer programme and the lady in the pub told me how mrs willis had cured her of a fairly vile rash so yes all right i get the picture the boy was so painfully sincere it was hard to imagine how he managed to work with falconer fraserhale said i didnt mean to be surreptitious or anything no all right just the old girl gets tired shes not young and while she might think shes pretty fit im trying to discourage people from just turning up marcus stopped talking and waited for fraserhale to go but the boy just stood there looking uncomfortable and fingering his psoriasis actually mr bacton if i could just say i mean what happened this morning and the bad feeling between you and roger im really frightfully divided about all that because you know im rather more on your side of the fence than his and i think youre absolutely right about black knoll high knoll yes of course i think it was probably the pivotal terrestrial powercentre for this whole area i mean one only has to spend time there put ones hands on the stone so im well i i think rogers wrong to fence it off and try to keep it for himself i just wanted to tell you that well its er good to know that youre not all tarred with the same brush over at cefnybedd a thought struck him you didnt tell mrs willis about what happened this morning did you oh dear adrian fraserhale looked bereft im so sorry mr bacton you see i thought youd have already told her no said marcus im afraid i was in a bit of a state wanted to walk off the er before i broke the news im terribly sorry not your fault i suppose i was avoiding it fuck mrs willis liked to rest after a healing session so marcus waited half an hour before popping his head around the door all right old love she was lying on her daybed a copy of her beloved peoples friend by her side sorry he said inadequately i mean you know i knew there was something when you didnt come back her face creasing activating a thousand wrinkles the old dear had started to look her age almost overnight it was frightening i really am sorry marcus said perhaps its all my fault perhaps if id got down on one knee to the fellow from the start im going to talk to the county council anyway he cant bar that footpath he doesnt own the meadow and there must be some way we can stop him fencing it off it doesnt matter said mrs willis it doesnt matter this was how shed been for nearly a week not bothered about anything pale listless dried up etiolated noone who saw her now would even recognize the bustling widow whod turned up at the door having come by bus and walked over a mile after his advertisement for a cleaner cleaner ha much later marcus had discovered that the crafty old soul had made a few inquiries about him discovered that here was a retired man with no practical skills to speak of but an undying interest in the mysterious and a house that was far too big for him lots of room for jars and potions dont do this to me old love marcus said you know it matters like hell that you wont be able to go to the knoll remembering how unutterably moved hed been when hed introduced her to the knoll when shed stood by the burial chamber in silence taking several long slow breaths before declaring that he was right it was special it had a healing air and by god she knew how to use it how to focus it and channel it and pass it on look at the anderson woman i never told you mrs willis said in that dreamy way she sometimes had but i saw a black light you saw what what remained of the english teacher in him restrained itself from pointing out that you couldnt actually have a black light this was no time for bloody semantics tell me old love he said when was this whats that when when did you see this last thursday night would it be you went at night you shouldnt be going out at bloody night i didnt see you go mrs willis smiled the old sweet smile youre a sound sleeper boy at night i dont understand bewilderment and panic jostling one another in his chest whats going on bloody hell mrs willis thats why youve been off colour is it not been much of a housekeeper have i forget that jesus christ marcus sorry look just tell me this black light what dyou mean a black light how can you see a black light at night what are we talking about here was it some premonition about falconer why did you see fraserhale what did he tell you whats going on mrs willis just sat there with her back to the matchboard wall and the rickety shelves supporting the old ladys herbs and potions in jam jars and ancient marmite pots falling apart said mrs willis wryly following his eyes what did you do for young fraserhale whats that fraserhale falconers lad that boy i said id make him some ointment i advised hot baths in epsom salts and told him to boil his meat first its only a rash pity you cant poison his bloody boss never say that mrs willis said sternly itll come back on you boy id swing for that man she observed him shrewdly through her pebble glasses youre saying i shouldnt treat that boy because he works for a man you dont like i would treat mr falconer himself if he was in need youre a bloody saint mrs willis and unfortunately im never going to reach your stage of spiritual development id push the bastard off a cliff i mean why is he doing this to us is it just bloody spite because ive been slagging him off in a little sodding rag nobody ever reads perhaps you should be grateful to him for fencing it off whats that mean what dyou mean by a black light a sense of evil for christs sake old love thats what the church tried to say when the child had her vision ive spent years trying to knock all that on the head is that what you mean im tired mrs willis picked up her peoples friend i think i shall finish my story vii the minute she reached home grayle dived at the answering machine as she did every night in case there should be a message from ersula god grayle im so sorry time just goes so fast when youre absorbed in research i looked at the calendar and i just couldnt believe it was six whole weeks since i wrote can you forgive me this never happened the only message tonight was a fax from her sometimesfriend rosita new yorks number one new age publicrelations consultant scrawled around an invitation to the opening of a new store called the crystals cave where our experts will unite you with the mystic gemstone thats been waiting for you and you alone since the beginning of time grayle crumpled it there were crystals on the bookshelves a crystal on the tv two crystals by the phone quartz and amethyst for opening the psychic centres tigers eye for confidence in health onyx for concentration there was the treeoflife wallchart above the sofa a poster of the great pyramid at sunset behind the tv a small buddha served as a doorstop and under the window a threefoottall plaster statue of the egyptian doggod anubis wore a diamante poodle collar hey just because you believe in this stuff grayle would tell visitors you dont have to be too serious about it the principle difference between grayle and ersula five years and several epochs apart tonight the crystals looked dull there was a chip out of the buddha she hadnt noticed before also anubis looked so resentful in his poodle collar that she took it off detective olsen well screw him grayle finished off half a bottle of californian sparkling wine which had gone flat in the refrigerator drinking it from the bottle like beer figuring that by now the entire nypd must have been officially notified that holy grayle underhill was a dopedup neurotic who should be handled with iron tongs so the prime theory here ms underhill is that your sisters been kidnapped do we have any kind of ransom communication no ok lets consider the other option murder do we have a body let me in the first instance ease your mind on this score i persuaded my lieutenant to allow me to call up three police forces around the area you say your sister was last seen i faxed them all a description plus the photograph you gave us and none of them appears to have a jane doe bearing any physical resemblance whatsoever to this person so where does that leave us it leaves us with a highly educated independent and apparently headstrong twentyfiveyearold woman who for reasons unknown has failed to communicate with her family for a period of just over one month ms underhill do you have any idea how many women in this city have been on the missing persons register for over one year what grayle in her desperation had done next had been to show detective olsen the letter even the final pages which lyndon had not seen big mistake let me get this right what we are suggesting now is that your sister has succumbed to an insidious mindpossessing force emanating from some stone age burial chamber do i have this right ms underhill tell me have you discussed this with a priest have you attempted to contact your sister telepathically or maybe enlist the assistance of some of the people youre always writing about and like beam down into her next dream tell her to come back home at once have you tried that ms underhill in the refrigerator grayle found another bottle quarter full of stale sparkling wine and she drank that too on the old wine crate she used as a coffee table lay ersulas last letter creased up and stained with doughnut jam from guardis except for the last pages which lyndon hadnt handled grayle do you have smells in dreamsperhaps you do perhaps the olfactory element is commonplace in the dreams of others i just know i do not recall ever being aware of a smell before certainly nothing so horribly powerful as this stench this nauseous allpervading stench of corruption that made my insides contract until i was sure i was going to throw up can you throw up in dreams probably i didnt i sure sweated though grayle sighed in all fairness what else was the guy supposed to say about this in a city drowning in drugs a homicide every hour on the hour he has to get the woman who disappeared into a dream even if he believed in this stuff taking it any further would be putting his precinct credibility so far on the line as to seriously damage his career prospects for years to come it occurred to her that if she were an ordinary member of the public the next person she would probably turn to for advice would be the citys premier mystical agony aunt holy grayle underhill just as in a way ersula had donethe events of the past few weeks have given me i suppose an insight into your continued need to explore the phenomena of the new agei still believe in psychological answers that the truth lies not out there as they say on your beloved xfiles but in here but i confess that my belief system has been sorely tested on this trip i keep telling myself how glad i am that you are not here but the truth is i often wish that you were i suspect that none of this would faze you i recall how some five years ago both rather drunk we watched some stupid old latenight dracula movie together and i saw an all too human sickness in it and was repulsed while you just shrieked with laughter at the gorier excesses and delighted in the possibility of someone actually being undeadsober by then we argued well into the night about the validity and the morality of horror movies most of which you kept insisting were scary fun but also basically religious well i still do not believe in dracula or the possibility of being undead only in the power of the unconsciousand you know something that scares me a whole lot morethe dream experiments both excite and terrify me because while i am prepared to accept and be fired by the possibility that the abnormally high incidence of lucid dreaming at ancient sites may in some part be caused by external geophysical stimuli i know that the substance of those dreams still comes from within and that is what makes me afraid i am afraid of what the unconscious can make us do i am afraid of liberating aspects of ourselves that we are unable to control grayle shivered in the damp heat of a september night in new york city and thought about dracula sure vampires were scary fun which also held out the promise of some kind ok a very degraded kind of immortality like werewolf stories illustrated the possibility of human transformation i swear on my mothers grave he has to shave twice three times so many people who believed this stuff believed grayle underhill had a hot line to the source seventythree letters last week grayle read them all a few would always lead to stories stories scary fun maybe this reflected her level of spiritual development keep an open mind dont go too deep have scary fun grayle drained the bottle turned to the next pagewere instructed not to discuss our dreams for very sound scientific reasons all the recorded dream experiences thousands of them are being fed into a central database for future analysis only then will any correlations be considered it is crucial to the experiment that any influences should be as a result of the geophysical properties of the sites themselves and not from each others dreamsas the place where this experience occurred was not one of the specific sites earmarked for the project i approached prof falconer and asked if i could discuss it with him he was reluctant he said a dream symbol could spread like a virus if not controlled but eventually he agreed and we discussed it over dinner at a local pub i was disappointed with his response but appreciated his reasoning he said that because i went alone to the site no therapeute the experience was inadmissible he also seemed angry that i had checked out the history of the site with a local historian marcus bacton i sent you a copy of his magazine without his permissionnevertheless i regard this dream as the most significant so far and have enclosed my description of it as a connoisseur of scary fun you will no doubt appreciate it although rest assured that if it comes to my notice that any reference to this has made an appearance in your scurrilous column i will toss sibling tolerance to the winds and sue your assok what is remarkable about this dream is that it is the first which for its entire duration directly concerns the site itselfthe site is black knoll also known as high knoll in the black mountains just under a mile from the center it is a neolithic burial chamber in a modestly spectacular setting atop a promontory affording a wide view all the way to the malvern hills where the composer elgar found his inspirationthe only person recorded as having found inspiration here at black knoll about threequarters of a century ago was a teenage girl called annie davies who claimed to have had a vision of the virgin mary this vision accords with the published accounts of such experiences see seward the dancing sun in which the sun itself appears to gyrate or in this case to descend and resolve itself into a robed female figure the story was recounted to me by the aforementioned marcus bacton publisher of that obscure journal the phenomenologist who lives at ms daviess former home castle farm and is in some respects a most alarming personhowever i had found the tale of the unsophisticated country girl charming i was surprised to hear that it had not been well received by the local people at the time and determined to spend a night at black knoll if possible alone for i have found that having done this so many times i now awake with a total recall of the dream experiencei waited until two am when the center was silent adrian magda and i the scouts and guides as roger somewhat patronizingly refers to us sleep in small rooms converted out of the lofts above the old stables so it was easy for me to creep out of the center and make my way along the ancient trackway to black knollit was a threequarter moon so there was light enough and i felt a pleasant sense of adventure as i approached the monument it seemed more awesome by night but i was not afraid finding myself as usual attracted by the silence and loneliness of it i wished more than ever to know its mysteries it seemed to me that an obviously pagan site which could inspire a fundamentally christian vision was a weighty argument for the theory that the hallucinatory experience was directly influenced by the geophysical nature of the site itselfwhat did make my flesh crawl i confess was a scuffling beneath the capstone suggestive of rats of which as you know i am not overfond there was no way i was going inside after that probably wouldnt have been able to squeeze in anyhow the way the middle part of the monument has collapsed so i spread my sleeping bag on top of the capstone i was used by now to sleeping on stone and drifted off quite quicklythe dreami am walking to the knoll you have to cross a beautiful hay meadow it is harvest time now and the bales are stacked in the meadow like small skyscrapers as i wander through the stubbly canyons between the stacks of bales and find the footpath which takes me up into the hills into the sparse ochre moorland grass i am aglow with anticipation will i too have a vision of the holy mother my dreamself i have discovered is a firm believer this shedding of normal academic skepticism i find oddly refreshing like a holiday like becoming you for a while jesus never thought id say that grayles eyes began to prickle it was as if ersula was reaching out to her automatically she closed her eyes pictured ersula with her efficiently cropped blond hair more blond more pure than grayles and her steady watchful almost cold blue eyes slowing her breathing reaching out for ersula nothing it never did work did it especially when your senses were swimming in threequarters of a bottle of stale californian white winei am not aware of it for a while but the temperature must have started to drop as soon as i left the meadow not only that but in what i would guess was direct proportion to this decline the colors are fading some people only ever dream in black and white i guess my noticing this means that i have always dreamed in colorvisibility is also declining because of a thickening mist through which i can see the sun like a pale coin familiar clumps of gorse sprout from the otherwise bare hillside the offas dyke path which more or less marks the boundary between the countries of england and wales is close and in my dreamstate i can sense a converging of separate energies i dont know how else to explain thisi feel lonely suddenly isolated a strange sensation considering that the center itself is ten minutes walk away that the towns of abergavenny and hayonwye and the city of hereford are all less than thirty minutes by car and although my waking self relishes solitude in my dream i wish someone were here with me even that amiable buffoon adrian fraserhale whose enthusiasms tend to be as nonsensical as your ownupon the knoll encircled by a muff of most unseasonal fog it is alarmingly cold english summers can be capricious but this is not the cold of summer i bend and touch the capstone it has a patina like a hoar frost i am feeling depressed about this as i know it was on such a summers day that annie davies had her vision and was enveloped in a kind of rosy warmth there seems little prospect of warmth here nowi lie down upon the capstone a curious sensation let me try to explain itit is as if my dreamself is entering into my corporeal self two aspects of me fusing together there is a quite awesome sense of what i can only describe as hyperreality for example when i touch the stone at my side i feel i am touching a living thing or more exactly putting my hand into a vortex of swirling pulsing energy as though i am being permitted to penetrate the stones molecular structure and it minei open in my dream my eyes my dream eyes oh yes i am fully aware that i am dreamingthe air is hard with cold i am naked by the wayit is now that i sense the smell it smells as if all the rats or whatever they are under the stone have died and rotted it is a stench so utterly abhorrent that i push my nose into the crook of an elbow in disgust and revulsionof what i saw i am still uncertain although as an archeologist i have been present at the excavation of several graves some no more than two hundred years old this is outside my experience and i can hardly bear to think about iti wrote it down at once describing in as much detail as i could what i thought i saw but when i read it back it seemed stupid and nasty and quite unbelievable and i thought what does this say about me what kind of credibility would i ever have again and i thought of you the way you laughed and took it all so lightly when we were watching that filthy movieok here goesawakening when you awake in a dream it becomes a lucid dream remember with a stiff back on the hardest mattress you can imaginelying on my back neck stiff cant move italthough my god how i want to i just want to turn my head away from the suffocating stenchthe night sky is moonlit but full of racing clouds i want desperately to float up into the wild fresh night chase the clouds rushing past the moon torn like rags lacy scarves of vapor lift lift you can do anything in a dream lift floatcant move pain muscles knotted twisted like old lead pipesstench of decay corruption turn awaya night breeze gets in my hair and my stinking bedfellow rattles beside mefinally i am allowed to turn my head turn it oh christ his way into the stink and it fills my throat and we are looking at one another and hes grinning his savage grin his gums have gone his jaws are agape like a trap strands of yellow skin overhang his greenfilmed eye sockets and the white fleshless tip of his nose appears beaklike under the threequarter moonand we lie there side by side shoulder to shoulder his shoulder naked bone where it pokes through the ragged clothing ripped at by the buzzards and the breezehes been dead a long time i guess my companionand i cannot wake uppresumably the dream ends at some point but i do not wake up until morning and when i do i am trembling and drenched in a cold sweat so thick and glutinous it is almost like jello and i am virtually fused to that stonescary fun grayle you tell me grayle found it more chilling each time she read it what was worst was that you would expect ersula to offer a scientific explanation involving hypnagogic hallucinations or some such ersulas predictable answer to stories about people who woke up and saw ghosts in their bedrooms there was no attempt to explain this away its effect on her had been too corrosive grayle picked up the copy of the phenomenologist ersula had sent what a rag badly printed cheap paper no layouts to speak of no wonder it was entirely unknown even to holy grayle still there had to be a phone number in there somewhere shed call up this marcus backhouse or whatever he was called when she was sober viii wiltshire the holy of holies defiled yesterday evening the green man stood before a sixfoot sarsen as it was being examined by people from the national trust a dozen or so tourists and villagers looking on in horror and disgust hed been alerted to the atrocity by the lunchtime radio news and driven at once to wiltshire the county of his birth he drove between the fields where hed hunted learned to shoot snare and gut where hed learned also about the lines of ancient energy which gridded the fields making wiltshire probably the only county in england where all the ground was sacred but the holiest ground of all was avebury perhaps because he grew up in its shadow stonehenge never had the same power for him as the hengevillage in the kennet valley encircled except for the church by a ditch and the remains of the greatest stone age temple in the world the stones of avebury were shaped by the earth herself each is an individual organism here a lion here a human head a fist a gnarled penis a womans pocked and scarred torso and upper thighs with a tightly clenched vulva one can almost see them all flexing pulsing breathing and he wanted immediately to offer a sacrifice however the problem with avebury is the modern community at its heart and the tourists with their children dogs cameras ice creams always people their vulgarity and their ignorance even at dead of night when this act of sacrilege was presumably carried out the affected stones had been covered ignominiously in sacking by the national trust people to hide the abomination dozens of disgusting pseudocabalistic symbols had been scrawled over two of the outlying sarsens in white emulsion and black bitumen paint the megaliths defaced from top to bottom so that when the paint was cleaned off the sensitive skin of mosses and lichens would also be scrubbed away leaving the stones flayed and aching as bald as housebricks who was responsible socalled new age travellers perhaps the itinerant vagrants who live on social security and consider ancient shrines to be their inheritance he was reminded yesterday of the eighteenthcentury farmer who went around massacring megaliths and rejoiced literally rejoiced in the name stonekiller robinson the green man does not know how the stonekiller had died but he hopes it was a long and exceedingly painful death through the sacking he heard the stones calling out to him in their pain and from beneath his feet the earth shrieking for revenge knowing then that he had been sent for that he was to be the instrument parking his car for the night on the outskirts of marlborough he walked to the ridgeway and joined a line from the avebury circle and walked on until he found the place they always turn out to be marked in some way these sacred sites but sometimes the marker is far from obvious and takes time to discover it might be a small stone hidden in a wood or obscured by tufts of moorland grass or lost among buildings because sometimes the place will be in the middle of a village even a large town for instance earlier this year the green man slept in a hollow in the ramparts around an iron age fort contoured into the summit of a holy hill there were pine trees here as well and through his dreams galloped the spectral figure of the knight of swords from the tarot the knight was riding down from a hill with stark pines upon it his sword was raised he was on a mission of vengeance there was no denying the command at first light this day the green man followed an obvious alignment from the hill to a church steeple in the centre of the town below the church was locked the churchyard deserted he walked on the town was empty there was very little traffic following the line he arrived at the stump of an old market cross a familiar marker the line followed a paved pedestrianized area into a small shopping arcade where the frontage of one shop jutted out beyond its neighbours into the middle of the line the shop was an ironmongers the first sign in its doorway was a large cardboard box inside it was a young vagrant the box was not quite long enough to accommodate him so he had protected his feet from the cold by encasing them in another smaller box on it was a linedrawing of a carving knife and one stencilled word meatmaster all the confirmation the green man needed putting down his rucksack in the silent newly cobbled arcade he located the serratededged sheath knife he sometimes used to skin rabbits he remembers how the vagrant awoke with half his throat open that soundless liquid scream again the remains of the barbersurgeon are on display in aveburys small museum the skeleton was found under stone number nine in the henge circle his profession was suggested by the implements discovered on the body scissors and what was believed to be a medical probe the dates on the coins he carried suggested he died in the early s surgeons in those days needed no more qualifications than those required for cutting hair it seems likely that the barbersurgeon was involved in a medieval assault on the stones at the instigation of the christian church attempting to stamp out pagan rituals still carried on there tragically ha he appeared to have died when the stone toppled upon him this is possible there are many tales of foolhardy country people who tried to dig up ancient menhirs provoking thunderstorms even being struck by lightning during his dream below the pines last night the green man learned the truth that the barbersurgeon had been abducted by the guardians of the stones and given in sacrifice bludgeoned to death and placed beneath the stone in his dream the green man was kneeling under the pines in a dense mist which sliced off the tops of the trees he had held out his hands and into them was placed something grey and misty but quite heavy when he awoke he found not fifteen yards from where hed slept a single stone about eight inches long and three to four inches wide this dawn arrives wearing a mist as fine as lace the sun tossed carelessly in its loose folds too bright he will have to thicken the mist this is quite easy most people can learn to do it however most people would do it in reverse they teach themselves to shift clouds and dissolve them by pure concentration a simple example of the way human consciousness can learn to interact with nature with practice the clouds can almost be blown away in seconds pffft actually producing clouds adding density to the atmosphere is more interesting and far more powerful close the eyes imagine create cold in the body this is done initially through the feet the cold drawn up from the dark places of the earth best achieved when standing on stone and sent to the base of the spine to form an icy ball around the spinal chakra slowly the cold is drawn through breathing into each of the bodys seven powercentres and then projected into the aura finally often in a fit of shivering the command is given it is easier at dawn when the sun is vulnerable and unsure of itself from the pines he watches it fade the earth senses the commitment and he feels radiant in her trust the stand of pines on its small hill is surely as old as the great stones three miles to the south this can be felt these trees and generations of their ancestors sturdy and aloof taller than many a church steeple but the power of this site is probably unknown except to the green man they have been priming the place he and the earth through the hours of the night he lying supine under the harvest stars or sitting crosslegged and straightbacked in meditation among the needles and the brittle cones the weight of anticipation kept him awake the certainty that someone would be sent and of course the special energy of the site itself once there was sex his penis summoned aloft by the thrusting pines earthen lips exquisitely cold around it and then came the dream the dream of the barbersurgeon the dream sent to him from the great stones of avebury in their agony the one who has been sent comes in a straight line of course through the mist following the green road between the fields it is almost nine oclock later than the green man expected still the longer the wait the greater the accumulation of energy he feels her moving close to him and his whole body hardens as he stands legs apart among the ancient pines actually this person is not quite what he expected he was envisaging a new age traveller or two two would be a challenge although not much of one when one takes into consideration that element of surprise the man wears a waterproof jacket flat cap and newlooking walking boots he has a small backpack carries a pair of rubbercovered binoculars and an ordnance survey map in a plastic sleeve he looks very respectable fairly intelligent not the sort of person you would expect to deface an ancient monument not your decision not your place to question no of course not good morning the man says cheerfully panting slightly as he reaches the top of the little hill and turns to make a theatrical point of admiring the halfmisted view wonderful they share a smile the green man wonders if he should tell the newcomer what is to happen this would be even more powerful especially if he was able to understand the complexity of it and be proud you are with our lot arent you the man chuckles thought everybody was having a bit of a liein after last night by jove it doesnt take prisoners that real ale does it mind you i find this is the best way to clear your head make yourself get out of bed let the country air get at it beats aspirin does country air our lot the toh he peers at the green man bloody hell youre not are you sorry sorry many apologies theres a collection of us you see from clubs in the north midlands twitchers birdwatchers every year we go to a different county for a long weekend only the first night it always gets a bit convivial demobhappy you see a birdwatcher and one with the garrulous selfimportance of a minor local autocrat council official bank manager or some such a birdwatcher no guts for the kill hes not meant to know he would never understand hes crass an idiot unworthy of the honour of knowledge super day though the birdwatcher sets down his pack and sits on it been camping also a poor specimen not very big not very young not very fit and depressingly unaware used to go in for camping when i was younger my wife and i that is couldnt get her into a tent nowadays dont mean she wouldnt fit although thered not be much room for anyone else i have to say its just he takes off his cap smooths down his hair replaces the cap just that women seem to get older younger than we do if you see what i mean lose their instinct for adventure no spirit on holiday are you know the area well yes he sniffs call ourselves birdwatchers just an excuse really to get away from the wives get some fresh air have a few pints in peace ah well he breathes deeply and closes his eyes sitting on his pack with his knees together his hands clasped around them and at that moment the sun finds a hole in the mist and lays a white beam up to his feet yes feel it feel it rise through the soles of the feet up the backs of the braced legs into the spine out to the shoulders rippling down the arms the wrists the gloved hands behind the back gripping the stone so what do you do the green man asks mildly when youre not birdwatching the eyes tip open youll laugh i run a small chain of ladies hairdressers in wolverhampton and the green man does laugh with the sheer joy of the revelation the fitting of the last segment of a perfect circle he sees a first flicker of uncertainty in the birdwatchers colourless eyes as the little man attempts to rise before the stone crunches his nose like a red pepper his eyes flicker rapidly through an amazing range of emotions outrage disbelief terror and finally pleading he opens his mouth and the green man stops his scream with the stone and the birdwatcher gags on blood and smashed teeth soon there is a quite terrific amount of blood mixed with vomit and it forms a warm delta between the exposed roots of the tallest pine ix he woke up in a dark panic or didnt didnt wake up woke down dreams bunched and knotted behind his shuttered eyes and he couldnt open them couldnt move couldnt scream im paralysed a whizzing a flittering snipping tearing as he awoke again into the cold lying on his back the sky above him alive with dark wings tried to hurl himself away muscles wouldnt respond locked everything inside him got behind a scream but his throat wouldnt process it no lubrication all congealed inside all the liquids in him had clotted and dried when the blood stopped flowing like a corpse like a corpse muscles rotted through torn shredded bits of him pecked away ripped away chewed away blown away and no eyes to see any of it couldnt open his eyes because there werent any eyes you couldnt open bone whimpering he heard whimpering and it was his own whimpering and the clatter of a morning trolley a morning was happening somewhere out there but he wasnt part of it he was out of it he was two days dead he turned his head on the sweatdamp pillow and opened his eyes third awakening always three never trust the first two god help me tea mr maiden bobby andy he was fogged muffled no its sister andys day off ill leave it on the side here then you can have another sleep if you like before breakfast he sat up in panic the words another sleep terrified him no sister andy whod saved his life the african doctor jonathan had told him how they were all ready to give up and shed stood there holding his head demanding they keep going with the defibrillator jonathan describing it all so gleefully that maiden was sure he could remember them coming in like the drug squad on a dawn raid all this down to sister andy left to me man jonathan had said with a frightening shrug theyd be putting you in the ground today recalling the words now with a sense of deep horror he could clearly see himself from above still and bluish eyes closed against the earth coming down on him in spadefuls the first particles of grit drumming on his screened eyeballs closing his mouth against it but suddenly his eyes were opening into a brutal hurting hail of soil and stones he could still taste the soil in the back of his throat he drank all the tea and then two glasses of water from the carafe lay back breathing heavily remembering what andy had said about the patients who returned the soft warmth and the gardens the angelic voices fountains well yeah you read all that stuff saw people talking about it on tv faces uplifted to the lights all very comforting and all crap it ended with the grave that was the truth burial in the earth and death wielding the spade you saw the face of death through fibres and roots and decaying matter and worms still tasting it and oh god he needed to talk to andy you heard it said that saving someones life created a bond a mutual responsibility something was reaching out to this grimfaced glaswegian nurse as if she was his longlost mother no that wasnt exactly it close though close where was she jonathan might know but he wasnt here either there was a different doctor in the unit the tightmouthed officious kind patrolling the beds like a rogue traffic warden peering into the side ward and rasping over his clipboard as though the guy lying there was deaf mute and backward nurse explain to me would you why is this patient still here nobody could explain it and so after breakfast they pulled bobby maiden out of the sometimescomforting chaos of casualty and dumped him in lower severn ward if the side ward in a and e was limbo lower severn was authentic hell continuous daytime tv colours cranked up to luridplus playing to two rows of probably nice enough guys with drips and tubes one bloke preop and nervy one postop and demobhappy one who read the sporting life and kept trying to persuade the nurses to place his bets one who sat on the side of his bed and farted like a moped all these guys maiden saw them in cold rubbery shades of grey their faces squashed into stocking masks a layer of dense depression banked over the beds like industrial smoke sunshine streamed through long windows but the whole place was full of february and there might never be a march according to the book according to andy he should be feeling real joy able to spread some comfort sitting up in bed and glowing with this kind of smug benevolence having died he ought to have been reborn his spirit pulled out of his body and washed clean it felt soiled soiled literally all he experienced was a very tainted kind of relief every time he awoke a temporary relief because one day hed have to die again and death was a sour grave there was an old man in a corner bed they kept pulling the curtains round the sporting life reader shaking his head saying cant be long now and maiden wanting to leap out of bed and scream at the old man for christs sake hold on to every last fucking second the rest of life was going to be tainted by the acrid taste of the grave meanwhile riggs was coming bossll be in to see you vaguely remembering from when he first came round someone leaning over the pillow with sanitized spearmint breath just give us a name somebody we can pull a name bobby dont remember anything remember going home latish nothing after that sorry mike sorry mike mike beattie maiden instinctively lying to beattie riggss man of course he remembered even in and out of consciousness he remembered about blackeyed suzanne and the pictures and the offer and parker and riggs and the filigree of corruption stitched so tightly into the fabric of the town that undoing it would leave the fabric itself in shreds parker and riggs or was it in fact riggs and parker had riggs simply sat back and thought about it and decided reliable old tony was on balance the best man to handle drugs and other essential service industries in elham was riggs in some way the contractor whatever maiden seemed to have been offered a ticket for the gravy train on a climb aboard or be found dead on the tracks basis dead been there been into the big tunnel come out the other side crawled out sick and scared what happens now back down the slimetrails of downtown elham after a while maiden let the whole mess lower severn ward suzanne parker riggs and the certainty of the grave seep sluggishly out of his mind like dirty water down a drain and went into his black swampy sleep awakening unable to move again convinced at first that he was on a trolley in the mortuary his consciousness like a bird caged in his corpse and it would only be free when the electric saw took off his cranium death again he could only ever dream about aspects of death dead people dead sheep violence brutality he actually sobbed with relief when the grey world babbled in so youre a snooker man tom the tv said some daytime quiz programme and how many kids blimey sharon he must keep his cue well chalked maiden jerked in the bed wrapped the hard hospital pillow around his head so youre awake lad the voice coming down like an oak truncheon maiden opened and closed and opened his eyes papers said you was in a bad way dont look that bad to me bloody sight better than i did by god the night i had harry skinner and his lads cornered in the old paint warehouse at wilmslow heh tell you this much they dint look so pretty neither when id finished wi em hello dad maiden said two trains it took getting here had to change at shrewsbury norman plod boots gleaming fusewire hair brylcreemed flat stood in the centre of the ward glaring up and down the lines of beds as if he was scouring a pub for underage drinkers bugger of a place shrewsbury said the sporting life bloke had to get hisself transferred down here to get away from me norman plod said dead accurate for once not fit to be let out this lad heh cant be trusted to cross the bloody road without getting hisself flattened as usual it had taken norman plod less than a minute to collect an audience presence he used to say you have to have presence halfway to respect bet you didnt get his number either did yer no dad maiden said wearily busy dying you know how it is bloody detective this norman plod told the ward bloody detective he could have been a detective could norman cid had been on their knees to him but the public didnt have the same respect for detectives slinking nosing and drinking on duty the public liked a policeman to look like a policeman to have presence maiden noted the absence of grapes sweets bottles of lucozade not even a newspaper his old man never saw the point of little gifts for the sick their duty to get well back to work stop the drip drip drip of taxpayers money into their arms nice of you to come all this way dad im retired lad gardens winding down for winter nowt else on the go they got any leads your clever colleagues poor bloody do you ask me got to be a motor somewhere wi a busted front end listen norman leaned in just the way hed always done as if he was about to confide the secret of life i dont know the background dont know what villains youve put away lately whos got a grudge an i dont want to im retired all im sayin word to the wise tapping his veiny nose just dont whatever you do dont let this one bloody well go dont ever write it off make sure the bugger gets nailed to the bloody wall eh know what im sayin maiden said before he could stop himself youre thinking about mum im thinkin nowt norman lurched back as if his only son had struck him amazing to see the old hostility in his eyes the look that said you never got the car number then either did you lad even though bobby had been not yet three years old when he toddled off the kerb in his pyjamas seven in the morning pushing bonzo the dog on wheels he stared at his dad had norman ever cried hed told maiden once and once only what must have happened that day while he was on the early shift and the road at the end of the garden was no more than a country lane not much traffic but no excuse for the paper lad or the milkman although neither would put his hand up to it to leave the gate open so that the child could get out the inquest had decided the mother must have rushed into the road and pushed the kid out of the way and the vehicle hit her instead ran over her whoever it was never stopped no other drivers in the area until the farmer on his tractor who found the woman dead the child sitting silent and whitefaced in the road beside her hugging a white dog on wheels his hands clenched under the bedclothes everything seemed interconnected two explosive moments in time two hitandrun incidents over thirty years apart two deaths runs in the family getting knocked down as though the same impetus that took away his mother on the outskirts of a scrappy village in cheshire had carried on through time until another maiden had crossed its path in old church street he saw blurred by sudden tears the struggling colours of norman maiden pulsing through the stocking mask of february felt momentarily closer to the concretefaced old cop than he could ever recall thered been no pictures of his mum in the house norman got rid of them all nan who looked after him until she died would bring out a precious photo album when he was older maidens mother had thin brown hair around a pale sweet face small and slender as a waif tiny bones crushed under the wheels of a van it was speculated she was ten years younger than maiden was now theyd never caught the driver which left only one person for norman plod to hang the blame on finally conveying with his usual ironbar subtlety that joining the police was the least the lad could do for his mother too many other drivers out there ready to kill and speed away get em nailed the guilt factor bobby praying at the age of eighteen for something to get him out of this solitary kid no good at team games down on his knees please god i dont want to be a copper dont want to be like him always the feeling that the old man also had some secret guilt something he had to make up to her but there was no chance now because the bloody kid ran out into the lane and got her killed dad listen if any old mysteries were to be solved if anything was going to be said any healing process begun it would have to be now no you listen lad the peace process was probably doomed but it never got started anyway because that was when riggs walked in x and it was wrong it was so damn wrong everything was wrong up early her day off andy had hit the henna and when it was all done and dried off damn if she didnt look totally ridiculous red hair was a statement all she had was a string of questions shed bought the stuff on her way home from work on that first morning in the flush of the excitement over bobby maidens diaphragm going gloriously up and down it was a confirmation irrational though it seemed the combination of a rising sun and an old ladys wisdom had brought out the healer in her two miracles in her life now shed been just dying to ring marcus bacton give it a couple of days shed decided in the end let the euphoria settle it cannae last hen and it hadnt something completely wrong hed come back sure enough but did he act like he wanted to be back did he hell hed returned confused and unhappy and with a lingering fear of death which was outside andys experience there should be a feeling of triumph hed been through it the death experience been through it and out the other side with no more than a probably temporary brainstem problem he should at the very least be feeling vaguely relaxed about the idea of death so it has to be me i blew it maybe now was the time to call marcus andy dragged on her ancient housecoat sat on a corner of her bed with the cordless the phone had that distant rickety ring what she thought of as a rural ring it wasnt getting answered most likely mrs willis was there on her own she was going a wee bit deaf and didnt like to answer the phone even if she was aware of it ringing the snarl came as she about to hang up yes marcus andy coming on cheerful andy anderson how are you both today bloody hell woman im trying to make an omelette soon as i break an egg into the bowl some bastard rings call back later shall i about two no damn it dont do that no please im sorry stay where you are i was going to ring you anyway is mrs willis no too well marcus was no cook ah not terribly andy said cautiously whats wrong oh spot of blood pressure she has a day in bed now and then quaffs a few potions oh christ lowering his voice to not much more than a hiss i dont know whats fucking wrong well i do jesus god marcus damnation hold on a minute anderson sounds of clanking pans oaths a sixtyyearold man fending reluctantly for himself a force of nature marcus bacton nature was a real presence around the village of st marys you were always aware of its closeness and of the miraculous lying awake after the bobbymiracle shed relived the other one feeling again the absolute rockbottom weakness the alarming weight loss the cramps the red lumps on her legs the hair falling out and the endless endless journeys to the lavatory to release more blood and mucus into the bowl four barium enemas in as many months and three different drugs stress they said as she herself had said to dozens of other colitis sufferers the stress of the job and the finding out about micks fancy woman then the drugs werent working any more and xrays showed her gut was in one hell of a mess which was when this schoolmistressy lady had been brought into the general after falling from her bike andy dealing less efficiently than usual with the sprained ankle provoking the comment you look as though you could do with a long rest my dear before they wheeled the lady away shed pressed an address into andys hand a holiday cottage in the welsh marches not terribly luxurious but wonderfully peaceful except for marcus bacton rampaging around the place but he was just one of the many forces of nature at work in the village of st marys when she arrived she was getting to the stage of hating her own body scared to go out in case she disgraced herself finding herself explaining all this to the housekeeper mrs willis whod knocked tentatively at the cottage door this particular afternoon everything coming out all the selfpity mrs willis just listening never once mentioning alternative therapies as if she knew instinctively how a nursing sister was going to react to that old rubbish but would mrs anderson perhaps like to come for a walk with her and marcus one morning well mrs willis that would be nice but i have this wee problem about leaving the vicinity of a working lavatory before eleven what time were you thinking five am five jesus god are you mad mrs willis was the kind that just nods and smiles but you know youve ruined her day so that night andy just didnt go to bed stayed up all night drinking coffee chainsmoking going to the lavvy some days you could just live in the lavvy head in your hands a human sewer by four am she was half delirious aching all over they were waiting outside it was painful to pull on her coat and scarf outside it was still dark marcus said dont bloody well blame me mrs anderson whatever the old girl says i dont question it these days they clambered over stiles marcus leading with his torch on the edge of a big field andy was stricken with a leg cramp and fell down rolling on the grass in her agony mrs willis massaging the leg until the lump went down and then marcus picking her up good god woman youre like a bundle of bloody twigs and it occurred to andy that there wasnt much weight left to go she was a living husk the disease finally draining the life out of her and she couldnt even cry about it on account of the parched body wouldnt produce tears any more just before she passed out in marcuss arms she heard mrs willis saying in a matteroffact kind of way inside marcus god knows shes thin enough put her inside the tomb falconer marcus roared in her ear what fucking falconer just one aspect that was not so peaceful the old lady had said but there was no harm in him know what the bastards done fourstrand barbed wire fence five feet high no stiles fucking cunt the degeneration of marcuss language had roughly kept pace with the deterioration of mrs williss hearing i dont understand what fence around the knoll he allowed to do that he owns it hes bought the fucking knoll marcus youre kid he wants his own little burial chamber like other people want a garden gnome hes going to do lots of filming up there for his bloody programme his assistants will be doing their scientific experiments theyll be dowsing it and dreaming on it oh and its closed to the public between are you ready for this between six pm and nine am you mean nobody can go there at sunrise jesus god marcus what about mrs oh no you wouldnt recognize her she wont see a doctor of course but what would a doctor do give her bloodpressure pills how old is she that anderson is one of the big mysteries must be over eighty i was going to take her to the knoll this morning i was sure bloody hell andy i love that place i believe in it i dont give a shit what anybodydid i tell you about the lunatic american woman andy said absently lunatic what she was thinking about mrs willis if i could bring down the sun for bobby why couldnt american woman marcus said this american woman rang me about half an hour ago one of these who talks so fast youre lucky if you can answer one question in three trying to find her sister last heard of working at falconers place i met the girl actually wanted to know about the knoll told her about annie oh aye if i can bring the high knoll sunrise to elham general why cant mrs willis fetch it to the bottom of the hill and of course she was involved in falconers stupid dream survey and so she wanted to sleep at the knoll and i said you know best of luck but dont expect a holy miracle now the girls written to her sister describing this horrific nightmare and oh i dont want to talk about it ive had a bellyful today she told me she saw a black light over the knoll americans are impressionable people marcus no mrs willis a what a black light over the knoll andy shivered clutching the housecoat to her throat i dont know what to do marcus said im at my wits end ok look im coming down you i owe her everything marcus ill talk to the hospital ill get time off ill be there tonight all right thats bloody good of you anderson jesus god its the leasta black light i dont know what she meant either marcus said but it does have an ominous ring of death to it doesnt it xi riggs the boss man turned slowly and looked into space for a moment before inclining his head he smiled with all the warmth of a polecat greeting a rabbit this is my dad sir maiden said norman riggs had a thinner mans face an oddly sensitive face with fine translucent skin you could see tiny veins underneath like the filaments in a light bulb there was something extraterrestrial about riggs you always thought he could read your thoughts and this struck you anew every time you saw him honoured to meet you sir norman hung around like someone waiting to be called into the witness box reading about you the other week now what did i read he pretended to think for a second or two jarvis you nailed terry jarvis i nicked his dad mustve been four times john karl jarvis gbh mostly aggravated burglary once by that were a hard bugger family trait mr maiden sit down ill fetch another chair ill get it sir norman said and he did riggs sat his narrow bony face smiling at norman with its full genial mouth while its eyes remained cool occasionally seeking out normans boy who stayed glazed focused on nothing smiling inanely from his bed playing damaged brain in dry dock attentionspan of a goldfish youre looking a bit blurred bobby riggs said you were lucky so they tell me sir oh before i forget roger gibbs managing editor of the messenger group was asking me about a picture of you recovering as it were perhaps the two of us together i wasnt too happy cooperate with the local press whenever you can always been my motto as you know but in this case a wounded hero picture riggs shrugged well up to you bobby it was also when you were in his presence impossible to believe riggs was bent he always looked fully at you he was always calm one day soon riggs would be promoted and leave elham within three years hed be an acc maybe even a chief constable living a chief constables lifestyle and all of it paid for a cottage here a villa there and tony parker safely retired face to face with riggs you knew he was never going to be nailed he was direct ruthless efficient had important friends but he was also oddly a coppers copper got results but never pinched the credit the lads liked working for him nobody maiden knew would have wanted riggs to go down i was suggesting sir norman said that he should make a list of all the toerags who had it in for him oh riggs lifted an eyebrow you think it was like that do you mr maiden copper gets knocked over its not usually a drinkdriver sir not a drinkdriver riggs pinched his nose what do you think about that bobby i wouldnt know boss would i obviously not you dont remember anything mike beattie tells me unless somethings come through no not a thing how long before youre out few days some nerve damage theyre saying you may be walking around in a bit of a fog for a while should sort itself out boss have to see wont we bobby norman looked at his watch maiden flashed him an imploring glance shit dad dont walk out on me whatever this bastards really come to say i dont want to hear it by heck norman said its nearly five oclock be missing me train surprisingly riggs stood up yes i have an appointment too speaking engagement he made a wry face magistrates association annual dinner just wanted to make sure the lad was all right before i went home can i give you a lift mr maiden very kind of you sir but i like to walk patting his stomach dont let retirement get the better of me thats the spirit well ill see you again bobby thanks for looking in said maiden watching the two of them strolling companionably down the ward smiling at other patients the visit over almost before it had started whats he going to do to me coincidence riggs and maiden had arrived in elham the very same week maiden direct from the met riggs after four months in kent taking over from a dci who was facing allegations of corruption yes he was that hardfaced never thought theyd see each other again after the met but here they were suspicions once when riggs was a di hed sought ds maidens cooperation in fitting up this troublesome animal rights woman for an amateur parcelbomb at a butchers shop in fulham naturally if the fitup had gone ahead it would have been entirely down to maiden riggs merely turning a blind eye this was how it worked or to be honest how maiden presumed it still worked hed never stopped watching riggs and he hadnt got a thing that was rocksolid just the names of four smalltimers fitted up by parkers crew nicked by riggs three of them figured it was safer to let it go do their eighteen months flit to some safer town on release the other was dean clutton whod topped himself on remand you stupid little twat maiden lurched his eyes sprang open norman plods familiar leathery breath on his face norman plod hissing in his ear dad what about your train fuck the train maiden struggled to sit up but norman was leaning over him as if hed just brought him down after a chase no bloody wonder you dont remember owt voice loaded with contempt what did he say to you dad drinkdriver drunk driver put me bloody size nines in it that time didnt i heh drunk bloody pedestrian more like oh shit maiden said a good man is mr riggs a damn good senior officer better than you deserve telling me on the quiet copper to copper save me any more embarrassment all right maiden said id had a few drinks a few drinks you bloody little toerag five scotches and four pints you were lucky you could bloody stand up thats not quite true dad no beers norman looked down on him breathing through his teeth you were in a club called the saint moritz that right maiden said nothing where you picked up a brass not quite right and where you drank five scotches and four pints the barman remembers every one lad because he recognized you then you and the brass left wi your hand up her jumper no you got in a minicab and you went to your flat about an hour later a witness saw you come out chasing tbrass what were up lad wouldnt she take a credit card by christ i always knew you werent up to much i were bloody amazed when you made di bloody amazed dad i thought youd maybe sorted yourself out at one time when you married elizabeth bonny lass woman wi a bit of go in her could you keep her could you buggery youre a dead loss lad a bloody dead loss norman took his weight off maidens chest moved away brushing at his jacket in case bits of his son had come off on him at the foot of the bed he looked over his shoulder sporting life and the farter both watching keenly you left your front door open son norman said with a visible sneer but its all right nobody wanted to nick your pictures the storeroom was full of boxes of paper towels and toilet rolls cartons of soap bleach industrial cleaning fluids all the nonhuman hospital smells began here maiden stayed behind the door as someone went past with a trolley he was sweating his left side had shut down the bluewhite light from the fluorescent tube was squeezing his head like an accordion sister andy had told him you wont be walking a straight line for a wee while take it slowly this was the furthest hed been taken himself to the lavatory and that was it he looked down at his trousers no bloodstains anyway somebody had given the suit a brush there was a hole in his grey jacket below the breast pocket it would do normal thing would have been for the suit to go to forensic always a small possibility of paint traces somebody obviously wasnt trying very hard to find the car that ran him down he still needed a sweater or a shirt the crash team had obviously torn his off in a hurry to get at his chest maybe he could find some kind of surgeons smock in here he had no watch he opened the door a crack to look up at the clock at the end of the corridor fivethirty teatime theyd be missing him soon checking out the toilets and the day rooms could have tried to sign himself out but that would have led to arguments drawn too much attention especially with the state hed been in when not five minutes after normans final exit thered been this sudden activity down the ward and the screens went up again round the old mans bed and there were murmurs the ward darkening the air clotting with death a purplegrey cloud almost visible over that bed maidens stomach had gone cold with dread he had to get out of here out of the hospital out of the town out of the grey out of the cold the need stifling him take a breath before you jump in no hed found his suit in the locker rolled it up into a ball around his shoes made his exit before they removed the body he found the tshirts wrapped in cellophane in a box marked liquid soap the tshirts were white all one size he held one up across the chest it said elham general hospital league of friends fun run maiden put one on his jacket over the top switched off the light and relished the darkness until he realized he was going to sleep even though hed spent most of the bloody day asleep all you have to do bobby is rest rest and rest wondering if he could ever really rest again anybody to look after you at home girlfriend mother liz would have known how to look after him wouldve known all about the care of head injuries but he knew that if hed still been with liz shed have sent him straight back to the hospital in a taxi then told riggs liz liked there to be a framework structure hierarchy organization rules discipline he clutched his head suffocating no wonder norman liked her when the lift let him out in the reception area his legs felt weak the place was full of visitors and cleaners and auxiliaries there was a small shop selling tea and coffee and snacks a few tables and chairs and he sat down for a moment eyes going at once to a framed print on the cream wall opposite he knew the painting turner staffa fingals cave skeletal ship in an angry glowering maelstrom of sea and sky and rocks small struggling sun there was a sudden heaviness in his chest a memory rolling around in there like an iron ball it meant something this picture it had the essence of something he felt its violence the picture was groaning with halfspent violence and the threat of more to come more to come maiden felt sick as though he was on that ship among the black elements couldnt look at it any more stood up didnt hang around didnt look to either side until he was in the hospital car park on the hillside overlooking the town and the dying sun xii shit slamming the flat of his hand into his head an elderly man steered his wife away from the bus stop throwing maiden a glare of disgust bloody drunks hed be thinking bloody drunks on the street before seven oclock thats what you get with allday opening maiden rocked on the kerb hands pushing at his eyes so he was making an exhibition of himself so what hed only left his wallet in the hospital safe so no money not even a few coins for a cup of tea with three sugars he needed the sugar he felt as though his brain was floating out of his skull like a balloon on a string made himself take three deep breaths think ok it wasnt as if he was breaking gaol it was only a hospital he could go back and demand his wallet from the safe except theyd probably know he was missing by now and as he was a policeman who would they tell not worth the risk he wanted to be well away before riggs found out not that even riggs could stop him it wasnt a police hospital and as he was hardly fit for work he could do what he liked go where he wanted anybody to look after you at home girlfriend mother girlfriend no mother no home get back to the flat must be some money there a spare chequebook pack a suitcase take a bus out of town dont even try to drive the car find a hotel sleep sleep sleep then consider stage two he wanted to worry riggs if that was possible make him lose some sleep about where maiden might be who he might be talking to worried people made mistakes one day riggs would have to make a mistake you could only hope somebody would be there to pick up on it maiden started to walk avoiding the town centre slinking into the back streets like a vagrant walking slowly trying not to sway passing people were glancing sideways at him as at some kind of downmarket streettheatre performer the sneering sun hung like a cheap copper medallion he felt naked he tried to run but the pavement came up at him before he even realized hed stumbled slow down it was no more than half a mile to old church street he could manage that oh no please no fuck now he was kicking a lamppost again and again and again fuck fuck fuck because his pockets were empty not only no wallet but no bastard keys he was supposed to break into his own flat shit shit shit where had his mind gone not thinking like a copper any more not even like a human being and hed actually believed he was putting it on for riggs shit he was half vegetable couldnt work out really really simple things he looked wildly around him no money no keys nowhere to go now nowhere to go nowhere to sleep the street swayed his left leg had gone dead he wanted to smash his head into the lamppost again and again and again his useless damaged head he gave the post a final kick its light began to flicker on he backed away in alarm then saw that lights were coming on all down the street because it was dusk he started to laugh pushing away the memory of a woman under a sputtering lamp in old church street only seconds before and walked on towards a row of mostly darkened shops resting his right shoulder against the windows as he passed from doorway to doorway only one shop was lit or half lit drably around a windowdisplay h w worthy monumental mason mottled grey marble gravestone with a glistening black flowerpot empty and a dark green tangly wreath no bright beckoning lights no flowers no fountains worthy had it right the dark and true nature of death bobby maiden rested his forehead against the cool of the plateglass window staring death in the face and the face of death stared back from the drab wreath the dark leaves framed it a face made of compost and fibre broken twigs clenched in its earthblackened teeth its deepset eyes darkly glowing its hair and beard writhing with voracious organic life the face of death grinned at maiden his stomach pulsed an acrid bile rose into his throat he was only vaguely aware of a grey car gliding to the kerb the passenger door swinging open before it slid to a stop you look lost bobby suzanne said we have a problem jonathan said on the phone to andy your friend has checked out of lower severn without leaving a forwarding address bobby maiden whats he doing on lower severn dr connelly had him moved couldnt see why he was still in accident and emergency now hes gone brian connelly wouldnae see his ownhes gone taken his clothes and left you mean you let him just walk oot it was before i came in sister andy he had visitors apparently his father and the superintendent nobody liked to disturb them then they had a death on the ward and tea was delayed and when they brought mr maidens he was gone and his clothes from the locker the man in the next bed says he simply got up and strolled out staggered more like you checked around the building virtually everywhere except the ventilation tunnels we assume he became disoriented wandered off sister fox has informed the police i thought youd want to know taken his clothes aw hell the boys no fit to be out thats what i thought like i havenae enough problems andy said the halfpacked suitcase lay on the bed if she didnt leave soon she wouldnt make st marys before mrs willis was asleep just let me know ok she sat in the back with him thigh to thigh just like before this is nice inspector she was luminous in the dimness of the car wearing an orangey sweatsuit her hair down a lot was different about her this is really nice in fact when we spotted you i really couldnt believe it we thought youd be in hospital for a long long time he said nothing same driver too victor clutton father of the late dean no mistaking him this time the old sierra rattling off into the twilit town centre suzanne gazing at him looking genuinely spontaneously happy a glow about her that shone through the ubiquitous grey kindling something half forgotten in the late bobby maiden dont get fooled again this the very same car isnt it bit of a risk not a dent on it bobby you went whizzing over the bonnet banged your head on the kerb jesus i really cant believe this in the papers it was touch and go touch and gone in fact inspector lazarus you might say pretty scary all round bobby especially as vic was trying so hard to avoid you as it was in fact all your own fault thats the story youve agreed is it thats the truth just like tonys your uncle well yeah that was a lie i also know a van gogh from an atkinson grimshaw and a wordsworth from a larkin i was just having fun bobby you know that hey im not kidding suzanne crooked her head to peer directly into his eyes whether you remember or not it was a genuine bloody accident we just couldnt believe you didnt get out of the way vic clutton said ask him why he was walking down the middle of the road sorter thing ask him what he thought i was supposed to fucking do you did look awfully strange bobby like youd been dropped out of a ufo i was walking towards you you were under a streetlamp you were waiting i was in the car bobby i went straight back to the car vicd been parked round the corner the whole time hadnt you you were under the bloody the faulty streetlamp coming on going off lighting the figure of the woman had he imagined her waste of bleedin breath clutton hit the accelerator to overshoot the junction with old church street like i said hell either finger us or he wont suzanne said just do the driving vic he thinks we fitted up his son isnt that right mr clutton dont be naive bobby vic knows dean was dealing freelance he was a very silly boy was dean god rest his poor corrupt little soul had to prove he was smarter than his old man didnt he vic vic said nothing drove down towards the suburbs the sun low over a horizon spiked with pylons they were never close suzanne said but we wont open that particular can of worms ok maiden leaned his head back until it was almost on the parcel shelf if it was an accident why not long before this accident happened did you advise me to go back in the flat and lock the door suzanne was silent for a long time oh yeah vic said suspicious thats what you said to him was it look theres a kids playing field back there suzanne said i fancy a bit of a swing you up to pushing me bobby the playground was deserted in the dusk maiden wedged himself into a metal roundabout suzanne sat on the lip of a rusting slide maiden felt calmer than he could remember what gets me bobby is not so much why a halfway decent artist like you became a copper as how you got so good at it putting two and two together and making seventeen i was pissed out of interest though purely out of interest was seventeen the right answer you know it bloody was vic clutton was leaning on his sierra parked fifty yards away he was having a smoke feigning unconcern look im not saying tonys a good man suzanne said hes a businessman in the free market first and foremost a businessman is what he is he can be like awkward if anybody threatens his regular income but hes never and he wouldnt lie about this not to me hes never done anything terminal terminal maiden sighed youre really into this vintage gangland vernacular arent you suzanne look inspector no bullshit it wouldve upset him quite a bit if somebodyd suggested to him that the only way of removing a particular obstacle was that he might actually do something like i mean cold you mean a wet job in cold blood dont laugh i didnt something close to anxiety in suzannes eyes the eyes were dark but no longer black she looked a little older but softer her voice had softened too the brittle edges planed off are you saying somebody did suggest something like that to tony she shrugged i wonder who that could have been i havent the faintest idea suzanne looked him frankly in the eyes but you could probably expect it to be somebody who might not find it so convenient to do it himself or compatible with his chosen profession maiden thought about this for a while in his new state of calm the doubleglazing again everything far below him an insect world superintendent martin riggs had invited tony parker to help him decommission bobby maiden so closing his eyes to trap the thoughts what i think you might be saying is that tony thought or was persuaded to think before he went along with the suggestion of this other person that he ought to have one attempt at dealing with the problem in an equally timehonoured but less drastic fashion based on tonys usual philosophy of everybody having his price i wouldnt know about any of that of course you wouldnt but someone else mightve been strongly disapproving if hed had it done i mean the other thing who me for a start suzanne stood up smacking grasscuttings from her trousers as if she was brushing off extraneous lies stuff this facing him hands behind her back if you hadnt worked it out emma curtis nee parker maiden grabbed the bars of the roundabout almost losing his balance oh he said tony parker was known to have a grownup kid elham had never seen a kid raised at the house hed given his former wife in the nice part of essex where a daughter might attend a good school learn languages have riding lessons grow up respectable bugger me maiden said of course shed have loved it doing herself up like a faintly sinister tart white makeup little black number to spill out of when she reached for her drink he grinned surely the first time since his previous life was that your idea the pictures not bad i thought bobby for a spur of the moment thing i was quite proud of it for a while but then then when it started to go badly wrong the reality of her old mans world thrown in her face like a bucketful of ice after which she might have been expected to wash off the whiteface in a hurry go running back to essex to hide under the bedclothes avoid reading the papers for a while only she hadnt a few coloured sparks started crackling across the drabness the rippling electricity of sex tell me he said what made riggs decide drastic action was called for oh she said well she lay back in the arms of the playground slide looked up at the darkening sky all right what the hell a guy called percy gilbert i dont know these people i dont spend much time up here this guys a police informer right they all know that but its tolerated because it works both ways in his case and these days he only grasses up the people they want grassed up the little turd maiden said so this gilbert knows youve been asking questions about tony but it was the messenger that did it the local rag you had a brief thing going word has it percys word anyway with a certain siobhan gallagher journalist with the messenger oh no maiden said weakly whose boss roger gibbs gibson gibbs was informed by laurie argyle the estate agent whos a member of his lodge something like that that this gallaghers been making inquiries about the unnamed names behind the feeny park development maiden moaned not getting anywhere because the riggs connections buried much deeper but it caused some anxiety not very bright bobby if you dont mind me saying so letting your pillow talk stray into areas this dangerous mr gibbs gave ms gallagher a very serious talking to and she buggered off back to belfast anyway but this is when i understand your mr riggs suggested it might be better all round knowing you as he did if pa were to have you popped before you did any damage you understand this isnt something i would normally ever learn about in a million years because as far as the little girl is concerned her daddy is a bona fide businessman a straightdowntheline plain dealer but i was up for the weekend and he was drinking like the proverbial worried ive never seen him so worried its not his thing really it isnt the reason he moved up here in the first place was he was winding down its nothing but drugs he kept saying drugs are taking over its all hard kids now im too old somebody send for a violinist maiden said she scowled sat up in the slide ill deny all this of course of course i said have you never tried you know nah he says the geezer dont do the circuit stays at home on his days off apparently painting pictures you believe that well i thought you sounded interesting i said i want to meet him then i get all this youre staying out of it princess and thats final stuff but i could always get round him you surprise me honest to god bobby emma curtis stood up i know when ive blown it i was ready to go crawling back shamefaced that night then you just walked into us like you couldnt give a toss what the fuck came over you i dont know i made vic stop i sent him to phone for an ambulance i ran back i thought you were dead i didnt know what to do vic came back hed parked down near the main road when we heard the ambulance he dragged me away im sorry i couldnt be more sorry he saw tears in her eyes he believed her she went to sit on a swing kicked at the ground to get it moving what happens now then guv they call you guv up here im only au fait with the london vernacular as you know she found a shallow smile life gets complicated dont it aint got nothing on death really never mind the other side of the playground vic clutton coughed impatiently stamping on his cigarette end sparks flying up he your regular chauffeur pa thinks i need a good strong minder you dont live with tony then im in one of his singlepersons apartments for the moment in the er feeny park development its quite nice actually for elham has it got a bed she stopped swinging her eyes widened but not very much bobby pardon me for saying this and i dont wish to sound unflattered or anything but quite frankly at this moment you dont look like you could screw the cap off a bottle of ribena i meant a spare bed actually ive got a problem just for tonight she bit down on a smile xiii vic clutton drove them back towards the town centre it was dark maiden hadnt thought about death for nearly ten minutes it was a start your poor eye she stroked his hair back put her fingers on his forehead state of the health service a few years ago they wouldnt have discharged you like this wheres mr curtis he leaned his head back on the parcel shelf closed his eyes under her hand everybodys allowed one mistake only one mr curtis was a commodities broker and you got tired of being a commodity he liked to handle a variety of commodities what a loser maiden said thank you they turned into old church street and then left into telford avenue here vic clutton said it was suzemmas idea that vic should assist maiden to gain access to his flat to pack some clothes spare chequebook whatever fine maiden didnt want to move possibly ever lets not hang about vic slid the sierra into the kerb em you keep a serious eye open any problems honk twice all right little short ones bip bip not just a police car any car especially any car maiden said especially if its a biggish rover whatever he says vic said shake yourself mr maiden lets get this sorted from the glove compartment vic took gloves soft leather motoring gloves which he put on plus a small tool kit in a canvas pouch plus a little torch when we get in we dont put lights on all right mr maiden and dont take too much out one suitcase otherwise it looks like a bleeding robbery maiden got out noticed emma doing a little smirk nothing criminal bobby its just like hiring a locksmith maiden still felt about five feet from his brain bump on the heads a funny thing vic said conversationally not whispering as they let themselves into the yard behind the flat you read about people their whole personality changes sorter thing previous to this ive never seen it at first hand you dont know what i was like before i know you were a copper this aint the way a copper does it he loses his keys wasnt my idea no full of ideas little em well vic lowered his voice seems like youre in trouble mr maiden somebody wants your balls on a saucer where you gonna go i mean after tomorrow somewhere at least fifty miles away maybe more vic shut the yard gate behind them screwed the latch back it was very dark in the yard there was one light above them on the third and top floor curtains drawn vic stood with his back to the gate look mr maiden something i want to get out the way sorter thing lowering his voice considerably the boy it was me planted the stuff on the boy dean he was dealing he was using he wouldnt listen i put the stuff in his motorbike smack a lot enough to get him off the streets i give him to beattie for riggs only regret it wasnt soon enough as it turned out im sorry maiden said how it turned out yeah well remand centres are bad places they can get you that way if youre already jittery i just didnt see no alternative at the time couldve worked for tony he didnt wanna know wouldnt listen to me big man you know as i recall maiden said three other mavericks got lifted not long after dean cowan sharpe tommy singh vic looked momentarily uncomfortable all very surprised to find they had a few ounces around the house in their cars wherever no surprise to parker though no surprise to riggs if you had any proof mr maiden we wouldnt be discussing it and not a protest from any of them especially not after what happened to dean now look dont think i never considered it dont think the issue was never raised with tony and tony said tony said it was bollocks maybe tony doesnt know wouldnt be the first time somebody on remand got an assisted passage screws dont earn a fortune youre suggesting riggs had him waxed im suggesting nothing vic all right i dont like riggs too clever cut above important friends one day hell dump tony in the shit walk away clean as a whistle like one of them bent tory mps yeah like i said i thought about it but in the end im not buying so you wouldnt consider giving evidence oh mr maiden ever the humorist clutton walked up a couple of steps to the back door right then good job youre ground floor mortice i take it three lever not very clever area like this i never cared enough what they say about you wild card loose cannon not one of the lads noone likes a copper whos not one of the lads specially if hes good at his job very dicey combination that beats me what she sees in you youre fond of her arent you like an uncle smart kid university the whole bit understands about her dad what he does dont try to change him but clean tonys seen to it shes clean what a parent she fancies you rotten thats the problem in my view a very serious problem comes over dead cool and streetsmart as you know but the night we run you down shes all over the place beating her lovely breast sorter thing what im saying mr maiden i would hate any harm to come to that girl i lost my boy lost him a couple of years before he did for hisself thats by the by but if anything happens to that girl you really are a dead man you get the subtlety of what im saying victor maiden said all i want out of emma is somewhere to sleep for one night no complications then im gone make sure you are vic bent over the lock feeling his way with his gloved hands hello well well problem saves us a job in one respect he stepped back flicked his torch briefly at the lock and then off again long enough for maiden to see splintered wood somebody mustve read about you being indisposed sorter thing i dont know what societys coming to hardly worth going in now then surprised at himself there was no feeling of anger or violation the flat had belonged to someone else someone who was dead so it didnt matter bobby maiden felt very strange an image floated into his head of a streetlamp going on and off he heard the buzzing sound it made he shivered you want to go in anyway mr maiden he didnt want to ok ill grab a few clothes no burglar would bother with my clothes after you then vic pushed back the door maiden went into his tiny kitchen where the only lights were the ones you could see through the small high window it smelled musty it smelled of cigarette smoke suzannes perhaps except she couldnt have had more than one and that was how many nights ago no somebody had been in here for some time he decided he ought to make the effort i think ill put a light on after all vic make it quick then shit maidens hand hadnt reached the switch before all the lights came on the room flooded with glare and movement he saw flat eyes in a shaven head denims the guy kicking a table out of his way as he advanced on maiden fat hands around a crowbar another one behind him that him yeah the crowbar went back knocking cups off the shelf over the drainer do it maiden raised an arm but not fast enough and the crowbar smashed into the side of his head and he fell seeing the bar going back for another one before a steel toecap took away his sight xiv norah picked up sounding relieved said it was real thoughtful of grayle to call and she would be only too happy to prise lyndon out the tub before he cut his wrists huh no hey listen ill call back grayle yelled knowing that if she put down the phone shed do no such thing that once the effect of the final halfbottle of california flat had worn off shed change her mind about this but norah had already gone and grayle waited biting her lip she found her voice also was shaking when lyndon mcaffrey arrived on the line sounding just as dry as usual and she just said it the words spurting out lyndon im going crazy i have to quit uh huh youre surprised right lyndon said uh huh see im nearly thirty years old mmmmm and all i do is write about other peoples searches for answers to what its all about i think thats called journalism grayle and ive been doing this going on four years now the new age column and at first i felt it was you know really important like in a kind of evangelical way making people aware of of more i have like tens of thousands of readers and most of them write to me and i used to reply to all of them but now when the guy comes in hauling this huge sack im like take it away take it away the whole thing is way out of control im just not not big enough all these poor perplexed people who obviously think im this major guruperson when really my lifes more screwed up than theirs in most cases and im just serving up spiritual junk food this is your sister brought all this on right well i just wonder whether this whole things like conveying a message to me that i need to get away find i dont know spiritual first base that what i need to discover is not so much ersula as me find out if theres really anything underneath the shlocky facade and and if you say if you say uh huh one more fucking time silence but you can you know say something you know lyndon said i thought at first you were going to say it was because of me that you couldnt face life on the paper without someone to share nauseous doughnuts with he chuckled mirthlessly ah how we overestimate our own status lyndon what are we talking about here im forced to conclude noone on the courier saw fit to inform you that our masters have formally requested my retirement whhaaat the godcollar fell to the carpet shouldnt have been a surprise im fiftysix years old couple days ago i was telling myself hell lyndon youre only fiftysix i guess i was looking at it from the wrong end young guys been walking over me for years like theres a white line down my back goddamn cult of youth oh this makes me so mad lyndon im so sorry lyndon found another arid chuckle the editor is thirtyeight he thinks hes already kind of old for the job what he told me today he said lyndon i give myself five more years at the sharp end so you see grayle i am a fortunate man indeed to have survived so long she was in tears the column would have lasted about two weeks but for lyndon hed pull offthewall snippets from the news mush pass them on to grayle who in the early days with only student and underground newspaper experience was frankly floundering lyndon was a great newspaperman of course after more than a quarter of a century the payoff as you would guess is considerable we could retire to florida norah and i play a little golf maybe edit the senior citizens community newsletter without you there i wouldnt want to stay anyway you dont need me any more youre established why youre almost never figured id say this almost a pro thats the kindest thing i ever heard you say to anybody but even if i really was a pro it would make no difference it wouldnt be the same paper you know lyndon said i was just lying in the tub thinking this is how a life goes leastways the years between sunup and sundown just wish id realized twenty years ago that the higher you go the thinner the air gets what i mean is yesterday i would have been trying to talk you out of this now well nearly thirty in the noveltycolumn department you could be close to peaking grayle close to peaking how importants the money the money never was important money just holds you down i have enough to get by i could always sublet the apartment you plan to go find ersula in her neolithic sanctuary i think we could talk now for the first time on something like level ground i think we need to talk because in some ways shes been the big sister you know you could take a vacation do it that way i may find ersula in a couple weeks finding myself could take a little longer holy grayle carries a lot of excess baggage youll go to england wherever beats florida climate excepted you wont go to florida lyndon you will never go to florida that a firm psychic prediction grayle the wine all gone the decision made a decision made if truth be told some while back shed give in her notice tomorrow maybe shed tell them it was a protest thing about lyndon mcaffrey and the cult of youth holy grayle was through with cults shed have to tell the parents mom who read the column avidly would be sorry to see it go but shed understand all the stuff about finding yourself having found a whole new and arguably monstrous self at the age of fiftyeight dad who hated the column and all it stood for but believed in the need for a firm career structure would come on like she was one of his more valued students planning to drop out before next semester if things became difficult she would have to show him ersulas letter the whole bit he ought then to understand why she needed to be pulled out of this before she went as crazy as grayle grayles eyes began to prickle it was as if ersula was reaching out to her as if thousands of miles apart they were seeking a common bond automatically she closed her eyes pictured ersula with her blond hair and her steady watchful almost cold blue eyes slowing her breathing reaching out for ersula nothing it never did work did it especially when your senses were swimming in stale wine xv ok mr lazarus where is he my flat goodlooking girl with very dark hair dressed for aerobics she kept biting her thumb looked scared half to death but doing her best not to show it shed been waiting for andy in the lobby where there was a uniformed doorman who must be the only one in elham a digital wall clock showed she ought to be miles from here by now she ought to be there so no time for formalities the doorman lifted andys beatenup holdall after them into the lift jesus god but this place had changed not so long ago the edwardian building overlooking the park used to be full of oldestablished solicitors and insurance brokers offices and dentists surgeries brass plates and steps up then some consortium headed by tony parker the leisure operator had somehow acquired the building and now it was very expensive luxury apartments not flats and it was all cream walls and concealed lighting she didnt recognize the woman one of elhams fortunates then never crashed the car attempted suicide got mugged burned battered by the husband half an hour ago shed phoned the hospital sounding panicky demanding to talk to sister anderson the night sister sharon fox had refused as was customary to give out andys home number but the woman had left her own and her name suzanne and a message its about mr lazarus andy had called her back in seconds it was one of those lifts you couldnt even tell when it was moving the girl leaned against the doors breathed out thank christ i owe you one mrs anderson im useless in these situations youre suzanne emma em forget suzanne bobby said you could be trusted but not the hospital aye maybe so the lift doors opened directly across was a fancy darkwood apartment door with a brass on it the girl banged the panels with her fists me vic no problem recognizing the grizzled guy who let them in not one of elhams fortunates andy having glued him together more than twice in the bloodied hour after closing time could be a messy one sister vic clutton said and andys heart sank because if even he thought it was messy then it was very messy big picture window in the bedroom the lights of elham but it might have been paris distance the night and the trees hiding all the scars and cavities and bruised smashed people the wee lights making it look pretty and contented peas andy demanded em said sorry frozen peas soft packet beans sweetcorn anything like that ill get it vic said aye hed been down this alleyway before ill check the freezer theyd put bobby maiden on the bed blood was soaking into the cream duvet where it had poured down from the eye to join another river from a long cut under the jaw as for the eye itself jesus god how could this happen again tonight of all nights put the big light on ok son look up and open it i need it open it would have to be the left eye again he tried his best to open it but she had to do it for him which was like getting into a walnut if this turned out the way she feared it was going to be no messing and prayers holding his head it felt familiar in an awfully disturbing way but no time for that now keep still good boy the woman em standing with her back to the picture window biting her thumbnail andy peered into bobby maidens left eye jesus god what em sprang up what it moved shit andy sagged the damn pupil contracted in the light whats that mean calm down hen its a good sign if the pupil wouldnae move wed have big trouble this is the eye that took it last time i was convinced the pupil wasnae gonny contract but it did so we breathe again you got pain anywhere else son no dont shake your head you daft sod jesus god can i get you some tea mrs anderson no time hen aye ok vic clutton came back with the frozen peas and she arranged the bag over the eye instructing bobby not to move any numbness nothing i didnt have before he said thickly im sorry im really sorry about this save it how about the other eye can you see out of that ok bobby fumbled a deathly smile whatve you done to your hair good she rummaged in her holdall dug out a packet of lightweight gauze you got any sellotape hen drawer over the bookcase vic would you mind ill make some tea can you i mean is he going to be all right a hospital would tell you better than me and a hospitals what he needs i kid you not forget it bobby said really shut up you andy turned to em all right forget the tea no bullshit howd this happen we took him back to his flat to get some things em said vic these two blokes was already in the flat sister in the dark dead quiet suddenly all the lights go on no warning and they come for him with these iron bars crowbars jesus god burglars what i thought at first vic looked at em tell her she said biting a thumbnail tell her the lot i dont care who goes down for this vic shuffled well it was it wasnt burglars you surprise a burglar he might go for you in a panic sorter thing not these two it was what theyd come for they was waiting for him give him a beating with iron bars a big beating vic said say it the girl said a final beating yeah vic said looked like it was gonna be a final beating sorter thing you mean seenitall andy knowing shed gone white they were waiting to kill him wouldve looked like hed interrupted a burglary when they found him god above whats he into vic looked across at the bed then at em em said bobby sure he said you can say what you want in front of andy we go back vic rubbed his jaw what a bleeding mess he sat on a corner of the bed course they never thought thered be two of us and i had me little tool kit andy said against iron bars i threw the tools at the window sister well its a quiet street in spite of the bypass em hears the glass go thinks it couldnt be me and starts on the car hooter course theyve no way of telling these lads how many of us was out there couldve been we was mobhanded for all they know they piss off smartish the front way selfpreservation cooling their aggression sorter thing you told the police em and vic looked at one another thats a problem is it andy starting to wonder who these people were how they connected with inspector maiden like were he and the girl an item its one hell bobby tried to sit up moaned fell back on the bed of a problem i told you to stay still andy snapped dont you dislodge those peas we do have a problem with the police he said though not all the police there are policemen and policemen in this town em said like everywhere i suppose after theyd gone we didnt hang around vic said were practically dragging him back to the car hes half out of it as you can imagine i know we shouldntve moved him sister but if them guys came back which was a possibility be quite an earner for them you know listen i dont want to know the less i know the better what i do know is you ought to be in hospital bobby you ought never tove come out this is some kind of madness he didnt reply he was looking deathly look ill make him an eyepatch with sellotape but he needs a proper one long john silver job no pressures the thing to remember ice packs till then she stood back could look worse than it is but we cannae be sure therell be bad bruises where they hit him with the bar could still be internal injuries he needs constant attention any change for the worse any change at all that isnae for the better you get on to a bloody doctor pronto yhear can he bide here a while no way maiden said not now you be quiet son andy said you make too many of your own decisions did i no tell you to think first i think he might be right mrs anderson it sounds ridiculous to say he wouldnt be safe here but thats what youre saying is it hen maybe we knew things were difficult we didnt realize how difficult those lads vic said not local they was of an age id know them if they was local well you think about it you dont just hire complete strangers half an hours notice to go and beat somebody to death they was on a retainer they was just waiting for the word if this is pa ill bloody kill him id say not id say somebody lost patience with your old man its getting less difficult to find people wholl do for somebody for a couple of grand plus theres a lot of very discreet middlemen about so it dont get traced back andy said as calmly as she could manage theyre gonny try again are they not vic shrugged there was an answer to this situation andy closed her eyes momentarily and saw a pale red sun against the lids oh aye a very obvious answer here so obvious she wanted to resist it i hear your daddy was at the hospital bobby is there no chance dont even ask like that eh you got a problem then son andy walked over to the window saw her own grimfaced reflection hologrammed over the lights of elham she shouldve been in st marys by now so what did you have in mind to do about this bobby get out of town book into a hotel somewhere for a few days except my wallets in the hospital safe cash credit cards looking like this is going to be another problem you book into a hotel with a face like this they do a courtesy check with the local police im a bit buggered really we can sort out the money jonathanll get that bobby listen theres a place you could go well out of it where nobodys gonny find you where you could have the time to heal son you need to heal physically mentally and it was as if when shed placed her hands on his head bringing up high knoll shed made a connection plugged into a live circuit and it wasnt going to be broken the current was strengthening it was the right thing to do and spiritually andy looked at him blood all over his elham hospital fun run tshirt there are some places you heal quick some places heal parts of you you didnae know were sick im sure there are he said but its not your problem andy were really grateful for what youve done dont get involved any further not many laughs in this hey andy walked to the foot of the bed dont you tell me whats no my problem bobby maiden theyre gonny kill you son you hang around here and then youll die and go back to the nasty grey place am i right she regretted it at once his whole body went rigid im sorry son she said she rang jonathan and told him as much of everything as she could pack into four minutes what a colourful life you lead sister andy jonathan said how long will you need well i already begged two days ill try and stick to it but if it takes longer it takes longer dont put your pension on the line jonathan warned for a bit of mumbo jumbo she made the eyepatch she told bobby maiden to get some sleep he said no way he lay there staring at the ceiling he seemed to be glad of the pain she thought she understood emma curtis took her into another room where are you taking him im no sure you need to know that hen nobodys going to bloody torture me sister and if he cant visit me i want to visit him you sure youre good for each other hen the dark eyes didnt move whats that got to do with the price of eggs ok andy smiled let me have your phone number again ill call you when he can see what hes doing thanks emma said and thanks at two am an ambulance arrived apologies sister the paramedic said earliest i could make it giving andy the envelope containing bobby maidens wallet and his keys dr jonathan says good luck with the er mumbo jumbo xvi threefifteen am andy driving as if she could read bobby maidens mind grimfaced under the fluffedup red hair clogging the pedal as though they were breaking bail all mobiles alert for a tenyearold powderblue golf with a greenpeace sticker slowing only whenever she spotted a police car but it wasnt police as such that maiden was worried about he was seeing a dark vehicle blocking a country road two men in balaclavas tooled up silencers no small talk no prelims maiden then andy the golf driven into a wood with the bodies but then maiden was as paranoid as you can get they were a good ten miles out of elham before andy spoke whos emma then mmm well he told her about the hitandrun car which had first brought him to her attention aw youre no serious plus in case you missed the references back there her old mans tony parker andy shook her head laughing her comfortable smokers laugh jesus god bobby and i thought i was mixing with lowlife the day they called me into a meeting of the hospital trust shes ok didnt you think andy thought about it aye genes arent everything and the last person shell ever harm is you but youll know that are you no awfully knackered bobby long past knackered knackered was yesterday shed tilted the passenger seat for him but hed pulled it back up even further so it was almost a right angle he concentrated hard on the lights through the windscreen but with half his vision blocked by the makeshift patch it was hard to keep his good eye open but youre no gonny let yourself sleep right no bobby you need sleep sleep and sleep youre no gonny die bobby not again i mean like not yet not imminently they were at a brightly lit motorway intersection big blue signs when they hit the motorway itself it felt safer a no mans land i was wondering got anything in your bag to kind of ward off sleep speed in your condition christ you would be bloody dead theres chocolate biscuits in the glove compartment and thats your lot should have asked clutton i dont like the way youre talking andy leaned back in her seat hands loosening around the wheel look im no shrink but maybe what were looking at here is your subconscious manufacturing a smokescreen setting up a block to shield you from some trauma images of bleakness this cold soulless place cold neutralizes pain like when we put the frozen peas on your eye yes but well ok suppose you wake up dead is that no a wee bit contradictory with all your bodily juices drying up your muscles dead weight veins clogged oh and being aware of decaying tasting the soil shit andy said twice thats happened how normal is that aw hell she hesitated you know what this says to me i mean this is just off the top of my head i havenae thought it out but its as if when after we brought you round some part of you stayed dead its as though something down there in your mind doesnae know we got your body to come back he saw her hands tighten on the wheel its like youre carrying around your own corpse bobby well thanks maiden said thats very encouraging they kept on talking after that there was a flask of black coffee em had made and chocolate biscuits they were through spaghetti junction so little traffic this time in the morning that the great concrete snakepit looked like a major overspend she was telling him about this guy called marcus bacton a schoolteacher for over thirty years though he claimed to hate kids worse than the flu took early retirement after his wifes death and bought himself this rundown farmhouse on the welsh border to start a new career as a magazine editor kind of learned gentlemans journal of the unexplained printed on the kind of paper you wouldnae wipe your arse on in case your fingers went through so hes stuck out in the sticks losing money hand over fist on this awful rag and having to pay a housekeeper on account of he cannae tie his own shoes lucky to land one who didnae ask for much other than a roof over her mrs willis the healer andy pulled off the motorway giving two fingers to the driver of an escort whod zipped in from the fast lane and cut in front dickhead listen i never went for this baloney laying on of hands sending healing vibes im a professional like if it works what we doin spending billions on hospitals and clinics and yet healing vibes he was remembering jonathan telling him about andys hands either side of his head as he lay dead andys eyes closed it was as if she was somewhere else she was concentrating so hard on bringing you back it was as though nothing else in the world mattered or ever would again if she failed when you started to breathe she just sagged and we thought maiden jerked in his seat hed almost slipped away it was like waking up on the edge of a sheer cliff he swallowed a lot of air and laid his cheek against the window for the coolness of it burial chamber andy was saying part of it had collapsed and there was a sign telling you not to go inside but me all six and a half stone of me i fitted under the capstone no trouble i was that weak you know when you said that about being dried out like a corpse that was how it was for me with the colitis youre just crapping all the moisture out of your system youre a husk tired the whole time and weary as hell and youll try anything and so im lying there in this burial chamber until the dawn comes you like the dawn bobby when the worlds all quiet and fresh and sparkly this was a dawn like i never knew and ive seen a few thousand end of a shift its like very dark in this wee chamber i mustve fallen asleep straight away just lying there on the hard earth these huge stones all around me a really dense sleep and then the next thing i become aware of my hand i mustve been lying with my arms under my head and my hands are out in front and this hand its like its on fire the car slowed her hands on the wheel lit by red light from traffic signals but its its like the fires inside the hand glowing in the darkness just this hand not the stone not the earth just the hand like theres fire inside so i reach out with the other hand to touch it and that lights up too the lights changed to green and andy pulled away maiden saw she was smiling what it was it was the midsummer sun coming in through the slit in this really focused beam they were warm too the hands they were coming into worcester city centre and by its lights maiden could see the girl in andys rugged face found i was breathing very very slowly aware of each breath as it came in and it was like each breath was going further into my body and while this happened it was getting progressively lighter and warmer inside the chamber the sunlight coming between these big stones like molten gold from a whatyoucallit crucible i can feel it now maiden smiled at hardbitten andy all poetic but he was impressed afterwards walking back to the cottage it was like you know walking on the golden clouds it was midsummers day they told me how this wee girl years back she had this vision of the virgin mary in this very same place on midsummers morning jesus its enough tae give you religion he noticed how her accent would ebb the result of thirty years in england and then roll back in a wave with the powerful memories they wouldnae take any more money for the cottage though mrs w fed me for days fresh fruit homemade veggie soup and weird stuff from bottles with stoppers miracles magic when i left i was about a stone heavier but light inside you know and before i go she says you can do this now if you want to so when i get back to work im signing on for every healing course advertised on the back wall of elham healthfoods acupuncture homoeopathy cranial osteopathy reiki maiden said cautiously youre saying you used this on me andy shook her head i wouldnae claim credit im a convert to alternative medicine but powerful enough to kickstart the dead i dont dare think the holy mother bobby i was raised a presbyterian all im saying theres something remarkable about that place and i cannae explain it in any scientific terms whether its some kind of magnetic thing some property of the place like lourdes and such i wouldnae have any idea about that all i know is when you were lying stone dead on that table in a and e i was holding the image in ma head of the rising sun at high knoll and willing it to come into ma hands and to come into you we thought for a second that she was going to drop dead jonathan had said maybe i blacked out for a split second and the next thing the whole teams jumpin up and down and whooping and everybodys hugging me and stuff i couldnae i couldnae go home i was too high couldnae sleep that night they were through the city now back in the dark country so why didnt you feel like that bobby breaks ma heart the other side of hereford small signs were saying michaelchurch craswall longtown tiny scattered lights from windows in the sky hill country i feel ive been ungrateful maiden said you wasted your light get lost theres always a reason for things did i ask you what you believed bobby if you ever believed there was stuff out there yeah well through the windscreen maiden saw a church steeple greyly smokeringed with low night cloud i used to believe all kinds of stuff once when you were gonny be a painter yeah not many coppers believe like doctors like how can any kind of a just god allow this shit im a cynic bobby and a sceptic i take a lot of convincing years of seeing good human beings die prematurely and bad human beings keep on recovering i have no answers and yet truth is id love to believe all that maiden said be nice to be that kind of person new age cop but my experience of being dead ties in only too well with the kind of deaths ive been seeing for years cold ugly to be avoided he sighed to be avoided at the end of the village street a muddied sign said capelyffin mountain road unsuitable for heavy vehicles nearly there son andy said she was thinking of how when she talked to marcus yesterday he said mrs willis told him she had seen a black light over the knoll that would make sense to bobby all right with his experience black light in the headlights the whitened bonebranches of two halfdead trees locked horns over the road xvii never needed an alarm he awoke at six precisely to the bloody second always woke at six from the days when he was employed to forcefeed shakespeare sonnets to gluesniffing thugs so when marcus fumbled on his glasses and the luminous clock said he knew there was a problem had hardly any sleep didnt get to bed until half past one sitting around waiting for the anderson woman seriously who could you rely on these days and worrying about mrs willis whod gone to bed early after two hours sitting alone in her healing room and not here was the clincher not even coming out for the archers another crash thunderous but familiar an october gust thrusting at the barn door slamming it back and forth what happened to the new padlock and chain one day that door would blow off and thered have to be a gaping hole for the duration because he couldnt afford to replace it whole bloody fabric was coming apart rot setting in and the farmhouse would collapse a bloody sight faster than the original castle felt he was under siege in his own ruins the motte a tiny island in a falconer sea foundations eroding the whole of the western world turning into a falconer society glib superficial arrogant narcissistic bastards the barn door went again this time with a faint splintering coda as though it had been hit by a team of men with a battering ram and they were backing off for another go it must have sprung completely open in the dark marcus pulled his trousers from the bedpost never be caught without your trousers and his tweed jacket from the bedroom door hauling it on over his string vest creeping in his socks down the stone stairs although there was little danger of awakening mrs willis state of her hearing these days and stepping into his wellies by the back door malcolm ambling through to join him the cold hit him with a surprisingly vicious punch be winter before you knew it seemed no bloody time at all since last winter the way the years just flashed by but then why shouldnt they a year was nothing sixty years were nothing what could you learn in sixty bloody years what had marcus bacton learned bugger all of any real significance just has to be more than this he told the dog grabbing his torch from the hook in the porch stumbling into the yard the barn door blew out at him as he reached it almost knocking him over bastard looked like the bloody chain had snapped but when he pointed his torch at it he saw the chain hanging loose from the hasp the padlock still dangling from the chain and the bloody padlock was open what the hell couldnt be a burglar or a tramp looking for a bed unless it was a tramp with the skill and patience to pick locks and the door was so rotten anyway that he could have kicked his way in quicker and good god marcus saw that the key was still in the padlock the keys to the buildings were all kept in an old coffee tin on the kitchen window ledge oh my god mrs willis andy swung the car sharply right into a bumpy track between outstretched arms of stone whats that its a castle bobby did i no tell you he lived in a castle something huge and tubular was pushing out of a bushy mound into the charcoalgrey predawn half of a stone tower well he lives in it inasmuch as the walls are all round the house andy said more a liability than anything with the upkeep and the official inspections behind the ruins the headlights had found a low house heavy with oak timbers small irregular black windows andy parked about fifty yards away well bide here a while dont want to set the dog off marcusll be about soon enough get some air i think maiden pulled down his eyepatch levered himself out of the car it was chilly the darkness rattling and squeaking his body aching there were no visible lights apart from a fading moon and a single star andy joined him how you feeling ok i bet no really better youll sleep fine here airs like rough cider listen i have a thought this may be stupid go on itll take us no more than twenty minutes to walk to the knoll you dont think thats stupid at all maiden said youve been planning it all along only a barn owl shrieked in reply he found himself losing touch with the reality of it the scene receding into a small screen of pebbleglass the kind you saw in front of vintage tv sets from the s he saw a sliver of gold in the east in the west behind the castles bushbristled mound dark hills halfway up the rise he turned to look back into the east saw the dawn like an estuary in the sky flat banks of cool sand and spreading turquoise pools but he knew there was something wrong it was just a pretty picture he wasnt feeling it you ok bobby andy moving briskly through the dewdamp field looking back at him he was out of breath she wasnt im ok he could feel the excitement in her couldnt believe that she believed his survival was down to some kind of prehistoric magic andy shook her head over the view will you look at that she had on a blue nylon jacket pink jeans and a pair of walking boots she kept in the car she looked loosened up very much at home here i mean isnt that just amazing its very nice very nice she stared at him jesus bobby i thought you were supposed to be an artist youre talking like a guy with no poetry in him sorry you think im mad dont you i mean come on if you think im out of it you bloody well say so i think youre an optimist he said lets just try it huh you stand on the knoll and you let the sun rise over you and if you think its still february just try it huh ahead of them in the west the land rose steeply towards what were either high hills or low mountains hard to separate them from the stillnight sky andy tugged at the sprung bar on a metal gate not far just well need to go careful dont wanny get arrested for trespass guy who owns the land this tv archaeologist falconer he owns this land he does now he and marcus are ah andy dragged the gate across the tufted grass not overfriendly hes apparently fenced off the knoll if he found marcus climbing over the wire hed be pressing charges wed probably get off wi a warning but hes no gonny see us anyway this early she lowered her voice with any luck andy closed the gate behind them and crackled confidently through a patch of dry bracken did she really imagine she was going to have him skipping back down the hillside praising god the virgin mary the mother goddess what happened to the girl who had the vision aw it becomes less inspiring child tells her mother gets the strap for being late to school and lying when she keeps on about it ma summons the vicar no friend of the roman church plus the local people are saying any vision at a pagan site has got to be the work of the evil one they kind of ostracized her christians maiden said cause celebre for the phenomenologist and marcus hates religious prejudice though god knows he has enough of his own look she stopped took his arm about a hundred yards away at the summit of the slope something squatted like a massive stone toad most people find them kind of weird these old sites wouldnae want to go up alone now its like approaching a cathedral she turned her face into the dawn there were channels of crimson under the lightening sandscape in the sky chips of glittering cloud andys skin was ambered in the morning glow her eyes shining red hair alight supposed to be a chambered tomb thats what the books say but this this is no to do with death jesus how can you ever turn your face into the sunrise and contemplate dying maiden looked down at the dirty yellow grass he felt cold these people andy said the old guys they positioned it to grab the earliest daylight so its all about rebirth new life healing the body healing the mind healing the spirit its everything weve forgotten as a race yknow like hey you ok nothing his mouth dry someone walking over my grave he looked down at his hands saw they were trembling never before in his whole life could he remember his hands trembling youve gone pale bobby the stone toad crouched over him ok listen to me andy put her hands on his shoulders cmon now what are you feeling right this second i dont know yes you do give me a word all right dread dread son this place saved your life you saved my life aw andy dropped her arms walked away from him shaking her head sorry wrong thing to say huh bobby everything you says wrong walked on your grave you said grave this is no to do with graves youre taking it personally damn right i am all the way down here im thinking this was gonny bring you out of it out of all this grey stuff this fear of death all this february shite it doesnt change what you did you wanted to think it was linked to your own recovery and whatever happened to you up here i dont know why you dont just accept that it was you your instincts your experience he risked another look up at the stone toad on the mound vaguely hoping it might have acquired a halo turned to gold he shuddered he could almost smell it like the worst smell hed ever known when he was with the met called out to this house in islington this welltodo suicide couple sitting naked on the sofa holding hands dead for three weeks their heads fallen together pills and whisky and hundreds of flies and on the coffee table a photo album full of pictures of naked children he turned his back on high knoll the colours of the eastern sky were flat as a fresco the dawn didnt want him all seemed so meant bobby maiden hated himself for her the place was sacred why couldnt he feel it but she wasnt even looking at him any more jesus god a short plump man was shambling and flapping towards them down the knoll anderson the man slipped and stumbled to his knees is it you he was greyhaired late middleage blinking up through heavy spectacles and a film of sweat it really is you andy reached for his hand and he stood up shakily he was wearing baggy trousers and bizarrely a string vest he clasped her hand to his chest as if to make sure she was flesh and blood im sorry marcus unforeseen circumstances everything ok no pulling from his trouser pocket a chequered handkerchief the size of a small pillowcase no its fucking not whats happened marcus im sorry it snatching off his glasses wiping his eyes andy oh god i think shes dying on me they heard the noise before they saw her it was suddenly sickeningly familiar to andy like very loud snoring she ran ahead about six feet back from the monument there was a low wooden stockadetype fence several rows of barbed wire strung over the top but the wire was cut and hanging like briars they climbed over the fence you brought her up here marcus course not she bloody well brought herself up oh god can you do something ok just you know keep calm woke up early knew something was wrong shed come down in the night let herself into the barn and pinched these look holding up a pair of rubberhandled wirecutters she cut the fence can you believe it close up the burial chamber looked like a huge collapsed crab the shell split as if someone had stood on it the old woman was laid out along the damaged capstone like like a sacrifice andy smothered the image mrs willis wore a bright green coat and a yellow woollen scarf her hair in a tight white bun the volume of her breathing sounding perversely healthy its a stroke andy said no question im sorry what i feared fuck marcus sighed blood pressure why wouldnt she see someone someone else the old womans head was pillowed by marcuss folded tweed jacket eyes were closed mouth open tongue protruding spittle and mucus all round her lips and her chin do we get her down thats the question marcus maybe not she up here when you found her just as she is now ok andy removed mrs williss glasses handed them to marcus we need to get her in the recovery position dont want her choking swallowing her tongue bobby can you take this is bobby maiden marcus patient of mine easy now on her side she stepped back bars of bright crimson had appeared in the eastern sky like the elements in an electric fire marcus said look anderson cant you you know do anything limited amount you can do for a stroke we need to keep her still then we need an ambulance how the hells an ambulance going to get up here thats their problem you just go back to the house and call them ill stay here when i said do anything marcus stood up look you know what i meant the sun had come out full and round and red aye i know andy went to sit behind the old woman in the shelter of the stones wiped her mouth with a tissue took the white head gently between her hands come on annie you can hold on the sun was turning to gold andy lifted her face to it closing her eyes waiting for the warmth to enter through the centre of her forehead travel down through the chakras until her hands were burning marcus said what did you call her oh marcus andy said softly old fool that yare you telling me it never occurred to you the natural feeling she had for this place her names joan marcus said stupidly yes yes it did occur to me the way she just arrived out of the blue but annie would be at least ninety mrs willis cant be that old can she if shed told you she was pushing ninety when she first came would you have even considered taking her on if shed said she was annie davies id have given her the earth you wouldnae have been able to keep it to yourself not for a day and youdve been on at her about it nonstop questions questions questions she didnae want the earth oh my god marcus sat in his string vest the sweat drying on his arms staring down at mrs willis then up at the sun his glasses misted she came here to die she came to heal no i mean here she came up here to die at the knoll in the dawn aw marcus andy flexed her fingers in mrs williss hair how do we know what was going through her head andys hands still werent warm she saw that bobby maiden had stepped between her and the sun his face was deeply shadowed but she could see the sellotape was peeling away from his skin and he was holding the eyepatch in place he said how about we get her down from there bobby get her off the stone why i dont know why he doesnt understand marcus said she loves this place bobby turned away from them and the stones he was trembling he walked away down the side of the knoll andy said go phone for an ambulance marcus please yes of course yes sorry marcus scrambled to his feet behind him the sun was full and round and red like a bubble of blood he looked down at mrs willis oh god marcus go he didnt look back when he reached the bottom of the mound andy called out surprised at the tremor in her voice bobby come here talk to me he came over reluctantly not looking at the stone left hand clamped over his eyepatch im sorry i dont know why i said that what do i know never mind what you know andy said this is no the damn crown court what do you feel cold sick gauze from the eyepatch was hanging down his cheek frightened give me a hand with her take her legs they lifted her bobby maiden wouldnt touch the stone they laid her on the grass marcuss jacket still under her head the sun was on the old womans face her eyes were open annie can you hear what im saying the eyes glared up at her blink blink if you can hear me mrs williss eyelids moved a fraction her skin was translucent like tissue annie andy said softly you feel better now off the stone you feel better where you are the blink was a long time coming but when it came it was more pronounced as if shed been concentrating her energy andy looked up at bobby maiden then across at the sun her hands were feeling cold the sun was a lantern of hope the land aglow in the valley the spire of st marys church was tipped with gold the birds were singing and her hands felt cold part two the world of prehistoric man was a complete one wondrous and awful and to survive in it he needed the protection that shamans could give aubrey burl rites of the gods one of the least understood aspects of shamanic work is soulretrieval in which the shaman journeys to retrieve the soul of a sick person who may be near to death it relates to the phenomenon of soul loss experienced by so many people today john matthews the celtic shaman a handbook xviii inside the body of the old one the green man awakes his muscles are stiffened and numbed after his long foetal sleep a rich resinous ancient life soaks his senses it is a while before he understands where he is above him all around him dawn birds sing birds rattling in the branches their twittering lives come and gone in a heartbeat the green man feels the silence of the old one who watched them build the church who stood here while the bones of the barbersurgeon were crushed beneath an avebury megalith who thrived before rufus died on walter tirels bolt in the new forest and still lives awaiting perhaps his third millennium because of its size the oak is more honoured but the yew has more mystery it is often referred to as the death tree because of its ubiquity in and around graveyards few realize that the yews were here long before the graves that the churches were only built on these sites because they were already sacred with the yew tree a symbol of that sanctity our oldest symbol of immortality the sign in this churchyard says although yew trees are difficult to date this venerable specimen is believed to be well over a thousand years old the wooden bench inside the hollow trunk will seat up to ten adults side by side or one man sleeping it has been an experiment how will a night in an ancient sacred tree differ from one atop a burial chamber or inside a circle of ritual stones the living yew might be expected to record stories impressions and dreams in a different way from stone and so it transpires when he rises from the bench the green mans dream is still alive and vibrating in colours in his head he sees clearly what he must do as if in a film as if it has already taken place not in or around the yew but inside the church while many centuries younger than the yew the church is medieval it stands a hundred yards outside this worcestershire village screened from the nearest houses on an ugly council estate by a dense copse he tried the two doors last night and found both locked someone at some time will have to let him in noone has passed through in the night noone disturbed the green man where he lay his back arched into the yew he steps outside the tree now stretches goes to release his morning water among the bushes and scarcely has he sheathed his tool than he hears the click of the wicket gate in the churchyard wall it is not yet seven am never has a sacrifice been delivered so promptly the green man slides to his knees in the bushes the visitor walks along the gravelled path and into his place in the green mans living dream he is elderly perhaps in his seventies and slight of build with a bald bony head and spectacles he does not appear to be a clergyman perhaps a verger or sexton a ring of keys rattles loosely from his right hand big keys church keys his keys to the afterlife the old man whistles as he enters the porch the green man hears him fitting a key into the lock jiggling it about he rises from the bushes he strides towards the porch unarmed no knife no crossbow no gun no sharpedged rock just inside the porch is a stone baptismal font the churchs oldest artefact at the end of his living dream the bowl of the font is glistening with blood and bone and brains the verger whistles a tune from some old musical as the church door swings open xix cindy marslewis made it three possibly four dead plus one nearmiss the nearmiss was the boy motorcyclist in midwales the possible was a sixteenyearold schoolgirl found strangled but not sexually assaulted last january in a bus shelter not far from harolds stones at trellech in monmouthshire this was still only a possible because the bus shelter as cindy had confirmed on a site visit was on a very dubious alignment but then cindy watched a boat far out in st brides bay there was no evidence this murderer was a perfectionist take the killing of the midlands businessman on a birdwatching weekend in wiltshire the man had been savagely and inexplicably battered to death at the foot of a small hill in the middle of field a couple of miles from avebury he could almost sense them now but it would be necessary to visit the actual murder site to be certain and he was rather unwilling to do this so soon after the event with police all over the place cindy had discovered he was not terribly popular with the police in particular that mildmannered family man dci hatch in bournemouth cindy had telephoned mrs carlotta capaldi from liverpool where he was playing third witch in a rather downmarket touring production of the scottish play to discover that hatch would appreciate a word with him ive had an inquiry about you mr lewis from the west mercia regional crime squad suspecting something of the kind cindy had waited until he was home before telephoning bournemouth cid on his mobile what the holy hell are you playing at hatch demanded you just wont take piss off for an answer will you you know theres absolutely nothing to connect these killings nothing admissible anyway and as for ringing bloody crimewatch a mistake cindy would agree but the tv programme had run such a detailed reconstruction of the killing of the poor homeless boy in a shop doorway showing precisely the location of the shop close to the ancient market cross and an impulse im afraid chief inspector they did appeal for anyone with information you didnt have information you wasted police time with a crackpot semimystical theory which even i cant entirely grasp about socalled ley lines which i understand the experts say do not even exist linking a bunch of crimes which simply have nothing in common with all respect peter said cindy thats what they said about the yorkshire ripper not my area hatch snapped oh no you dont want to talk about that do you why sutcliffe kept walking in and out of the police net because he didnt fit the profile and because they were conned by a hoax tape into looking for the wrong type of man entirely i dont see where this still several unsolved murders out there that might be down to him and why were they rejected by the ripper squad because they werent prostitutes and the profile said the yorkshire ripper only kills prostitutes mr lewis we are not looking for a serial killer psychos make their own patterns see sometimes the police are just so simplistic that hatch said icily is because at the end of the day we have to make it stand up in court now look mr lewis i was very patient i accepted your desire to do all you could for mrs capaldi and i answered your curious questions on three separate occasions but public relations has its limits and telling west mercia you were a friend of mine has quite frankly done my career no good at all is the file on maria still open there was a pause you know it is hatch said bitterly there you are then lovely your ideas were no better than mine well get him mr lewis i promise you meanwhile if i could give you a word of advice some senior policemen get rather suspicious of people who hang around murder investigations it isnt healthy if you know what i mean no said cindy nettled i do not think about it i know youre harmless relatively speaking and that your only crime is an attempt to generate some selfpublicity to revive a flagging career but less tolerant officers how dare you sorry said hatch that was probably uncalled for but you would do well to remember that while we welcome all the information we can get from the public we do tend to prefer it if you leave the interpretation to us because weve been there before but had they had they been here before would hatch have been able to say that when for instance his hampshire colleagues had discovered not so very long ago that a particularly brutal stabbing was down to a twelveyearold girl who received sexual gratification from killing the youngest potential serial murderer in history dealt with at winchester crown court in march the change of millennium was continually pushing back the parameters of human experience the british police had simply never encountered a killer who walked the ancient tracks in the footsteps of his prehistoric ancestors and committed ritual murders he would perhaps regard them as sacrifices which were identifiable as such only by the nature of their locations no connection at all except to someone educated in the arcane mysteries of the landcape there are more crimes in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy my friend cindy watched the clouds formationdancing over the bay bananas you are cindy the eyes of kelvyn kite bulged from the shadows in his corner beside the sink why do you bother you old fool the bird had a point why did he bother hatchs barb about selfpublicity had stung only briefly the stage was his career but not his life and he didnt need the money his lifestyle was humble he followed the work around britain and returned periodically to this very pretty fairground caravan on a tiny plot which he owned in a sheltered spot on the most beautiful part of the pembrokeshire coast his earthly life was neatly boxed the corners of the box pleasantly scuffed and rounded as for his inner life well sometimes it seemed to be getting richer more complex one day he would have to retire and embark upon the final stage of the great quest in preparation for his transition but that was probably years ahead he couldnt help feeling there should be an interim stage the idea that one should live ones spiritual life solely in preparation for what was to follow did seem unnecessarily selfindulgent there ought to be a way of using the incidental abilities one inevitably acquired along the way for the greater good of the community at large to fight earthly evils perhaps cindy gathered all the press cuttings into a pile on top was the one from the shropshire star hed picked up last week during the two nights the transit theatre companys macbeth had been playing the ludlow assembly rooms it was the kind of news story which for hatch would be a complete joke but to cindy was confirmation murder shop haunted claim the story was written in a way that indicated nobody on the paper believed it either it referred to the butchering of the homeless boy in the shop doorway the case which had brought cindy to the notice of the west mercia cid now a local youth leader was claiming attendance at his club was falling off because youngsters didnt like to go past this particular shop at nighttwo of the girls told me they had felt a sudden drop in the temperature as they passed the doorway and one is convinced she saw a trail of blood dripping from the step to the gutterthese are decent girls not in my view the kind to be prone to fantasies said mr ruscoe who is calling for the area to be exorcisedhowever the owner of thehardware shop chamber of trade chairman mr james mills has condemned the scare this was a terrible incident which most people in this town just want to try to forget he saidfairy stories like this are not good for trade or local morale and ted ruscoe should have more sense than to encourage them fairy stories said cindy scornfully fairy stories the man would of course have to be the chairman of the chamber of trade cindy was continually amazed at the arrogance of smalltime local officials who considered their particular field of commercial endeavour to be of supreme importance in the great scheme of things the police in most cases were exactly the same if you couldnt explain it to the crown prosecution service they wouldnt even consider it cindy swept the pile of press cuttings into a box file and went back to work on the magazines wherever he went he sought out the local dealers in publications devoted to paganism and earthmagic some of them like fortean times kindred spirit and chalice highquality glossies some like the ley hunter quite specialized and others little more than photocopied pages stapled together at least one of these surely was read and possibly contributed to by the killer cindy saw this individual as someone with very definite and fixed ideas ideas which he would want to disseminate also like most killers he would want his acts to be noticed the letters pages were a very likely source of clues cindy flicked open an issue of pagan quest dear sir i have been a worshipper of thor for over nine years and have recently moved to basingstoke where i am anxious to contact fellow pagans most of them unfortunately were on this level cindy wondered if there were any submitted letters that the editors of these magazines considered too extreme for publication hed had no reply from marcus bacton at the phenomenologist but perhaps that had not been such a great idea the journal only came out at three monthly intervals so even if its staid and ageing readers had any ideas it might be christmas before they appeared kelvyn who was that boy we met in gloucester who wanted to interview me long red hair jasper somebody wasnt it his mag was called no it wasnt jasper you stupid bird it was gareth gareth milburn and the mag was called cauldron crucible cindy leafed through a copy of a pagan magazine in which other smaller pagan magazines tended to place small ads here we are kelvyn crucible oh and a phone number theres unusual cindy prodded out the number on his mobile blessed be youre through to crucible leave a message and well get back to you one way or another ha ha ha gareth its cindy marslewis the humble thespian you were so determined to out as a pagan earlier this year cindy hung up unsatisfied restless there must be something else he could do whats your hurry old fool i dont know i feel cindy picked up his pendulum slipped a middle finger through the loop i feel its getting closer when held over the maps at each of the murder spots the pendulum reacted in exactly the same way a furious anticlockwise spin what would hatch say to that youre making it do that hed say scornfully even if youre not doing it consciously something inside you wants it to happen of all the extrasensory disciplines dowsing was the most widely accepted it began with the practical skill of waterdivining but noone knew where it ended how deep it would go in its search for hidden truths sometimes it seemed to be simply a way of communicating to your conscious mind something that you already subconsciously knew other times as the great t c lethbridge had first demonstrated it could be your link with different levels of existence and perhaps with some great cosmic database from which information could be gathered sometimes as cindy had found the pendulum would spin like a propeller a preliminary to shamanic flight as when hed held it over the spot in the elan valley in midwales where the barbedwire trap had been laid on a whim cindy spread out the pagan and earthmagic magazines in a circular fan formation and held the pendulum over the table he closed his eyes now he said tell me which one of these if any will guide me towards the person who killed maria capaldi emptying his mind letting conscious thoughts blow away like leaves knowing before he opened his eyes that the pendulum was spinning furiously but over the phenomenologist cindy was sceptical he was fond of the archaic publication although under the editorship of this man bacton it had become a little political even angry sometimes still there was always some message to be gleaned from the action of the pendulum perhaps it was time to telephone bacton but what about the big question he collected up all the magazines put them in a pile on the floor and opened up his map of britain on the tabletop he sat upright a hand on each knee the pendulum under his right hand he rotated his head a few times to relax the neck muscles did some brief tensing and relaxation on the arms and legs stomach and back and followed this with some chakrabreathing three times round the seven points until he felt light and separated and glowing then he began to visualize the islands from afar the sound of the sea and the gulls through the open window lifting him feeling the air currents under his wings flying over the new forest to the glade where a girl lay impaled across the scrubbed midwales hills to the flooded valleys following the line of the oakwood faster and faster into the sudden whiplash snap and twang of barbed wire spinning back across the english border the tension of offas dyke the flash of rivers the bulging of hills the bright hot grille of the ley lines towards clee hill and the timberframed market town above a cobbled street to a doorway bloodied cardboard in the pink dawn and up again and down the border until he felt three twitches from harolds stones and the choking terror of a girl thumbs in her larynx across the marlborough downs over old crop circles feeling the magnetic goosepimpling pull of the stillpulsing avebury henge hovering over a field he did not know where a faceless man lay under a mask of blood and then and then cindy felt his hand rising from his knee and the weight of the pendulum as it began to swing over the map he closed his eyes now where will it happen next later unnerved cindy telephoned marcus bacton editor of the phenomenologist marshwhat marslewis weve never spoken before but i pen the occasional piece for you under the name cindy the shaman oh my god look here mrs er lewis were a trifle oldfashioned at the phenomenologist correspondents who wish to communicate with us tend to put it in writing just wondering i was mr bacton if you had perused my letter regarding the murders oh hell look er lewis one doesnt want to bring down the heavy editorial hand but much as we value your contributions on celtic shaman practices this is not bloody true crime monthly no indeed i understand but i have personal reasons for continuing my investigations and it has occurred to me that you may be able to help me very much doubt that look im rather up to the bloody eyes i suspect the person im looking for see the murderer may well at some point have been in communication with your periodical oh right youre saying one of our chaps is a bloody psycho i see well what about miss pinder the ectoplasm lady from chiswick i can just imagine her striding across the welsh moors with a fiftyfoot roll of barbed wire always this receptive are you mr bacton what no wonder your circulation is sinking so rapidly bloody hell look lewis i can do without this things are bloody fraught enough just at the moment for a start weve had a rather difficult death the phone seemed to freeze in cindys hand death it took nearly twenty minutes and several attempts by bacton to get him off the line but when cindy finally put down the phone he had learned how and where the housekeeper mrs willis had died and that she had been a very good woman a herbalist and a spiritual healer cindy retired to bed with several back numbers of the phenomenologist and franklin and jobs guide to prehistoric remains on the welsh borders he already had his suitcase packed xx marcus bacton raged quite a bit his way of dealing with grief bobby maiden decided obviously a huge hole in marcuss life now and the farmhouse seemed as much of a shell as the castle outside yet he never spoke of mrs willis as anyone more than the woman who had kept his home together and his only show of emotion was rage maiden had kept well out of the way while the paramedics were around leaving andy as the sole official witness to the old womans death if they hadnt taken her off the stone it would have looked suspicious as it was an experienced nurse with her when she died it was just another case of an elderly woman wandering away the way some elderly women did and collapsing from a stroke the day after mrs williss death andy had gone back to elham telling marcus shed return for the funeral examining maidens eye one more time ordering him to get a good nights sleep and he had no dreams no sweat and again two good nights he wanted to believe he was coming out of it he didnt dare death still hung over him but its shadow was less defined andy had bathed and repatched his eye with more gauze and tape the second day a small parcel arrived containing a black plastic eyeshield maiden put on the patch laid low blanked out the holiday cottage was a good place for it a former dairy with only three rooms and all the walls of whitewashed stone there was a small kitchen with a hotplate and grill and andy had left bread and soup and fruit he didnt see too much of marcus who was making funeral arrangements raging at the vicar who claimed his churchyard was full and mrs willis wasnt local anyway fat bastard marcus fumed know where hes from fucking croydon why dont you tell him who she was because i dont know who she was and thats official marcus shoved at him a letter from mrs williss solicitors in hereford shed left him five thousand pounds and requested that he should make no inquiries into her past nor in any way speculate publicly about her bloody typical unassuming to an almost perverse degree didnt even like being called a healer less than a year ago she cured amy at the pub of bloody skin cancer amy knew what it was the bloody doctors knew what it was mrs willis said it was just a rash and youve heard about anderson of course if you cant take the word of a trained nurse and me maiden wondered did she bring me back by proxy relaxed enough now to consider the possibility almost dispassionately he felt sorry about mrs willis of course he did just like the last hundred deaths the accidents the suicides the murders but in the end it wasnt his tragedy or was it why had he urged andy to get the old girl off the stone he didnt know then or now why had he felt so uncomfortable at the place you had to be careful in front of marcus not to call black knoll so noones going to know she was annie davies marcus held up the letter in frustration bastards he said maiden wasnt quite sure who he meant perhaps he meant everybody even though theyd agreed that he was bobby wilson marcuss nephew over for the funeral of a woman hed come to regard as a granny figure maiden never went down to the village instead he took long uneven walks among the hills around st marys across this strange no mans land between england and wales pink soil and stone autumn fires on the fields under the dark mantelpiece of the mountains lying down in the grass a west wind on his face he thought about the kind of things he wanted to respond to he thought about painting again and he thought about emma curtis the second night marcus banged on the cottage door to say andy was on the phone for him police had been waiting for her at home wondering if she had any idea of the whereabouts of their missing colleague about whom they were a little worried also wondering where shed been perhaps maiden took the call in marcuss study how did you handle it told them jesus god told em id spent the night wi a man friend refusing to disclose his name on account of he was a doctor and married nice one maiden said aw sure like they were gonny believe there was any doctor still young enough to work whod take up wi an old bat like me or that youd take up with a doctor knowing how tired they always are cheeky sod youre sounding better bobby two nights now did i no tell you about the air anyway i told this guy i had absolutely no idea where you might be and if they found you to bring you back at once on account we hadnt yet given your head the allclear maiden gazed into the flames jetting between flaking logs in marcuss woodstove who was this cid guy sergeant said he was a friend of yours mike beattie aye trust him at all no well i did say youd been very mixed up and restless and it was no big surprise to learn youd skipped out that all right for you thats fine just one thing maybe you could avoid ringing here from home call boxes are best aw hey come on they wouldnae they might maiden said they just might i mean if they already are doing were stuffed but these things can take time to fiddle amid the clutter on marcuss desk of beatenup mahogany lay a new hardback book with a dark cover and big silver lettering beyond roswell the paranoid decades and maybe i dont like to ask this but is there any way you could avoid coming down for the funeral they could follow me its possible well andy said bitterly if you explain to marcus dont imagine id be missed im no bloody good to her now am i when he put down the phone marcus was furiously polishing his glasses he put them on and glared through them maiden what kind of shit have you got that woman into putting himself between maiden and the stove he had on what seemed to be his usual leisurewear which included a long blue cardigan and a mustard bow tie it had grown dark outside and the fire accounted for most of the light in the room if youre going to use my house as some sort of bunker you can at least tell me precisely why am i going to wake up to find the place surrounded by some fucking task force with loud hailers and automatic rifles i think we can rule out the armed response unit maiden said but thats probably all we can rule out going to sit down are we maiden marcus smiled threateningly have a drink no thanks no good for head injuries apparently he found a sofa marcus dragged a bottle of teachers whisky and a tumbler from his desk and slumped with them into an easy chair by the stove white stuffing spurting out of the seat as though the chair was frothing at the mouth entertain me he said remembering that i spent thirty years interrogating schoolboys worlds most convincing liar the schoolboy well maiden sank into a dusty brocaded cushion the bottom line is i suspect my superior officer would like me out of the picture you are out of the picture youre eighty miles away if you mean dead maiden say it dead then why precisely maiden said for being possibly the only copper in elham division who hasnt at some time to some extent been on the take yes he thought it is that simple marcus leaned forward firelight gleaming fiercely in his heavy spectacles then he poured himself a scotch thats it then is it he said i mean do forgive me maiden but i was rather expecting something to test the imagination only later when marcus was too drunk and maudlin to handle and he was trudging across the yard to the cottage did maiden realize this hadnt been sarcasm correct me if im wrong maiden marcus holding out his tumbler and gazing into the whisky as if it was the true elixir of life but you snuffed it didnt you apparently and dear old anderson coaxed you back from the other place when everybody was ready to pull the plug have you bagged up and put in a big drawer or whatever they do doesnt that make you think i mean you now know that theres something beyond death does that not change your whole life utterly and completely doesnt it blow your mind doesnt it make you think here i am a snivelling little detective getting all worked up about a bunch of bent coppers when there are real mysteries all around mysteries so close so damned intimate that most people especially policemen never even focus on them big mysteries dont you ever feel overwhelmingly excited humble even he didnt want to answer that didnt want to confess to feeling in what was supposed to be his soul a coldness and a bleakness and a complete absence of hope marcus sank a quantity of whisky i was a teacher maiden never have guessed something happened to you like the thing that happened to mrs willis on high knoll on her thirteenth birthday now in all of the six decades of my life on planet earth while the way we live has changed and worsened out of all recognition i have never had anything that could be described as a vaguely mystical or paranormal experience which is why i run a spotty little magazine devoted to it if i had had any kind of experience id be out there living it doing things making things happen but then you know what they say about teachers maiden said after a barely respectful pause them as can do them as cant teach which is why people like you make me sick you died maiden you died and you came back and what the holy fuck are you doing about it xxi folklore there was a whole lot of it around the rollright stones matthew lyall said and most of it was pretty sinister stuff the circle sure looked sinister today with a black cloud the shape of a bathtub hanging over it and these stalky pines grayle never had liked pines they were too aloof blocked out the sun but never seemed to offer you shelter pines didnt care in contrast to some of the ruined stone circles shed seen in pictures the rollrights looked like a true circle almost too complete the stones packed in tight so it was like a wall in places matthews girlfriend janny oates said it was part of the folklore of the site that if you counted the stones you would never get the same number twice the circles known as the kings men matthew said that stone over there is the king stone and across there is a group of stones that used to be a burial chamber only its caved in and thats called the whispering knights the stones were weird the king stone was like a twisted tree stump and there were metal railings around it like it might break out the smaller stones in the circle were eroded like lumps of rotting cheese this site should have been surrounded by miles of forest and swamps and stuff and yet here it was among welltended fields barely a halfhour out of oxford ersula was here she said we wanted her to spend the night matthew said in the stones i said id be her therapeute but she wouldnt janny said which we thought was unusual matthew said considering how enthusiastic shed been you know in the end about the whole experiment janny and matthew were kind of cute they were very early twenties and engaged both scrubbed and shiny real childhood sweetheart types they wore identical shetland sweaters and finished off one anothers sentences as if theyd been married for years when was this grayle asked when was she here when did you last see her theyd both been on a university of the earth course when ersula was there now they were working weekends with something called the dragon project which was a longterm inquiry into anomalous levels of radiation and electromagnetism at selected ancient sites the rollrights was its main base which was fine for janny and matthew who lived nearby in the town of chipping camden three weeks janny flicked back her fine lightbrown hair where did she say she was going then matthew actually matthew said she seemed a little confused i think shed had what my father would call a mindblowing experience that was back at cefnybedd when we first met her ersula was very much the scientist and she was sort of poohpoohing all this stuff about earthenergies that janny and i knew existed because wed spent all our holidays going to hundreds of sites and you can just tell after a while you just walk into a circle and and whoosh grayle said sadly absolutely thats exactly it isnt it matthew i think well im certain that ersula came round to our way of thinking and that can be quite a shock to the system when you start off by not believing she was sort of wandering around the stones matthew said looking a bit starved as though she had a cold coming on or a chill i offered her some tea from our flask but she shook her head she was wearing this enormous parka with the hood up though it wasnt a bad day was it not like today matthew said i dont think well be sleeping out tonight jan grayle thought jeez i sure wouldnt like to sleep here she stepped out of the circle turned away just being near these grim broken stones solidified all her fears for ersula it was clear she hadnt told anyone on the course about her awful dream at black knoll the full details of which she couldnt even tell her own sister look matthew patted her arm i wouldnt worry about her you know i mean compared with well some of the people involved in earthmysteries are a bit bonkers to be honest but ersula really had her feet on the ground grayles father had said be careful not what shed expected shed imagined something like i never openly said this to you grayle but i hated that column i found it gross it gives me enormous pleasure that you outgrew it finally no nothing like that dr erlend underhill had never once mentioned the column hed copied out the addresses and phone numbers of two professors he knew history guys in oxford said he would call them to put them in the picture tell them she was on her way grayle said why because right now prehistoric studies in england was attracting a large number of crazies her father said you needed some backup a point of reference dad im an official badgewearing weirdo i can bond with crazies humour me her father said humourlessly and insisted on giving her five thousand dollars for airfares and accommodation this is family business keep me informed next shed gone to tough it out with the editor who to her dismay seemed entirely undisturbed at his unique new age columnists wanting to quit yeah he said nonchalantly i agree the columns been a mite tired of late what we can handle it inhouse maybe i got a couple new kids in the city room maybe we can give it a new slant he meant save money asshole all right she hadnt expected burton to plead but it still wasnt the exit shed imagined so shed had her last doughnut with lyndon you were right maybe i peaked held back the tears and took the first daytime flight out of jfk with a small suitcase and a strange lightness in the head the next night she was in woodstock the one jimi hendrix never played outside of oxford at the home of her fathers onetime associate a sixtyyearold ancient history professor called duncan murphy and his australian partner nancy chad a poet oh yes we know roger falconer duncan murphy said people tend to sneer these days because hes big on the box and making the most of it but thats us brits for you cant stand other peoples success of course wed all be doing pretty much the same in his place and he knows it and he does actually know his stuff these rather lucrative courses he runs he may have let the leyliners in but that doesnt mean he accepts what they have to say he listens thats all on the box and during the courses too no doubt he appears more liberal than he actually is which tends to be the best policy longtermcareerwise ive found grayle remembered the issue of the phenomenologist the almost unreadably dense journal which ersula had enclosed with her last letter the one with the frontpage editorial which read professor falconer boasts of his openminded approach to the paranormal in fact all his books show him to be a sneering sceptic and the exciting new venture at cefnybedd promises to be merely a cynical exploitation of genuine seekers people who unlike falconer are unafraid to venture into battle without their academic armour i was at a dinner party with him a couple of years ago nancy chad said and that actually wasnt my impression i thought he had a great passion for prehistoric people that seems a strange way of putting it but i cant think of a better one hell talk at length about the abilities weve lost that they possessed in abundance hes quite magnetic when he gets going i reckon hes closer to the leyliners than he admits how close to ersula grayle wondered ersula for whom knowledge could also be a great passion unlike me i just get crushes women always claim to know him better duncan murphy said disapprovingly anyway you can judge for yourself i got you a videotape of a couple of his programmes you wont mind if we dont watch it tonight the video cassette had a picture on the box of a lean suntanned man in denims and raybans his back to the great pyramid of giza thats good of you grayle said thanks your fathers done me many favours hes very proud of ersula you know im sorry thats not to say grayle smiled how old is falconer fiftyfive going on twentyfive keeps himself fit has to be said swims rides pilots his own chopper ah yes nancy chad said archly that as well some of my friends figure the guys biggest claim to fame is the one he cant keep in his pants for too long raising the question of casual sex the ersula that grayle knew didnt do casual anything for me shed say loftily if unoriginally the most erogenous zone is the mind oh sure grayle had said until it happens look duncan said i feel im not doing enough oh hey come on you probably need a more radical viewpoint than ours i didnt know whether to mention this but some of our neighbours their son and his girlfriend were on one of falconers courses they spend most weekends down at the rollrights messing about with magnetometers and things wont take you long to get there and itll give you a taste of what its all about you know what i think jannys face glowing with the need to be kind i think she needed to go away by herself and think everything through everything that happened to her i can see her in some oxford library matthew said hunched up with a laptop computer feeding everything puzzling it all out i can imagine her getting a book out of this not oxford matt more like hereford library i think shell have gone back to the welsh border she was obsessed with the dolmen at black knoll though personally i never thought it had much going for it not compared to avebury and well here why did she come here grayle asked oh janny looked as though she hadnt given this much thought well i suppose i mean she knew we were here most weekends and wed said to her you know please come over when your next course is finished and youve got some free time she just wanted to hang around and talk i suppose sort of loosen up the way you described her she doesnt sound at all loosened up she tell you much about her experiences with the dreaming thing well said matthew she asked us a lot of questions about our experiences like what whether wed ever been frightened janny said i mean we werent supposed to talk about our dreams or that would defeat the object of the exercise if someone was thinking about another persons dream and had the same one the idea is to find out what influence the site has on our subconscious and have you grayle said have you ever been scared matthew folded his arms not scared some of its sort of challenging in what way oh i cant tell you without should i tell her janny i mean its not as if she is actually involved go on then i met the guardian once that was here at least i presume it was the guardian every site has one you know in my dream i was over by the whispering knights and this old lady was there old lady janny spluttered oh well a hag she was pretty revolting actually she was wearing a sort of ragged cloak and she had terrible staring eyes and she um smelled pretty awful oh look im not sure i should be telling you this not here grayle said smelled i think its ok janny said i think she was supposed to be offputting guardians are youve got to demonstrate your resolve your intensity of purpose by standing up to them and you did didnt you matt well i didnt run away i just sort of tried to meet her eyes and then she sort of dissolved and that was when janny woke me to get it down on tape you still have the tape grayle said no this was a dragon project thing we did a transcript and then i dont know where it is so whats the difference between the dragon project and falconers stuff well the dragon project started it off the national dream survey thing its all going into a computer in california or somewhere to see if there are any correlations i suppose professor falconer sort of picked up on it what happened said janny is a chap called adrian fraserhale who was involved with the dragon project went to work for falconer as an expert on the sort of earthmysteries stuff and roger thought it was a good idea matthew said you mean grayle said carefully he thought it would attract people to his courses he isnt like that the kids said almost in unison matthew added i really think hes going to be the best thing that ever happened to the earthmysteries movement because hes part of the establishment i mean in archaeology he is the establishment if people like adrian can convince him that theres really another dimension to prehistoric science it could be the start of changing the whole of human thought right grayle said thinking i was here before everyones on the point of a major breakthrough so uh what conclusions do you draw from this guardian thing well matthew looked over his shoulder as though he thought this hag might be eyeing him from the edge of the circle i suppose this is a bit obvious but the legend of the rollrights is about this king not any specific king just a sort of regional chief who encountered the witch who controlled the land and its a bit like macbeth really the witch said to him that if he took seven long strides from here at this point matthew and janny looked at each other held hands said together if long compton thou canst see king of england thou shalt be bringing their joined hands up and down to the rhythm well matthew said the king thought this was going to be a pushover because he knew the village of long compton would come into view as soon as he reached the top of the rise only problem was when he got there this mound had arisen on the horizon and completely blocked his view screwed huh turned to stone actually the witch turned the king into what is now the kings stone over there and these are his men grayle looked around the cheesy circle planning to smile but it got overtaken by a shudder she offer you anything matthew if she ever did i hope i wouldnt be arrogant like the king i think actually she was telling me us that it was ok giving us her blessing were going to be married next week janny said well uh congratulations grayle was suddenly feeling very old we love it here as you can imagine its our part of the world the most mysterious part of our part of the world earthmysteries is about discovering your own heritage and this is ours thats why were doing it here theres a church out here grayle looked around no village visible no spire no tower but presumably long compton was just over the next mound no here silly in the circle jesus grayle said you guys are like witches oh good god no weve not gone pagan or anything though weve nothing against that obviously matthew said hurriedly but this is going to be a proper christian service theres a chap we know who was ordained and practised as a curate before he sort of dropped out as your father would say janny giggled actually he was a friend of my fathers used to turn up and camp on our sofa for days at a time and the old man got a bit annoyed but he is a real clergyman sort of grayle shook her head mystified my mothers a bit disgusted with us actually matthew said wanted the full church bit but they dont realize these places were the original churches i mean the number of churches actually built inside stone circles or in places where there used to be circles or on top of bronze age mounds i mean a holy place is a holy place energy is energy and something really joyous like a wedding is really giving some energy back to the earth the stones were all around janny and matthew like an open mouth full of decaying teeth grayle couldnt imagine there being joy here itd be lovely if you could come if youre still around janny said we did invite ersula but right grayle said dismally xxii on an evening like this the village was made of stone and smoke the first fires had been lit on the cottage hearths lit with abandon because the logpiles were high the first amber lights were showing in the cottages and an iceblue fluorescence stuttered from the deep freeze in the village shop easing the elderly morris minor across the stone bridge over the young but apparently seldom rebellious river monnow and into the core of the village cindy felt unexpectedly nervous and stopped a while with the windows cranked down to watch and listen and perhaps absorb through secret pores the essence an overcast sky october that most mysterious and numinous of months was really beginning to be october the land vibrating with the subtle lights of nearness the warped sign of the rams head creaked in the breeze perhaps it would be best to stay there tonight if there was a room available and above it all the warm clangour of bell practice was there to sustain and protect the ancient spirit like cupped hands over a candle it was a night to drink cider and drowse by the inglenook in the pub to the mellow thud of darts and the rumble of country laughter but not for cindy who was here to investigate a death no wonder that when he had asked the pendulum where will it happen next it had not responded to the welsh border because it had already happened and this time there was nothing particularly suspicious an old lady had wandered away disoriented no doubt and died of a stroke no intensive police investigation no forensics no scenes of crime people no orange tape cindy would be free to examine marcus bactons beloved high knoll burial chamber without either being interrupted or the risk of further falling foul of the constabulary perhaps an hour of daylight remained he would go at once to find out if he could how a place of light had become a place of death for you marcus thrust the phone through a morass of books and typescript some woman with mrs willis gone the study was a mess unwashed teacups and biscuit crumbs stuck to used whisky glasses verging on the squalid even worse than maidens flat but his offer to help clean the place up had led to a brusque invitation to fuck off back to the cottage and keep his nose out the inquest had been opened and adjourned very rapidly no uncomfortable questions everyone apparently accepting as maiden had thought they would that old dears sometimes died in unusual places so the body was available for burial throwing marcus into a state about how the hell you organized a funeral who you invited all this sort of bloody palaver a woman asking somewhat coyly in my view for a mr lazarus marcus said for maiden the squalor instantly mellowed to somewhere around cosily chaotic still alive then emma curtis said now he was alive where you calling from yeah dont worry i got that message your fairy godmother the rottweiler of elham general weve had coffee a couple of times she thought you were being paranoid not me baby i know these reptiles too well hence im in the phone booth inside the public bloody library late night opening listen i just popped into the reading room for a glance at the elham messenger just out it says hang on let me fold the thing it says your condition is giving cause for concern and youre believed to have been transferred to some specialist neurological unit in brum unnamed naturally im a cabbage also the paper suggests the police are having second thoughts about a hitandrun its believed there is a real possibility that no third party was involved looks like you fell off the kerb bobby pissed again i expect bloody riggs whos that guy he knows at the messenger roger gibbs what it is gibbs is next in line for grand worshipful thingy at the lodge simple as that or so vic says vic knows these things hey you sound better all the better as they say for hearing you perhaps er perhaps we need to meet do you think discuss the whole situation in greater depth the whole situation are you up to discussing the whole situation in depth maiden said really oh well no hang on theres a bloke outside just a bloke i think but we cant be too careful well yes i thought i could come down take you for a little outing uncle that would be very nice my dear when might one expect to be exposed to your delightful company tomorrow ah we do have a funeral tomorrow well maybe you might need cheering up after that change of scene what if i were to make a reservation for you and a friend at some primitive but homely b and b for tomorrow night would that help your recovery hey the good sister said shed sent you a black eyepatch why do we find black eyepatches dead sexy bobby can you tell me i mean long john silver down the steep lane went the intrepid morris minor putter putter putter it was like going down a rabbit hole the banks high each side trees growing from the tops of the banks and tangling overhead filtering the already meagre light through a dark green grille at the bottom you could almost miss the house the way the singletrack road swung round to the right and the house was down a short track on the left treescreened cindy stepped on the brakes and backed up ornate gold lettering on a black board read cefnybedd the university of the earth cindy saw lights coming on in the house behind the trees what were they up to there the university of the earth most of what he knew about this enterprise had been gleaned from the obviously biased pages of the phenomenologist it did though sound more than a little irresponsible offering to connect students and holidaymakers to the inner mind of the planet it would seem entirely innocuous of course to falconer an academic a sceptic a man who apparently believed there was nothing out there more powerful than his own intellect how could these people know so much and yet so little cindy had read some of the mans learned articles but not seen his apparently more populist television programme life was too short to spend in the company of sceptics round the corner past falconers farmhouse went the venerable car and onto a track of stone and dirt emerging into an open field sheep nibbling around the fringes it was bisected by a rough path which began as a sheeptrack a narrow muddied depression and then turned to concrete before widening into a big flat apron from the sky this would look like a giant frying pan like a landing area for ufos a big new shed had gone up too and the whole damn thing across not only the path but the path the principal ley line itself leading through two dinky little round barrows and a standing stone to dore abbey itself how utterly crass of the man but the concrete apron was out of sight of the house so cindy parked on the edge of it and set off on foot with his little case it was important in a situation like this to weave in and out of the path of power the spiritway if you followed it directly you were advertising yourself to the denizens of other planes and might therefore attract all manner of unnecessary hangerson how fortunate little annie davies had been on that morning just the right side of adolescence the innocent side and due also no doubt to a rare and fortuitous pattern of circumstance exposed to only the right the very rightest elements and so her young life was blessed marcus bacton had written that each time he walked to the knoll it was a kind of pilgrimage he believed it was a naturally blessed place but of course there was no such thing some points on the earth because of their geophysical properties and their positioning in relation to the sun and the stars might be termed places of power but power was not holiness and holiness was not an inherent quality it could be visited upon a place but it required maintenance and there was certainly no sense of holiness here this evening senses racing ahead of him cindy followed the path up the side of high knoll or black knoll as it was called on the map why was that why black a reference to the black mountains or something more sinister under a windblasted hawthorn tree was a small staked sign black knoll once a long barrow this chambered tomb dates from at least bc and appears to have been oriented to the midsummer sunrise a monumental feat of neolithic engineering its capstone now damaged has been estimated to weigh nearly thirty tons evidence of several burials was found during an excavation in no mention naturally of the vision of annie davies the stones were on a small exposed plateau like an island now in the misty rain cindy stopped he could see the huge capstone unbalanced and yawning like the open mouth of an alligator where mrs willis had lain to die the stones glistening with damp and ancient magic there was a stout new fence and barbed wire a gate in the fence was padlocked but someone had cut the wire and two of the horizontals had been taken out was this before or after the tragic death of mrs willis cindy crouched in the damp yellowed grass and went into the quiet for a moment wondering how best to approach no birds sang the grey sky hung low and heavy like a giant mattress a stroke was such a convenient way to go it was rarely possibly to diagnose how precisely the stroke had been brought on had mrs willis overexerted herself getting here or had she been badly frightened by something or someone cindy hitched up his tweed skirt and climbed over the damaged fence and walked with undeniable trepidation towards the burial chamber was this like primitive or was this primitive ok there was no sawdust on the floor grayle had heard some english pubs still had sawdust on the floor but the waldorf it was not the bedroom had a bed with an iron frame and a washbasin you could see the pipes coming out of and then snaking down this hole in the floor it did not of course have a bathroom en suite and no phone on which to call room service and have them bring up a selection of the sweating pork pies and potato chips on sale in the saloon bar it actually said saloon bar on the frosted glass door or call a doctor to treat your food poisoning and your insomnia grayle had been to britain twice before in her life that is shed stayed in london and bath and stratforduponavon and all these places were overcrowded but elegantly civilized as you might expect but civilization seemed to end at hereford even the roads shed hired this small rover car in oxford spent some time getting over the problems of driving on the left but most of the roads hereabouts those problems didnt arise they were so narrow you just drove right down the middle and closed your eyes and headed for the hedgerow when someone came the other way scared she was going to trash the hire car grayle had parked outside the first building resembling a hotel she came to after crossing the st mary sign and checked in for two nights the rams head maybe a mistake grayle rested her ass on the edge of the bed which was like a goddamn girder and hoped it would take no longer than a day to establish if anyone in the village or the course centre cefnybedd however the hell you pronounced that knew of ersulas present location first thing shed done on arrival was to use the phone gave the landlady a tenpound note and called up her dad at the ivory tower and no no his favourite daughter had not arrived home or written or phoned he sounded busy grayle looked out of the window at the stone houses the church tower ancient beautiful serene but the cottages had tv aerials a couple had satellite dishes the village shop would rent out videos of tarantino movies and st marys was doubtless full of people with cute country accents thinking god i could reallyve made something of myself if i lived in the states feeling suddenly terribly lonely grayle keeled over on the bed clutching her favourite quartz crystal what if spirituality was just a human fabrication and lifes real peaks were getting drunk and getting laid what if it was like that cindy straightened his tweed skirt and opened his case meeting the gaze of kelvyn kite the birds glass eyes glittering malevolently silly old tart he scowled at kelvyn and felt beneath the feathers for his drum his beautiful bodhran made with deerhide stretched and patterned dubbed and tightened until the skin was a membrane the membrane between worlds he decided not to bother with the feathered cloak too ostentatious what he was wearing would surely suffice cindy had come in his female aspect arising this morning on the seaward side of the bed to bathe in st brides bay softening the body with powder and lavender water shaving his legs before dressing in sensible countrywomans clothing leaving wales as a woman entering england as a woman if high knoll were to be coaxed into giving up her secrets there was no other way for this was where annie davies had been granted a vision of the highest female divinity a feminine place a goddess site the lady of light it didnt matter who she was holy virgin sungoddess or alien being was a symbol of rightness of the moment the time the person the location cindy sat upon the earth in the passageway of open stones leading to the chamber and began with his fingers and the heel of his hand to drum himself into separation this was the meeting place the place of the confluence of many paths he began to chant to the hollow rhythmic resonance of the old drum meeting place meeting place here the sky here the earth here the mountain here the valley here albion here cymru meeting place time passed the chant died cindy listened to the evening breeze to the birds in the distance the only birds were distant to the waving of the grass he felt the weight of the capstone on the uprights and the strength of the earth which bore the stones he collected all the sounds inside himself in his head and in his breast and in his solar plexus he breathed the sounds into his chakras carried them around his inner circuit and let them go and began another chant here the sky here the earth here the mountain here the valley here cindy here annie here mrs willis time passed cindy was aware only of a faraway longing and an ache in his stomach when his eyes opened again for an agonizing second the sky was very nearly black and the stones were the colour of candlewax he didnt move he took it calmly at first it had happened before a whole scene changing into a photographic negative clouds becoming smoke muddy rivers running like double cream green grass turning pink as watered blood it had happened before but never with a smell the smell was rank and feral of pond slime and decayed leaves with a smear of faeces cindy was deeply shaken his hands felt as if theyd been in cold water the woman in him felt violated holiness a tender and vulnerable quality could also be negated reversed all too easily all too easily beside the stone three yards away a figure stood in greenblack smoke and looked down on cindy whose fingers fell from the drum who sprang up in fear stumbling away down the side of the knoll coughing into a handkerchief soaked this morning in lavender water fleeing in terror from high knoll where little annie davies had been granted a vision of the highest female divinity high knoll was a feminine place a goddess site was xxiii amy jenkins whose name was over the door of the rams head was very neat very dark and very valleys cindy could tell by the little black juliette greco dress and all the gold bangles and necklaces so he shook out his own bangles and stripped down to his glittery highnecked top and it was as if theyd known each other years quakers yard i am born and bred amy said abercynon cindy lied never dont know dusty morgan do you he havent lived there mind for thirty years poor old dusty tegwyn bogart well that wasnt his real name but he could curl his lip brilliant tegwyn could and it went on like this in the notverybusy saloon bar of the tup as it was known cindy having played enough of the south wales clubs to busk it needing this needing to be frivolously female for an hour or so to clean out his system after the dark green malodorous male evil of the knoll he learned that amy jenkins had been in st marys less than two years after half a lifetime in the licensing trade around merthyr and nearly half a lifetime being married to someone called that bastard always wanted a little country pub she had and she was going to turn this place into something more like it soon as her settlement came through cindy adjusted scattercushions on the old oak settle feeling a little calmer after a couple of rum and peps come across marcus bacton have you marcus said amy you know marcus friend of a friend said cindy said id look him up see only i didnt like to just walk in things being as they are the bereavement terrible amy shook her head vigorously polishing a pint glass a wonderful lady mrs willis wonderful she leaned over the bar whispered loud enough to be heard in the street had the gift clairvoyance cindy said innocently healing two years ago had a rash i did on my back too much sunbathing see well you never think thats going to happen do you doctors gave me up for cheltenham so i went to see mrs willis because you hear things running a pub she says ill promise nothing mrs jenkins well cured not a speck remarkable said cindy and she was his housekeeper well you know amy did the big whisper again there was something strange there some folk said she was his mother well no family resemblance at all from where i stood but she obviously meant something to marcus more than a housekeeper more than that cindy having been aware for a minute or so of being listened to half turned on his barstool and saw a pretty blonde girl sitting alone in the very corner of the bar her head bent over a book but she wasnt reading she was listening to every word they said amy was talking about marcus bactons feud with the famous archaeologist professor falconer wouldnt kick him out of my trench but him and marcus daggers drawn worse it is since falconer bought some more land and now he owns the ancient monument up on black knoll hes bought the knoll and he didnt want marcus keep messing about up there so he fenced it off see and then mrs willis poor old thing pint of tankard is it colin cindy noticed the book the blonde girl was reading it was a new copy of lines on the landscape by devereux and pennick well well what was this he looked pointedly at the girl good book is it she looked up from her book she looked momentarily scared big eyes ley lines cindy said you believe in all that come to the right place you have old alfred watkins of hereford he used to walk these hills spotting how the stones aligned with the mounds and the old churches i uh i only just started it an american accent i bought it on the way here i dont know much about ley lines and stuff we uh we dont have them in new york as far as you know cindy said mysteriously as far as you know well uh we have like straight roads but i guess straight roads dont qualify by virtue of just being uh straight well cindy put on his famous twinkle there are i hear many strange energies in new york who knows how many new leys might have been created you think thats possible anything said cindy is possible its a very strange world gee the girl said do all you people talk like this cindy laughed sadly very few of us talk like this can i buy you a drink cindy my name cindy marslewis grayle underhill grail how interesting as in kind of she said you died and you came back and what the holy fuck are you doing about it marcuss outraged voice asked the question in maidens head at least a couple of times a day im trying to forget about it thats what im doing marcus what did you say marcus threw a log on the stove nothing it seemed to maiden that unless he managed to push the experience right to the back of his mind he was never going to have a normal life thered be no pressure to go back to work maybe he could crawl back to elham general in a few days time and persuade some specialist that the brain damage was irreparable and would affect his equilibrium in some problematic fashion demanding early early retirement and making him to the satisfaction of riggs a very unreliable witness would riggs feel safe then would maiden feel safe safe to go to art college finally did he even want to do that any more marcus sat down with his whisky youll be there tomorrow maiden sure dont have to you know if theres a problem i cant avoid death for ever can i besides i was there when she yes marcus swallowed some whisky ive been thinking about that thinking back to when mrs willis was lying on the stone and you said take her down get her down why did you say that i dont know and the statement scared him because it was so completely true there was an area of himself that he really didnt know it was like carrying around a locked briefcase to which you didnt have the key and you couldnt put it down because there might be a bomb inside perhaps somethings reaching you maiden when anderson brought you back from the dead she was imagining on the knoll at sunrise that sets up a connection not only between her and you but between you and the knoll now dont look at me like that you cynical bastard maiden shook his head he wasnt going for this did you know that burial chamber is a serious misnomer marcus said they were really initiation chambers yes all right the remains of the dead funerary urns and things were put in there but that was part of it the trainee shaman or whoever would spend the night inside the chamber and then when the light came through directly through the slit at midsummer they would literally be enlightened their consciousness raised andy told me did she also tell you how similar that was to the neardeath experience hmm the shaft of light out of complete darkness thats what they see isnt it not me marcus quite if you saw only darkness and you felt only cold that would account for your reaction to the knoll wouldnt it possibly im not qualified not long before she died the old girl told me she was seeing black lights up there can you have black lights like to talk in metaphors your psychics she was saying somethings gone wrong perhaps falconers fucked it up with his bloody experiments perhaps the light that came into you from the knoll was black light dont do this to me marcus im trying to help you you ungrateful bastard have a drink you look completely shot at do you know why its called black knoll local name for it but why exactly some bollocks its irrelevant you going to tell me just have a drink marcus said missing this cindy said what do you mean missing i mean she never came home or if she did she didnt make contact either way thats missing isnt it like shes missing out of my life it wasnt alcohol making her talk grayle was drinking coke or something that passed for it just she was getting past the stage of keeping quiet about who she was and what she was doing here how many woman tourists travelled alone anyway the strange old dame dressed like out of agatha christie only more glitter took in everything she said spoke in this light flippant voice with a bizarre upanddown accent and yet struck grayle as being kind of heavy underneath what did i walk into here did she find me or did i find her grayle swallowed an ice cube from the bottom of her coke told this cindy all about the dreaming after a while they bought more drinks and took them to a table at the back of the bar and grayle pulled out the sheaf of airmail paper see my sister shes intense and hardnosed not easily fooled but the dream thing had become like a personal obsession yes cindy said after she read the letter except for the pages grayle always held back no matter how analytical you are experiments with the subconscious can be rather like putting a needle into a vein the subconscious demands more ancientsitedreaming is dangerously addictive grayle looked into cindys still green eyes how do you know this ah cindy sighed ten fifteen years ago before it was fashionable i decided to spend a night on the fabled slopes of cader idris cader what is that its a mountain in north wales where theres a legend that if you spend a whole night there you will wake up either a poet or mad sounds kind of like greenwich village cindy smiled gave me the taste for it i slept around once dreamed for seven nights either side of the full moon under one of the trilithons at stonehenge that was in the days when you were still allowed inside oh yes positively promiscuous i was wow grayle said faintly it does change you most of my dreams became lucid dreams the ones where you know youre dreaming where you seem to have an element of control sure dream control i did a column on it and of course thats when it becomes risky you think youre in control but in fact your subconscious mind is starting to influence your conscious mind to an alarming degree you think youre drawing inspiration from god or the earth mother the mind of gaia depending on your religious or your scientific persuasion like with acid trips indeed and it can send you quite mad i wasnt happy about it so i stopped doing it a shaman must above all have discipline be able to count on precision cindy smiled regretfully grayle sat back in her chair against the ancient grimy panelling through the brown smoky air she examined the weird old broad from the purple hair to the chiffon scarf to the tweed skirt and the blackstockinged legs hold on just one moment grayle said you said shaman the tribal shaman was the witch doctor the priest the counsellor the psychiatrist the one who interceded with the spirit world yeah we have them collect native american hand drums and feathers supervise sweatlodges for overweight executives we all have to make a living grayle an actor i am by profession not a terribly successful one but ive had my moments quite well known i was at one time on childrens television straight man to the more famous kelvyn kite we never crossed the atlantic sadly but then perhaps a fourfoottall talking bird of prey would have been a little esoteric for the american market holy jesus grayle thought would somebody wake me up always good with animals i was cindy said wistfully made kelvyn myself i did so you youre a shaman right an english shaman celtic shaman if you dont mind our oral tradition goes back to taliesin the bard in the sixth century and further to the builders of the dolmens and the stone circles as for me i trained for three years on and off with dilwyn fychan of machynlleth and other individuals too private to be mentioned it was a calling some of us are called some of us are aware from an early age that we are different cindy crossed his legs the shaman traditionally has a foot in two worlds flits about passes from one sphere of existence to another a condition usually reflected in his personal life and mode of dress neither one thing nor the other cindy smiled grayle stared oh she said youre uh like a guy right prehistoric sites were often misused marcus said still are satanic rites and all that nonsense but this was nothing like that this was a social thing ultimate degradation for an executed criminal making an example maiden drank some whisky his first since the last night of his old life used to do something similar with highwaymen marcus said gibbets by the roadside nothing so romantic on the welsh border these were sheepthieves or domestic murderers chap comes home drunk clobbers his wife with a bottle seedy stuff thats what makes it worse really shows a contempt for the site so what did they do you all right maiden just carry on go on theres a fairly honourable tradition a prehistoric tradition known as excarnation laying out of corpses on some hillside to free the spirit to the natural elements this was different obviously you cold maiden youre shivering marcus gathered up a log opened the door of the woodstove orange splinters flew up when he tossed in the new log maiden didnt feel any warmer they laid the body of the executed criminal on its back on the capstone for the crows and buzzards to pick clean the foxes to plunder the bones when was this i dont know when it started it went on amazingly until early in the nineteenth century this was a harsh place maiden maiden drained his glass reached for the bottle but marcus took it thats what black knoll recalls i hated it thats why they all rejected annies vision because it was a place of the rotting dead marcus but she purified it maiden what happened to her restored the sacredness the locals had been desecrating it for centuries it was a bad place a diseased place somewhere you didnt go that parents warned their children about and this child she restored this ancient site to what it was intended to be a place of light marcus dont make too much of this but i think i dreamt about it what marcus shook back his heavy grey hair pushed his glasses into place when hospital i thought i was waking up but it was another dream it was like an open tomb i was the corpse decaying i had no eyes i could feel the birds plucking oh shit marcus i dont marcus took maidens glass and poured him more whisky xxiv around midnight the bulb in the bedside lamp began to sing close to one am it blew leaving cindy to sit in the darkness in his dressing gown and ponder the vexed question of whether or not he was as kelvyn kite had often stated simply a stupid old tart the american girl had made an excuse and fled fairly rapidly after discovering that the person to whom she had unburdened herself was not only old enough to be her mother but also old enough to be her father as it were he hadnt meant to startle her he wanted to help her what if her poor sister had been no dont even think of it what if all those what ifs what if the good and patient chief inspector peter hatch had been right all along and there were simply several common or garden sad uncomplicated killers out there rather than one person harbouring a warped and lethal obsession with earthmagic what if his own exercise in pendulum dowsing over the maps and the journals had been as spurious as the shamanic powers of which he was so pathetically proud what if tonights paranormal experience at the high knoll burial chamber was no more than a perverse and futile combination of paranoia and wishful thinking what if sydney marslewis was no more than an old humbug of the most ludicrous kind trying to make something significant out of his sexual ambivalence and social inadequacy unable to face up to his reduced status as a failed actor relegated to the end of the pier with a stuffed bird well these were hardly new questions indeed one night in a dressing room in scarborough about seven years ago he had almost given way to an impulse to hang himself by his dressinggown cord from an overhead heating pipe wearily he climbed out of bed and switched on the central light which was half smothered by grimy beams an old manicdepressive you are boy thats the only certainty from his suitcase he took the fax hed received just before leaving the caravan from gareth milburn at crucible the pagan magazine hed asked the boy for information about the readers letters he didnt print modern pagans ever anxious to promote a positive image of their faith as a pure and caring naturereligion would almost invariably reject the propaganda received from the darker practitioners gareths fax said we get fairly regular letters from something called the black temple of set with a milton keynes postmark accusing us of being wimps who are scared to discover where the real power lies theres a crank who just calls himself the green man postmarks from all over the country so it could actually be a bunch of people who reckons the pagan federation lost its way when it turned its back on blood sacrifice and claims blood sports are a vital part of our heritage theres also this is really sick a woman with an omen fixation offering to have babies for use in satanic rites at very competitive rates if i can find any on the spike ill fax them the green man was the one which lingered there must be a dozen black temples of set their adherents also attended heavy metal concerts the green mans enthusiasm for blood sports unfashionable reactionary and anathema to modern pagans would certainly provide a motive for the ritual killing of maria capaldi and motive cindy thought was important here these were not entirely psychotic killings behind them was a belief structure however warped gareths theory that the green man might be a group of people was interesting this would account for the different methods of slaughter the green man seemed promising from the start and that was the problem the green man had been in cindys thoughts from the moment he left home to drive across wales to the black mountains the image of the archetypal gargoyle with foliage foaming from his mouth and nose and sap in his veins had nested in cindys mind which would explain for sure the dark and frightening image he had seen on the periphery of his vision at the height of his shamanic ritual at the knoll he had conjured in his head the smoky form a thoughtform nothing more a message from himself to himself utterly terrifying but completely unreliable there came a tapping at the door cindy jumped in alarm and dropped the fax paper who is it shocked at the elderly quaver in his shrunken voice cindy an even smaller voice its me grayle i saw the light under your door tell me to go away if this is inconvenient cindy smiled in relief and went to open the door no my love an old insomniac i am the american girl stood there in jeans and an overlong sweatshirt with her hair loose she looked all of nineteen and somewhat waiflike a mistake it was to assume that all americans were brimming with selfconfidence im sorry she said all that shaman stuff and then finding out you were a guy and all it kind of fazed me out no me it is who should be sorry just an old misfit i am really but i do have a kettle would you care for a cup of tea grayle found a grin from somewhere also a small sheaf of folded airmail paper i thought about what you said about dreams and ancient sites turning people crazy this uh this is the rest of the letter from my sister the part i dont show people maiden awoke not breathing his mouth was full of solid gritty darkness when he tried to breathe the air couldnt get through his throat was also tightpacked and bulging and when he tried to cough he just took more of it into his lungs and there was a meagre wheezing sound fighting for the cough tautened his muscles and made his body curl and jerk as if he was struggling inside a straitjacket but the cough wouldnt come out just built up and locked and he went into a blind panic and rolled out of bed over and over on the floor numbed fingers tearing at his throat cindy made some tea on the dressing table and while it was brewing read the last pages from ersula underhill in which the girl described her dream of lying on the stone shoulder to shoulder with a decaying body scary fun grayle oh dear grayle sat at the foot of the bed hands clasped between her knees clearly unsure of quite how seriously to take all this reading the letter had told cindy a lot about the two sisters how they differed in their beliefs and perceptions grayle was the insecure one the scatty one it must have taken a great deal of determination for her to come here and a deal of anxiety too she looked up at him i met some people at the rollright stones oh yes this guy he said sometimes you would encounter in your dreams what he called guardians is that what i think it is the genius loci sometimes but many guardians have been created by people using these places for worship elemental spirits ritual stones are like computers spiritual entities are stored there for centuries sometimes even millennia to deter robbers and vandals right and so anyone sleeping at an ancient site should not be surprised to encounter one the deliberate act of dreaming is an invasion and the guardian would be programmed as it were to react the guardian by nature is a fearsome apparition which can be dangerous strong nerves are called for well sure ersula has strong nerves but however cindy said this doesnt sound like a guardian to me more of a traceimage an ancient site usually holds more than one strand of history see for instance in the dark ages we have old shrines taken over by somewhat degenerate druidic cults not averse to human sacrifice this could very well be a flashimage from some sort of blood sacrifice grayle said you know what really scares me about this country its all so close so near the surface its near the surface in many parts of the earth cindy poured tea its just that here so little has altered visually over the centuries that our imaginations do not have to work so hard my imagination is kind of like an untrained dobermann most of the time you have to forcibly restrain it cindy smiled look lovely you trusted me i shall trust you this particular site is referred to by two names high knoll and black knoll and they seem to reflect two sides of it good and evil possibly as simple as that probably not the concepts of good and evil seldom apply in this sphere i was thinking more of male and female the female side represented by the vision of the virgin mary itself reestablishing a link with the earliest sunworship at the site and then we have the male element linked perhaps to the bloodier aspect right grayle accepted a cup of tea and held it on her knees but where is this headed are we saying that ersula who we know was charmed by the idea of the virgin appearing at this stone age site are we saying she inadvertently let herself in for something old and bad this letter was the last you heard you dont know when she left here i know that some time after she wrote this she was wandering around in a kind of dislocated state she met these people at the rollright stones theyre nice the people not the stones no those stones have their problems why did she go there i guess she had something on her mind maybe she was looking for friends someone to confide in but maybe if something bad happened to you in connection with prehistoric remains these people matthew and janny maybe theyre not the kind of people to help you theyre real friendly obliging all of that but a little uh enthusiastic kind of naive i guess anything bad theyd tell you you had it wrong have you been yet to see mr falconer i figured id go tomorrow i wanted to gather as much background as i could before i confronted the guy he sounds kind of formidable so i believe actually i was given a videotape of his tv programme which i hoped to view before i went over there on account i dont even know what he looks like but this place doesnt appear to be equipped with the necessary hardware i should quite like to view that too cindy said thoughtfully i travel around too much to see much television i wonder if marcus bacton has a video machine marcus bacton yeah i need to talk with him too maybe i need to spend another day here look ok grayle focused on cindy over the rim of her white teacup you know why im here why are you here ah cindy needed time to think it would take too long well talk tomorrow after i see mr bacton oh ok grayle put her cup on the floor uh this guardian traceimage whatever i mean they cant harm you these things can they not not physically no probably not physically but they can fuck up your head i suppose yes as you so charmingly put it i suppose they can fuck up your head but thats not what really worries you is it cindy lay in bed again with the light out it would be dawn soon no matter he didnt need much sleep these days the green man the oldest guardian stern defender of the earth just talking it out with grayle underhill had made it so much clearer in his mind he could almost feel the green man writhing there and grayles sister was missing am i quite mad cindy wondered before sleep consented to take him please god let me be mad xxv this is how it goes grayle thought struggling with the zipper on her jeans this is how it happens outside the window morning rinsed the pink stone of the village so you do something rash and you wind up in a strange place youre lonely and anxious and it all seems so futile this is when youre at your most vulnerable this is how rich empty widows wind up backing halfassed business deals and homeless kids get sucked into fruitcake religious sects somebody is kind to you is how it starts deep into the night somebody wants to listen just that by daylight the whole idea of a crossdressing actorventriloquist who believed he was into a mystical tradition with a direct line to the megalithbuilders seemed a whole lot less convincing than it had last night plus why should cindy suddenly pick up on her in a bar what was he doing here anyway and why had he not wanted to tell her last night if he was looking up his old friend marcus bacton why was he staying at the inn and why was he alone grayle felt calmer and stronger this morning she would investigate the university of the earth she would do it objectively and efficiently she would find out what it was that had so seduced ersula but she would resist its allure and cindys get wise grayle moved down the dark twisty stairs to chase up a small breakfast before seeking out cefnybedd put some distance whats up with you maiden marcus dangerously dug a fork into the toaster to retrieve a fractured slice i mean what the bloody hell is up you look like you havent slept thats because i havent slept oh shit marcus held the toaster upside down and a million dry crumbs came out on the stone worktop at the sight of the blackened heap maiden erupted into dry coughs and stumbled to his feet to run himself a glass of water marcus brushed the debris to the floor and carried the toast to the table on the end of a fork thats it he sat down that is fucking it malcolm the dog ambled over checked out the ancient crumbs sniffed and turned away maiden drank the water slowly had a piece for the magazine yesterday marcus unwrapped a pack of hard chilled butter woman in norfolk claims actual fairies have been performing scenes from a midsummernights dream in her bloody greenhouse been a subscriber since what do i do with that offer her the editorship marcus stared at him you may be right ill bury mrs willis today full honours be as nice as i can to the relatives if any turn up and then she have any children niece in hay another in allensmore one of them i cant remember which thinks she might make it to the funeral but if mrs willis was annie davies then therell be a few cousins and second cousins in the village but did they know and if they did will they admit it old prejudices die hard places like this ill bury her and then thats it what is get out piss off surrender the phenomenologist to the mad biddies put this place on the market must be some appeal in a castle even if the house is disintegrating maiden filled the kettle set it down on the stove maybe falconer would buy it thank you maiden over my dead fucking body rather flog it as an outwardbound centre for your tenyearold carthieves marcus was suddenly sunk into profound misery bloodhound eyes blurring behind his glasses went into the bloody healing room late last night core of the house for the past year all those bottles and jars with mrs willis around they were full of mystery potions and elixirs all drawing energy from her full of a sort of condensed lifeforce and at the same time youd feel this overwhelming peace and calm in there now its just old bottles full of dead and rotting gunge have to put them all in bin bags take them to the tip ill do it if you like marcus shook his head splattering butter on a fragment of brittle toast if theres a message in those bottles maiden its for me i look at my life i mean is that fucking it standing in a desert surrounded by graves celia little sally mrs willis possibility of seeing them agains about all there is to look forward to you get to my age youre sixty maiden protested unless of course your own version of the other side is the truth of it marcus said in which case were all stuffed arent we there was the sound of tyres on the forecourt marcus dropped his burnt toast maiden saw someone getting out of a very old but beautifully polished black morris minor woman late middleage mauvy hair tweed skirt kind of mohair sweater with white woolly lambs on the front gold earrings necklaces bangles sounds hellish marcus said if we keep quiet maybe itll go away might be one of mrs williss nieces it certainly wasnt a policeman so maiden made for the front door and dragged it open before the woman had time to knock it was a strange moment she just stood there looking at him for several seconds she was as tall as he was she had the small glittering eyes of a bird of prey well she said at last youre not marcus bacton are you lovely a long flattopped hill like a bed with a pillow of trees at one end grayle headed toward the trees as directed by amy jenkins the landlady remembering what ersula had written about the curious magic of this place she came to a plain farm gate and it was open walked through and suddenly like wow there was below her this unbelievably beautiful rambling mellow stone house spread out like a sleeping lion the kind of country house they tried to clone in beverly hills and failed because the result was just too movieset perfect high walls suggested gardens with fishpools and stuff typically because the house was irrelevant to what went on there ersula had never referred to it except as the center it looked more of a home than an educational establishment which explained why ersula and the others had had apartments over the stables and why folks on the courses needed accommodation in the village couldnt be more than five or six bedrooms in the house itself and just one car parked in front a rebuilt vw beetle pink a squirrel scampered past otherwise no sign of life clouds were gathering and it looked like more than a gesture she shouldve come in the car but walking a couple of miles gave you a handle on a place fall was setting in the first dead leaves curling together on the brown gravel as she tried because there were no other options the huge solid ironstudded door tugging a bell pull on a black chain she stepped back in alarm when it responded with this deep churchy tolling way back into the house and grayle thought in a kind of terror suppose the door opens and its ersula ersula in a bathrobe hair mussed and smelling of recent sex but there was no ersula no answer at all and no use in ringing again there was no way anyone in the house would have failed to hear grayle was curious emboldened by the likelihood of there being noone here at all she wandered around the side of the house to peer over the stone wall it was too high around nine feet but it had a door in it a smaller replica of the front door going to a gothic point there was a ring handle she turned it waited holding her breath nobody came out with a shotgun or two snarling mastiffs on a chain she pushed her head through the opening hullo expecting a stately elizabethan knotgarden or something of that order but it was just a gravelled yard with two white portakabins this noise coming out of one a slow cavernous noise like a giant flute deep underground she stood and listened a while there was an artificial quality to it she padded across the yard the portakabin windows had venetian blinds one was open you could just about see inside she saw two tall speakers computer monitors a tape deck with a green pilot light whole setup looked like a recording studio maybe for making those ambient new age tapes whales talking to one another kind of stuff yes from close behind her ohmygod grayle spun found herself facing one of those people you just knew werent going to be helpful she was about grayles own age goodlooking and so sure of it she could wear an old wax jacket and baggy cords harness her abundant hair in a rubber band what are you doing here authoritative voice very english well bred kind of voice that spurned hugh grant until the last reel i no dont tell me the woman said with a flick of a wrist youre a bloody journalist arent you well uh as it happens yeah but god almighty dont you people ever get the message all visits by journalists interviews etcetera etcetera are absolutely strictly by appointment only so i suggest you go back to your office and attempt to make one i mean would that be so terribly difficult for you listen i dont even know what authority you have to say that no way was she going to identity herself pour it all out to some superior being from the planet arrogant id prefer to hear it from professor falconer i speak for him and you are magda i run this place now look i dont have time for this we have a course next week a dozen people were megabusy so please get back in your car i never heard of you i believe my editor spoke to someone called ersula underhill magda blinked that makes no sense ersulas ancient history the words pushed a cold skewer into grayle who was just imagining ersula in a white labcoat messing with tapes and stuff and taking no shit whatsoever from this woman anyway magda said ersula underhill wasnt authorized to arrange for journalists or anybody else to come here you say shes gone like where grayle noticed that in the portakabin behind her the giant flute had ceased she watched magdas eyes look magda had her hands aggressively on her hips what is this could i please speak with professor falconer no go away well actually a mans voice said and grayle half expecting this turned towards the door of the portakabin he was lean and he wore leather cowboy boots his greying hair pulled back into a ponytail he had an easy smile he carried two small cassette tapes she remembered his face from the front of the videotape package duncan murphy had given her in oxford magda shrugged expressionless and walked away towards the house without giving grayle another glance and which publication do you write for roger falconer said lightly grayle suddenly started feeling nervous as hell the atmosphere had settled around cindy the second he was inside dark little hall smell of damp an acute tang of despair in the chaos its occupant called a study it enclosed marcus bacton like a fog his hair was lank the purplish bags under his eyes blown up by his glasses he looked like a man in need of help but it was never wise to suggest this to anyone always better to turn it the other way round come for your help i have mr bacton marcus bacton grunted better sit down then he tossed two telephone directories from the sofa and about a dozen pieces of paper flew out fuck it he said but he seemed too weary to pick them up the darkhaired young man came into the study he must be over twenty years younger than bacton somehow he looked even less healthy his face was pale and blotched his eyes clouded this made no sense to cindy phenomenologist editorials had been full of references to the wonderful healing ambience i have to say lewis marcus bacton said im totally nonplussed are you actually telling me youve come all this way to talk about this bloody serialkiller nonsense cindy saw the younger man stiffen his eyes still er this is my er nephew maid wilson the young man said bobby wilson how are you bobby yes im afraid i have come to talk about this serial killer nonsense bobby leaned against a wall his arms folded you see marcus bacton said to him bobby didnt look at him what does he mean cindy said bobby sighed he had a letter from one of his readers who suffers from fairies in the greenhouse thats not you is it cindy was furious but contained it no lovely he said thats not me he paused marcus scowled at bobby im the one who wants to know who killed his housekeeper cindy said xxvi cornhaired applecheeked adrian pushed the play button and the big noise wafted out of wallmounted speakers this close it didnt sound so much like a flute as the sound you made when you blew down a seashell or maybe across the open top of a wine bottle adrian and various students spent three weeks inside neolithic underground chambers recording this stuff roger falconer said different times of day different weather conditions quite impressive isnt it what does it mean grayle wondered quite significant actually falconer wore a frayed denim shirt nestling in his greying chest hair was what looked like a flint arrowhead on a leather thong his smile wanted to eat you up it supports the theory that what we know as burial chambers served other purposes perhaps initiatory yes mmm grayle nodded coming on like a journalist as this now seemed acceptable the native americans had something similar right the hopi exactly not so apparent now as it probably was when they were built but the suggestion is that these subterranean cells were constructed as much for auditory as visual effect to provide a sensory experience for the person inside to condition their consciousness adrian said his voice brisk with enthusiasm and private schooling to make them accessible to higher influences yes well said falconer for adrian im afraid its only the beginning oh gosh yes adrian stopped the machine and exchanged cassettes if you listen to this youll hear hold on ill wind back about ten seconds now listen very carefully adrian pushed the button and stood aside from the machine like a stage magician looking at the same time too roughhewn and honest for that line of work ok sure grayle was feeling more relaxed and quite interested after the cool edgy reception from magda the whole atmosphere had changed roger and adrian both upfront friendly charming there adrian said did you hear it huh the portakabin was divided into whitepartitioned sections it looked cool and modern charts on the walls ok ill run it again in fact ill turn it up a little if your ears can stand it you have to realize of course that all this is hugely amplified anyway although weve managed to filter out much of the hiss the hoarse hollow whistling came rushing out of both the speakers like a gathering storm now adrian said there it goes hear it sort of like atchaka atchaka probably a bird said falconer roger it was at night hedgehog then adrian didnt look deflated his face glowed with excitement what do you think it is grayle asked him well i think i believe were listening to a chant possibly the remains of a chant of course its obviously deteriorated over thousands of years falconer smiled indulgently at adrian and shook his head hold on grayle said youre saying this is like a prehistoric voice stone records sound adrian said its infused with magnetism stone records voices and images too and one day im going to prove it roger laughed and clapped him on the shoulder if only you could old chap be enormously illuminating because we really have no idea what kind of language these neolithic people employed you see grayle thats what the university of the earths really all about while im not convinced not by a very long way that theres anything to this evp electronic voice phenomena adrian explained were giving adrian a chance to experiment under scientific conditions and were letting interested members of the public share in that experience which makes for a rather exciting memorable holiday for them and helps fund our continuing research science should never be rarefied or elitist grayle nodded wondering if ersula would agree we do make a bit of a show of the arguments between us adrian admitted it all adds to the fun i mean you know dont put that in your article which paper was it sorry in one ear out the other story of his life said roger the new york courier grayle said hoping to god they wouldnt check cautiously shed called herself grayle turner feeling she just might learn more if she didnt come out as ersulas sister until it was absolutely necessary its uh its a tabloid dont be ashamed of that roger laughed we had an enormously successful season after the people featured us kept asking me how many women had dreams about being seduced by hairy cavemen adrian produced that peculiar english laugh you could only call a chortle we have people sleeping at ancient sites under supervision roger said and recording their dreams adrians convinced that the very nature of the dreams are conditioned by magnetic and radioactive forces and who knows what else and youre not im interested but convinced only by evidence were giving you evidence all the time adrian sounding almost exasperated were bombarding you with evidence my place roger said firmly is on the fence until perhaps we have something really big to announce bobby maiden was startled and on his guard what was this the woman called cindy a woman marcus had apparently never seen before was sitting in the study jingling her bangles and expounding some crazy theory linking together a series of apparently unconnected killings spread over half of southern britain some of them see this cindy said make perfect sense or at least they respond to this persons warped logic a hunt saboteur yes because heor she though i think not supports blood sports a motorcyclist who churns up and pollutes an ancient track yes a warning to the despoilers god preserve us marcus raised his eyes in disgust to the yellowed ceiling but the others well its as if the victim was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time the boy in the doorway the birdwatcher youve seen that one in the papers the man who was battered to death near avebury cindy had brought out a file of notes and maps and press cuttings maiden imagined her arriving at some police station with this stuff the task of getting rid of her being delegated down and down to the most junior dc the dc wondering if there might possibly be something in this that would make his name and his boss saying look son youll get used to people like this be pleasant give her a cup of tea and get her the hell out of here i havent been in person to the birdwatcher site cindy said but id be very surprised if it wasnt just like the others in what way maiden was sitting at the other end of the sofa trying not to show any professional interest marcus was polishing his glasses always a danger sign on a ley cindy said all the murders have been on leys you do know what i mean i suppose remind me my said cindy you cant have spent much time with your uncle leys are straight lines sometimes visible as ancient tracks but mostly not which have been found to connect prehistoric sites and some more modern buildings like churches which were built upon them they appear to mark channels of spiritual energy marcus rammed on his glasses and more recently its been suggested that the original tracks were reserved by our remote ancestors expressly for the passage of the spirits so youre trying to tell us you actually indeed cindy picked up two cuttings which had fallen to the floor and also a kitkat wrapper like she was just itching to tidy this place up you actually believe marcus tipped his chair back against the wall cindys eyes going at once to the dirty scuffmark that someone is killing people on leys deliberately obvious to me it was from the moment i arrived at the spot where maria capaldi died in the manner of william rufus now known to have been a ritual death did you read up on that marcus as i suggested god almighty woman i havent even had the bloody time to think about it weve had a death in case you yes im sorry i was just pointing out that when the kings body was put upon a cart and taken to salisbury his blood was said this is in the account by william of malmesbury to have dripped to the ground the whole way so a line of blood marcus murray in her book points out that this was obviously an impossibility but that it is consistent with the belief that the blood of the divine victim must fall to the ground to fertilize it so how do the others fit into this pattern nobody else was shot with a damned crossbow cindy shrugged perhaps it wasnt appropriate my feeling is that he works intuitively for instance there would to him have been a poetic justice a holistic justice in the gory death of one of the motorcyclists who destroyed the monks trod in midwales decapitated as his machine is rushing along the sacred road spraying out a line of blood in the slipstream the fact that it didnt work out like that equally maiden said it could have been some mindless rural vigilante or a farmer fed up with the noise or an angry rambler cindy tossed him a curious glance you remind me of a friend of mine a certain chief inspector hatch ha marcus said look maiden said carefully the police are not thick but when manpower and money are tight they tend to stick to procedure if theres anything in this idea theyll get around to it after a few more deaths an edge to cindys voice now when hes killed again and again and become careless the problem with the police is they always look for the prosaic solution first thats because ninetynine per cent of crimes are not committed by subtle people a serial murderers mind is never a simple mechanism bobby they are open to strange influences see especially now approaching the millennium psychological profiling is primitive and hopelessly inadequate think how many apparently motiveless murders are later accounted for by the perpetrator hearing voices most of them only remember the voices after theyve been nicked at which stage a psychiatric hospital often seems strangely preferable to the lifers wing never mind all this psychological bollocks marcus said irritably what im totally failing to bloody see is how you can conceivably link this nonsense with the natural certified natural death of the old lady were about to bury maiden shuddered yes cindy leaned back into the sofa cushions and sighed the truth is i cant not yet thats why im here i suppose that any death linked to an ancient site is for me at the moment a suspicious death and when you told me on the telephone well a few things fell together what bloody business is it of yours anyway perhaps i too am hearing voices cindy said sadly and marcus finally lost patience and leapt up from his chair youre bloody mad youve just come here to try and make something out of the tragically natural death of a bloody good woman youre as halfbaked as miss pinder and her bloody ectoplasm youre as unhinged as the old bat from diss with the fairies in the fucking greenhouse marcuss hands clenched excuse me hes had a lot to cope with maiden said as the study door slammed so have you by the look of it lovely still got an eye under there i hope what is it you do bobby painter pictures well theres interesting make a living at it one day maybe otherwise youre between jobs is it on the sick maiden said road accident what do you do cindy when youre not investigating serious crime oh a jobbing thespian i am when i can get the work and an entertainer when i cant comedy and this is all part of your routine is it cindys piercing eyes glittered dont believe any of it do you lovely you think im an old stirrer i just think all youve got is a theory youve no evidence at all you dont seem to have any possibility of getting evidence also theres the problem that ley lines havent been proved to exist ah so you do have some knowledge of these things then were not all thick and prosaic artists cindy said blandly i never thought they were damn well cindy said you may argue that the existence of leys has not been proved to the satisfaction of scientists but i in turn would argue that this is irrelevant all that matters see is that he believes he is killing people on what the maps and his own intuition tell him are lines of earthenergy why oh bobby i could give you a dozen convincing explanations each one dependent on the killers own conception of earthlines and the uses of ancient sites if he believes leys are spiritpaths perhaps he feels he is releasing the spirits of his victims to stimulate the energyflow perhaps he sees them as sacrifices perhaps he feels he is himself absorbing the energy of his victims i just cant hear it in court somehow cindy leaned towards him with a waft of lavender i tell you bobby compared with the rippers who hear voices and charles manson who believed he was in psychic contact with the beatles this person is utterly and coldly rational according to his beliefs more wheels in the yard brought maiden to his feet a coffin passed across the window he recoiled the inside of his mouth felt instantly dry and rough the hearse reversed and threepointturned in the yard under the broken castle walls he was aware of cindy watching his reaction with great interest youre trembling dont like funerals is it who does love them we do in wales you fascinate me bobby you mustve seen any number of corpses in your line of work im not that kind of painter maiden said cindy laughed oh bobby so cautious talk to me lovely you know you want to the hearse waited under the window a man in a black suit got out cindy stood up and moved to the door shall we bring the old lady in for a moment lay the coffin on that oak table in the hall cindy looked back at maiden from the doorway and raised a surprisingly heavy eyebrow maiden flinched i just have dreams since this road accident about what its like to be dead oh after the accident i was dead for over four minutes they brought me back my said cindy thats all it is all thats a very big thing to happen not as big as murder maiden said how could the old girl possibly have been murdered what brought on the stroke cindy said thats what we should be asking maiden thought about black light and said nothing there are more crimes in heaven and earth said cindy than will ever be recorded on police computers xxvii cindys vague sense of unease about the funeral was reflected in the brittle smile of the vicar who greeted marcus with a perfunctory handshake big and redfaced the vicar was the countryparson type you rarely seemed to find any more you imagined him drinking copious amounts of port going off hunting with the nobs this vicar would like it here a nice discreet little church set back from the centre of the village on a small grassy mound possibly prehistoric it had a strong ancient resonance in its rusty pink stone its squat tower glistening in the slow rain you wouldnt prise this vicar out of here any guilty feeling that he really ought to be helping to rehabilitate drug addicts in brixton would be very firmly sat on marcus looked ill at ease in a creased grey suit and a floppy black bow tie and bobby bobby was turned away from the mourners under their umbrellas bobby was gazing up at some sort of gargoyle set into the gable of the church porch there was a sudden heaviness around him he was very still a strange boy two things apparent he was not the nephew of marcus bacton and he was or had been connected with the police cindy who had replaced his red beret with a black one and wore a black suede jacket buttoned over the lambs on his jumper wandered over and followed the boys gaze at once his unease became solid breath piled into his chest so hard he choked sorry pulling a handkerchief from his sleeve oh lord oh heavens chipped and pockmarked he might be but there was no mistaking him old foliageface himself whats that cindy a green man bobby its a green man which is his voice cracked what he isnt anybody in particular simply the green man a symbol often found on ancient churches noone knows what he signifies fertility perhaps quite quite terrifying isnt he why does he bother you i dont know but youve seen him before he breathed out didnt reply in a dream perhaps in one of your dreams he closed his eyes he shook his face was grey he looked as if he might pass out several of the thirty or so mourners had noticed his discomfort the locals the ones with farmerfaces redveined and weathered the mourners began to filter into the church a few likely relatives pausing to speak to marcus the locals avoiding him as you would a cranky old bull go home bobby cindy said gently not your day for a funeral youll only upset people roger falconer had apologized that he had a commitment this afternoon anxious however that grayles article should be a true reflection of his work and his ideas hed invited her to dinner grayle had thought uhoh thanked him but pointed out she had some people to see tonight maybe some other time wise decision probably adrian said seeing her out bit of a ladies man old roger i mean not that you know grayle smiled adrian was just about the most english person shed ever met hed shown her round the centre which essentially was confined to the outbuildings and portakabins shed seen the geiger counters and magnetometers they used to measure radiation and electromagnetism in old stones the infrared cameras and video equipment for capturing anomalous light effects and related phenomena i will admit adrian said that its become rather an obsession with me to show that our socalled primitive ancestors had an instinctive grasp of scientific principles our society is only just starting to reach and to show that compared with neolithic people were hardly alive any more were just not in touch with our surroundings roger understands this very well he just likes to play devils advocate im just glad he agreed to speak to me without an appointment grayle said now thats because he overheard your accent hes very keen on attracting americans to the courses theyre more openminded and they often leave donations as well oh gosh i keep forgetting who im talking to you wont use this will you adrian most american tabloids arent at all like your british tabloids im a you know a very straight person oh right thats all right then sorry to seem you know but hed given her an opening and grayle moved into it though id be lying if i said i wasnt kind of hoping for an american angle when my paper called they spoke to an ersula underhill oh yes i figured maybe we could nose off the piece on her but uh magda said shed gone yes shes gone some weeks ago would you know where maybe i could catch up with her talk about the stuff she did here no im sorry adrian shook his head i dont know really where shes gone she left in rather a hurry i think we all assumed shed gone back home to the states did she say she was going home i mean you know i dont want to cause any trouble like if she was fired or something adrian looked shocked oh no people dont get sacked ersula was just a temporary person anyway she was studying the subject and so it was convenient for all of us its just grayle figured she could go further with adrian than shed have dared to with falconer without arousing suspicions just that ersula underhill was building quite a reputation in the states as an archaeologist and when our guy spoke to her on the phone she seemed so blown away by what was happening here blown away adrian frowned i dont really think she was that type in our debates she tended to take rogers side right grayle took a deep breath maybe it was roger roger that she was blown away with hes a charismatic guy oh now look adrians shoulders went back he looked stern its not going to be that sort of article is it when the people came they were sort of sniffing around you know whether roger was sleeping with his students that sort of thing really not on grayle assured him again that she didnt write that kind of stuff and swiftly spread some balm by telling him about the real nice people shed met at the rollright stones oh theyre awfully good news adrian said earnestly matthew and janny are just the sort of people id like to see more of on the courses committed absolutely got to be committed if theyre even getting married in the stones this weekend in fact are you going i am i think its a really positive thing to do all the times theyve slept in that circle committing their inner selves to the earth thats what a wedding should be a joining of a man and a woman with the earth and that was the moment man woman earth when grayle got the feeling like shed swallowed a whole ice cube adrians face shone with honest fervour she thought these guys have no real idea what theyre messing with its like cindy and his shamanic stuff these stones are magnetic all right they attract airheads and fruitcakes like iron filings well thanks she said youve been real helpful perhaps i will go itd be lovely if you could come if youre still around janny had said we did invite ersula but to the wedding terrific adrian said we could go together yeah well maybe just one thing before i leave here one last attempt to get close to whatever ersulas become any way i can help adrian spread his arms he looked simple and healthy the least complicated of them is there some kind of ancient site locally where i could maybe get a feel for the kind of thing you do oh nothing spectacular nothing like the rollrights theres the knoll of course sort of collapsed cromlech shall i take you no please i already took up too much of your time also id kind of like to take in the atmosphere make some notes if you could just like point me in the right direction perhaps we could have dinner some time adrian said just you know the two of us cindy heard marcus hiss at nobody in particular fucks he doing here a lean man with a greying ponytail peeled himself away from a tweedy clot of locallooking people in the churchyard and clapped marcus on the arm had to come marcus had to pay tribute to a remarkable lady cindy recognized roger falconer respected television archaeologist and the educated mature womans hunk even if he hadnt known who it was he would have realized that this was a tv personality they had a way of projecting themselves from the crowd that was almost mystical they made themselves shine you never even met her marcus clearly thrown off balance to my eternal regret i didnt but there are several people in this village whove testified to her remarkable abilities oh bollocks falconer anybody whos read any of your crappy books knows you dont give a toss for spiritual healing falconer smiled theres a difference i think between spiritual healing and natural healing and mrs willis appears to have had an instinctive gift for plucking cures literally out of the hedgerows my young colleague adrian for instance we were kidding him about his psoriasis saying he couldnt possibly be seen on telly like that and so he came without even telling me to see mrs willis and gone gone in under a week flaked clean away now thats remarkable falconer was speaking loudly in his television voice as if they were filming him he wanted the entire village cindy thought to know what a magnanimous person he was not one to bear a grudge and it sounded not in the least patronizing oh a clever man unlike marcus reddening potent to the end obviously falconers smile opening up two deep grooves in his lean mobile face from the edges of the eyes down to the wide mouth sliced through my fence without much trouble ill pay for it marcus growled backing away i didnt mean that old chap i realize she had a great affinity with black knoll and it was wrong of me high knoll sorry sorry falconer held up his hands in mock defence against a shorter fatter older man with glasses look marcus i know this isnt the best time to go into all this or maybe it is i dont know but things have been said that perhaps both of us regret speak for your bloody self what i want to say falconer squeezed his chin apparently reaching a decision in cutting that fence her last act mrs willis was making a point that im well that im ready to take on board i shouldnt have installed the bloody thing it was a stupid highhanded gesture no ancient monument should be considered private property they belong to all of us anyway its all gone now the fence the wire everything so spading a hand through the air go up there whenever you like if it stands as a kind of shrine to mrs willis a small crowd had gathered marcuss face was plumcoloured now another thing falconer said we may be approaching the same subjects from different angles and were never going to agree fully any more than i agree with young adrian and his cronies but we do have a common cause which is human enlightenment marcus spluttered something that even the good churchgoing folk of st marys would discern as fucking hell i do recognize marcus and adrian certainly does your vast knowledge of the unexplained your passion for the paranormal your perhaps eccentric rural mysticism and so id like to talk just talk about the possibility of your giving the odd lecture to our students at cefnybedd fee negotiable of course marcuss lips moved no words passed between them all right falconer said im not going to push my luck just give it some thought he opened a long hand towards the church door after you chum under a very faint rain grayle picked up the track above what adrian said was the helicopter shed noticing how straight the path was following a direct line into the shelf of low mountains she tried to see it as ersula might have seen it an ancient land a portal to the past could this be a traditional english old straight track connecting a string of prehistoric sites to the ersula she knew that idea would be a turnoff ersula always maintained there was no evidence at all for the existence of ley lines ley lines were graylestuff but all this was before the university of the earth grayle went on following the track to the end of the field she found a stile there hesitated should she the sky was a deep shiny allover grey she was wearing a light sweatshirt jeans and sneakers the blond clumps shoved into a baseball cap the eye of horus earrings in her pocket shed conceived this stupid new age idea of sitting by the old stones closing her eyes and willing ersula to come through to her ersula looking cross you asshole grayle this is the last time i do this right grayle forced a grin climbed over the stile the church was even smaller than it looked from the outside mellow stone quite cosy and easily filled but even so packed it was more than packed people were standing in the aisles in the porch some still outside perhaps in the rain stoical locals in their wellworn funeralwear for an outsider a woman who had been merely employed here and for quite a short time all right a healer but she hadnt healed them all had she mrs willis lay in her coffin on a woodenframed bier pointed at the altar rails this was no outsider cindy sat with marcus on a frontrow pew under dusty red and blue rays from a stained glass window showing jesus praying in the garden of gethsemane it was all quite extraordinarily obvious little annie davies this was and they knew they all knew but why had marcus never said for heavens sake what was going on here cindy scanned the faces and they told him nothing absolutely nothing a shadow of sorrow over some of them but mostly it was the famous british funeral face and it told you nothing cindy stared at the coffin annie davies the unsung visionary of st marys who had returned most discreetly to die who had quietly proved by demonstrating the gift of healing the validity of her experience and who had surrendered her lifeforce at high knoll now a grim and tainted place again he felt a profound sadness now an aching regret that he had not known annie davies while she was alive the things she could have told him when the congregation rose for the first hymn cindy went into the silence and feeling suddenly quite inadequate for the occasion called softly and tentatively from the underside of his mind annie before they left for the church he had found his way to what marcus called the healing room and stood amidst the bottles and jars in order to communicate with the spirit the shaman must find the sanctuary of the essence why was it not here among the remedies in the room where mrs willis had healed and meditated upon her experiences or indeed despite the enormous congregation here in the church for there was no response from within the oaken casket or from the damp steaming atmosphere in the little nave as the congregation began to sing the hymn underpinned by tuneless baritones and frilled by elderly fractured sopranos cindy tried again where are you a sudden sharp breeze made the rain rattle on the stained glass out there no audible tangible or in any way perceptible answer why wont you come in cindy looked at marcus singing quietly and out of tune marcus whose public humiliation had been accomplished with consummate professional skill leaving him looking peevish and curmudgeonly and falconer tolerant and generous the hymn ended the congregation sat cindy spotted falconer across the aisle between two village ladies womens institute types who kept glancing at him with undisguised awe what a vindictive man he must be here he was with his wealth his fame and his academic credibility going to the trouble of attending a small village funeral for it would appear the sole purpose of publicly crushing an elderly nobody who had dared to question his motives in a publication hed probably never previously even heard of ah there was more to it there had to be more to it it was a long life the redfaced vicar said his voice rising and falling as if he was still leading prayers and in the most traditional sense a good life and although most of it was spent away from here although most of us only knew joan when she was already advanced in years im sure i speak for the village when i say and so went the eloquent but mindless eulogy to mrs willis how popular she had been in the village how shed belonged to the wi supported local charitable events was caring towards the sick always cheerful when you met her had quite remarkably continued to work into her ninetieth year ninety she was as old as that well of course she would be and caring towards the sick surely even if her true identity was not revealed the man was going to mention the healing but the vicars high fruity voice intoned not a word to suggest that mrs willis had been any more than an averagely dedicated parishioner he expressed sympathy for her nieces named and for her employer unnamed and suddenly cindy saw the interior of the church as perhaps bobby might have seen it the rosetinted wall hardening to a flinty grey and the members of the congregation rigid as stones a conspiracy of silence the stained glass rattled with rain in his phoney bloated baritone the vicar said and so before we go into the churchyard for the interment we will sing hymn number a shuffling of hymn books but marcus bacton was on his feet ahead of the rest of the congregation oh no marcus cindy hissed marcuss shoulders were shaking with rage his hands gripped the prayerbook shelf until his knuckles blanched and when he spoke it was in a voice rather louder and certainly more resonant than the vicars you hypocritical fuck black knoll jesus an avenue of stones no more than two or three feet high on either side an open passageway curving towards the cavedin chamber there was a fine discreet english rain which very politely soaked you to the skin inside a couple of minutes i could shelter grayle thought i could shelter under the big stone and then she thought are you kidding standing dismayed at the entrance to what had once been a covered passageway the whole thing once concealed inside an earthmound but now bleakly exposed like the abandoned skeleton of a whale she wanted to cry this was it she crossed an ocean for this like she was supposed to believe the stark ruined shell held some kind of key to the transformation of ersula it was nothing it had no grandeur at all maybe it was impressive at sunrise but now on this damp cooling october afternoon under low spongy cloud it was just derelict meaningless she strained to see the green and yellow in the grass the pink in the soil and the little plants growing on the small stones of the passageway the offas dyke path which more or less marks the boundary between england and wales is close i can sense a converging of separate energies energies this place just sapped you was that the path that bare track behind the bushes was this the boundary between waking and dreaming the known and the unknown sanity and madness scary fun grayle was she missing something she tried to picture ersula in her skyblue skijacket making notes on a clipboard lining up a picture with her canon sureshot no sky on it no flowers no people all ersulas pictures were for reference only oh grayle what is the point of piling up pictures of people you see every day for when theyre not there ersula when theyre not there any more a curtain of rain separated her from the big stones she told herself if i go through that fine curtain shell be there shell be waiting for me aw come on she howled aloud youre fucking crazy crazy as cindy the goddamned celtic shaman crazy as adrian fraserhale with his cassette tapes of the number one neolithic rap band like what the hell are you doing here you know where ersula is shes back home with some guy is where you read stuff into her letters that was never there you created a mystery because youre still holy grayle and youre never gonna change she sobbed she looked at her watch it was nearly three pm she would go back to the crappy hotel and she would call up her father and he would say sure shes back in town hell your planes probably passed each other over the atlantic hey never mind grayle at least it pushed you out of that cruddy little tabloid job she stared at the wet grey stones and she sobbed again and soon the air was full of sobs heavy and soggy like the goddamned english clouds she felt weak and walked through the curtain of rain to sit on one of the flat stones she couldnt get any wetter which was when she realized they werent her sobs that she wasnt alone up here this figure was coming towards her off the stones a figure in blue ersula she whispered in spite of herself although she knew it couldnt be and yet she had to know she tried to move forward but it was as if her sneakers were stuck in the red mud ersula she screamed into the rain and then ohmygod the girl was running towards her in a skimpy cotton dress with blue flowers on it the girl had braided hair and she was running hard although the distance between grayle and the stones was no more than a couple of yards so it was as though the girl was running on a treadmill and the stones were some kind of backprojection which was not possible and grayle was disbelieving and confused and then scared more scared than shed ever been in her whole life and she started to hyperventilate a vivid distress vibrating in the grey air the girl was a blur of threshing graceless childlimbs running hard at grayle yet not reaching her never quite reaching her but always coming on in a bumpy flashing pattern like those picture books you flipped through quickly with your thumb and the picture moved only sometimes you flipped several pages at once and the image jerked rushing in tears through the rain in the rain the girl was part of the rain like a rainbow but only dowdy colours the faded blue flowers on the dress the dry mousy brown of the plaited hair and she was flinging out her arms to grayle blown towards her light as the husk of a dead flower her face in flux forming and reforming each time a little closer until grayle could see her sagging flaccid lips and her eyes white and wet and dead oh god grayle whispered oh god xxviii nobody said a word that was the odd thing no murmurings no rustlings no echoes from the rafters the village was letting him have his say nothings changed has it marcus stormed nothings bloody changed in nearly eighty years cindy sat and watched him explode like a series of firecrackers powerless to stop it not sure he ought to try falconer watched too a tiny smile plucking at a corner of his wide professional mouth leaning out of the pew marcus was a wave of grey hair banging against his forehead glasses misted so he couldnt probably even see the vicar who was just standing there lips set into a typically ecclesiastical turningtheothercheek pout he knew what this was about they all knew theyd probably inherited the silence from their parents and grandparents are you all bloody dumb marcus whirled on the congregation is it really possible to sit on something for the best part of a frigging century you really are a bunch of medieval bastards shed have had a better bloody deal growing up in the fucking east end his voice bounced back at him off the stones nobody spoke but cindy saw compassion on the face of amy jenkins an outsider who was clearly in the know hed persuade the truth out of her later i did say the vicar said in the nearest he could manage to an undertone that you might be better advised burying her elsewhere oh yes thats a classic anglican tactic marcus roared if in doubt dont get involved the undertakers moved imperturbably into position around the coffin on its wooden bier youre a very offensive man observed the vicar i can tolerate only so much of this in the house of god before what marcus lunged out of the pew as if he was about to grab the vicar by the surplice and bang his head on the side of his oak pulpit marcus cindy murmured you just stay out of this lewis come on lets get some air youre upsetting mrs willis and that said marcus is the sort of bloody thing you would say as they followed the coffin and the vicar out of the church cindy could almost hear a communal sigh of relief and a closing of frayed curtains over the st marys silence she was soaked hair matted to her face and when bobby maiden found her she was stumbling around the castle walls like someone coming down from a bad acid trip or maybe a mugging maybe even a rape god damn it she said cant anybody around here answer a simple question sorry maiden said youre about a mile and a half out of st marys am i anywhere near uh cefnybedd i say that right thats the university of the earth place uh huh she snatched off her baseball cap and shook her hair like a dog it was blond and it came down in a wet heap i dont know maiden said ive never been terrific youre on a course there visiting i took a walk over she shuddered and it turned into a shiver that looked like it wasnt going to stop see i mustve come down the wrong way i saw the rooftop figured this must be cefnybedd and then is this some kind of castle some kind weird you need a drink i do she said gratefully jesus do i need a drink well thats it isnt it im finished and im not sorry couldnt give a flying fart mrs willis had been buried in virtual silence marcus tossing in his clod of earth and turning away avoiding eyes almost running out of the churchyard cindy had caught up with him in the lane under a dripping horse chestnut like to buy a serious parapsychological quarterly lewis christ you can have the bastard change it to shamanic times have the fucking castle too ill get a council flat they still have council flats or did thatcher flog them all to slum landlords this isnt helping anyone marcus why should i want to help anyone mrs willis helped people and where did that get her perhaps you were right perhaps she was murdered perhaps the village murdered her with threequarters of a century of indifference arent you coming back to the pub what do you think youve paid for the funeral tea that gives you the right to watch them all eating it and feeling uncomfortable i think they owe you an explanation then you dont know the people of st marys and i think you owe me one marcus stopped what why did you keep it to yourself what about annie davies i dont know anything about annie davies did she tell you to keep it quiet she didnt tell me anything we never discussed it piss off go and find your serial killer im tired ok if you must know grayle said its not that kind of shivering maybe finding the guy easy to talk to because he looked kind of like she felt beatup exhausted that eyepatch and with this air of apprehension it was maybe an illusion maybe she needed to feel there were other people around like this after roger and adrian and the mad cindy who were all so sure of everything but she felt the guy didnt trust anybody any more he opened up the woodstove and tried to position a couple of logs not looking at her as she talked like things things you see jesus this doesnt happen in my part of new york we say it does we love to think it does we have a million psychics and people claiming they talk to the spirits see the future read stuff in the tarot purify your aura hearing her own voice going higher and higher as if shed taken a hit from a helium balloon have another drop of marcuss whisky ill make some tea in a minute go on miss underhill g grayle feeling her shoulders shaking like an apartment block about to collapse under the sweatshirt hed left out in the bathroom for her you werent attacked or anything were you i uh grayle took a big swallow of whisky and coughed tears and stuff smeared all over her face i just had to get outa there this is cefnybedd what oh hell no this is this was black knoll the prehistoric whatever you wanna call it what were you doing there his eyes going a mite watchful that place is i mean seriously grayle shuddered a breath down like the dregs of a glass of milk gurgling through a straw haunted right haunted just saying the word it was a whole different word now are you saying you saw something at black knoll would you think i was real crazy would you think like heres this insane american tourist shes only been here like a couple hours and shes already going around seeing another word another key player from the holy grayle thesaurus ghost phantom apparition spook revenant what was it you saw youre gonna think im crazy im not honest ok grayle pushed her hands through her stilldamp hair a girl a young girl in a blue dress with flowers on it like billowed out kind of alice in wonderland she had also she had like pigtails and she was you know majorly upset like she was as scared of me as i or scared of something a frightened ghost jesus how can you have a frightened ghost grayle gulped down the rest of the scotch this is crazy they cant harm you in my column i had this column i was always quoting people who say oh they cant harm you like all aliens are good aliens out of close encounters never independence day i mean how the fuck do they know youre supposed to stand there and like hey this thing cant harm me maybe it needs my help are there people who could do that i dont believe it i listen to all these assholes talk about communion with the spirit world and now i know the truth and the truth is it never happened to them never happened to them or else theyd know it is not nice not good we shouldnt have to see them it is truly terrifying even when you think you understand it is this could send you terminally crazy was this how it started for ersula any wonder she got the hell out oh boy grayle started to shiver again held on to the fat dog with uneven eyes oh jesus no more than two dozen villagers had arrived at the tup for the tea and sandwiches paid for by marcus amy jenkins let them get on with it and joined cindy at his table in the deepest corner its a can of worms love she said fair play if it was happening today i dont think thered be a problem but the church doesnt have that hold any more see a good thing cindy said but also a bad thing so let me get this right the church said well visions of the virgin mary thats a catholic thing so we dont want to know got to remember there was a big chapel influence too all hellfire and damnation and at vision at a pagan place devils work well it destroyed her family isnt it that was the thing annies dad tommy davies he was never much of a churchgoer apparently real old farmer the kind you dont get much nowadays knew everything about the weather and the you know the land moods of the land that sort of thing black knoll was a forbidden place because of the bodies of hanged criminals they used to put there be people then could still remember it but tommy davies he wasnt afraid hed say they put up these stones to help the oldtime farmers so hed take annie up the knoll on the quiet and thats why she was never afraid wouldnt have got any other village girls going up there before sunrise does marcus know about this amy snorted nobodyd tell marcus fair play to him but hed write it all down for his magazine and nobody wanted that cindy bit into a cream cheese and celery volauvent what do you mean it destroyed her family because annies mam edna she was all for the church headmistress of the school ran the womens institute the parish council tells annie shed better forget this nonsense and pray for forgiveness and when she wont drop it out comes the strap have the social services on to her now see but then didnt her dad do anything to stop it edna was the dominant one a cadwallader so it was a long time see before tommy davies did what he did cindy noticed they were getting some attention now a big woman in a hat giving amy daggers dont you go looking at me like that ruthie walters amy said or ill tell him how much owen and ron took falconer for for that land careless talk said the big woman the bloody wars over amy snapped you dont like it tell your edgar to get hisself a slate at the crown ruthie walters scowled amy said owen and ron jenkins are that bastards cousins who used to own black knoll till they found out how badly falconer wanted it thats the sort of dealing goes on in this village like a dog with two dicks owen is where was i you said it was a while before tommy davies did what he did said cindy well amy lowered her voice heve snatched that strap off edna and heve nailed it to the side of the barn if that leather ever comes off its nail tommy says hes going to use the strap on edna till her arse is blue cindy smiled and helped himself to another volauvent well nobody ever spoke to edna cadwallader like that before a headmistress commanded respect see so the strap never came off the nail but edna never spoke to tommy again for the rest of his life the farmhouse was divided into two they say you can still feel the change in the atmosphere to this day when you walk from tommys half into ednas half well well cindy said no need to guess which half mrs williss healing room was in or was it perhaps shed healed the house too and the two halves well that happened in the village as well those who supported tommy and the socalled godfearing half who were on ednas side or didnt dare not to be it was like a feud a silent feud a whats the word schism probly aye family against family hard to credit but this is a tiny little village amy looked up are you trying to threaten me ruthie walters get out of it woman an old man in a flat cap said it was somethin an nothin oh there was a truce amy told cindy and the terms were that the whole thing was forgotten so to this day nobody mentions annie daviess vision werent her fault though the old man said thats why there was such a turnout this afternoon amy said no hard feelings annie now you can say that fred ruthie walters said but whatever powers that old woman had im telling you it wasnt christian course it was christian woman look at lettie pritchards shingles you go an ask her if it wasnt christian to have her shingles took from her her as sung in the church choir for fortyfive year see amy said can of worms no marcus said whatever it is no im going to get pissed in my study and then im going to bed the only person i want to speak to is a bloody decent estate agent and as thats probably a contradiction in terms it doesnt arise maiden blocked his way to the study i just think you should speak to this person big mysteries are involved im sure marcus said sourly her names grayle underhill shes from new york she york new york a bloody american had a bloody american woman on the phone last week insane gabbled that was me mr bacton grayle underhill came out of the study carrying a tumbler with an inch of scotch looking very small inside the borrowed sweatshirt i called you about my sister in the dreaming experiment at black knoll high knoll marcus glared at her is that my fucking whisky when marcus bacton pulled out this leatherbound photo album grayle got cold feet listen say i just say i do recognize her i could be lying how would you know im not lying ill know if youre lying marcus said thirty years of interrogating bastard schoolboys worlds most adroit liar the schoolboy it was nearly six pm going dark early in the lamplight marcuss study was like something out of the wind in the willows flames in the glassfronted woodstove shadows leaping up columns of books and everything misshapen and kind of organic as if the furniture had grown out of the thick walls she took the album onto her knees part of her didnt want to do this ok she opened the album fortunately marcus poured himself more whisky the pictures arent captioned or anything and there are a lot of little kids in there as youll see im kinda scared to look where did you get this said the guy with the eyepatch marcus called maiden mrs williss to be honest i pinched it in case any of the relatives tried to claim it its all we have you see the only picture i cant believe im doing this grayle said all these years of writing about people claiming they saw ghosts i just cant believe i saw did you ever mr bacton sore point maiden said i mean i read hundreds of books interviewed all these psychics and mediums i knew if ever i saw a ghost no way was i gonna be scared because of course a ghost is just a trick of the atmosphere a memory imprint like you see an old movie on tv and its errol flynn and you know hes dead you dont go waaaah thats a dead guy because although i personally cannot imagine how a plastic box can bring a dead guy into my apartment i know there are people who can so thats all right and so i think i think i lost the point am i burbling here am i gabbling turning the stiff card pages peering back down a sepia century past men in wing collars ladies in droopy hats men in baggy pants tied up with string standing under haystacks a lineup of small children both of them watching her marcus with his soft bow tie and his glasses on the end of his nose the comical dog called malcolm watching too through misaligned eyes everything completely still except for her hands turning the pages if you dont find her marcus said it doesnt invalidate your experience if any of this was simple but she could tell his tone was forced marcus was trying to keep emotion out of his voice and grayle was scared to look into the eyes of the children in the album although she knew anyway that the eyes were unlikely to help her on account of none of them would be either wet with tears or flat and dead lights shone in the window car sounds outside maiden stood up probably bloody lewis back marcus said dont let her in and just then grayle turned over a page and her hands sprang back from the album red bmw oh my god its oh christ oh god grayle said underhill marcus leaning urgently towards her oh jesus i cant believe this this is like marcus staring hard at her searching her face for any sign that she was lying xxix below them st marys was a smudge on the bronze evening sky how could he possibly have forgotten about this i cant believe youre living in a place like this the blonde said not having rushed out to embrace him or anything like that or left the car at all hardly looked at him in fact as the red bmw spurted dirt getting them out of the farmyard well i like places like this bobby maiden said quiet lonely places very weird she relaxed checked her speed wouldnt want to get stopped by your little welsh colleagues were still in england not for long always safer to go abroad i tend to think she pulled up at the junction outside the pub im confused now how do i get back on the main road just carry on through the village turn left keep going this is possibly a naive question but whats with the blond wig you dont like it a bit marilyn maybe nah maybe not truth of it is ive been tailed bobby you sure of course im bloody sure who well it didnt have a blue light but bastards pa wouldve gone berserk straight to riggs that would never do so i didnt tell him anyway you start taking this seriously you lose your bloody marbles too late maiden said for you maybe nothing wrong with me sunshine emma curtis drove slowly down into the village gawd you forget there are still places like this that a black cat cigarette sign over the shop this is not my car either by the way hired mate of vics a gem that guy takes an almost paternal interest good maiden said a silence nightfall nuzzled the high hedges on either side em put the headlights on its not good actually is it bobby shows theyre worried not sure which way to jump whats tonys position saying nothing but i suspect in the blackness of his heart of hearts even he wants you popped now popped killed then killed all right absolutely fine you know what i really wish i wish hed retire to spain like any normal businessman hes looking old not well that an option some contingency plan there not for me to say bobby you can say what you like to me love im out of it now or perhaps em said just biding your time until you can come back with enough to screw down riggs and pa in the same coffin and cover yourself with commendations youd like that riggs sure stake through the heart whatever pa retirement dont you think i mean he hasnt done anything really bad what well he hasnt so youll tell the junkies then and the dead junkies parents and the smalltimers who were fitted up to get them out of the picture how they all seriously misjudged father tony of calcutta street em you ever think maybe your old man lies to you a lot she trod on the brakes so hard the bmw stalled and a land rover coming up behind had to swerve into the hedge all right hands flying off the wheel no more change of subject you want us to be ordinary people we can do that cant we one night he saw her face in the headlights of the land rover behind in the silly blonde wig course we can maiden said almost believing it confirmation even the goddamn dress was the same with the print flowers looked faded wornnot blue sepia in the picture obviously but it was the goddamn same dress the hair wasnt in plaits but it looked like the same hair and the eyes the eyes werent dead but they werent laughing either werent laughing even then grayle felt as if shed been attached to some kind of emotional vacuum pump listen she said earnestly strawclutching this could be a delusion like that explanation they have for deja vu like you see something and your mind does this kind of double take so that the first image even though it happened only a fraction of a second ago its become part of your memory and you recall it like it was years ago or maybe in another life yeah looking hopelessly at marcus and cindy the shaman whod kind of filtered into the room soon after maiden left i mean listen im ready to go with that grayle said i dont want you to believe me when im not too sure i believe myself is what im saying marcus and cindy looking at each other without a word hey come on grayle said help me out here guys the eyes of annie davies gazed solemnly out of a photograph over threequarters of a century old in the background was the church of st mary looking not much different from today a slow icy shiver went right up grayles spine a classic shiver just as they were supposed to just like in all the stories marcus said do you know why they had her picture taken with the church in the background for the same reason they sent her there every day for most of a year to pray for forgiveness for her own soul can you imagine that the indignity of it like a juvenile felon checking in with the probation officer for the crime of seeing the virgin mary at a heathen burial place he took off his glasses and wiped his eyes its true enough cindy said just been quizzing them in the pub i have still two sides in that village hard to credit when i was about to leave a very old woman caught hold of my sleeve i know marcus said funny eye thats the one funny eye you know what she said she said you want to ask yourself why it happened on her thirteenth birthday bloody hell people still saying that you know she never went to church again a more christian woman never walked this earth but her holy place was high knoll the child in her the healer in her belongs to high knoll it makes me wonder cindy said wonder what what time did you see this grayle do you remember well i id been to the centre left there maybe around three threethirty i cant say for sure half past three cindy smiled thinly as her coffin was being lowered into the earth what grayle jerked like her chair was wired up youre saying the woman who was buried today was shes gone back marcus said breathlessly might be planted in the churchyard but her spirits up there liberated and even bloody falconers taken down his fence grayle felt like her whole body was made of ice youre saying and shes young again thats the point isnt it oh gee grayle stood up backed off the crazy world of holy grayle was coming alive all around her too much too quickly she couldnt handle this listen im kind of overtired could i get a ride back to the inn wait cindy moved to block the door tall and straight young and free grayle the apparition apparition jesus did she seem young and free to you grayle stared at cindy wanting out of here and fast but marcuss whisky had made her unsteady give it to us unexpurgated cindy said what did you feel when you saw this child grayle held on to the back of her chair the room swam out of focus ok she breathed in breathed out there was no sense of freedom no free spirit deep sorrow real despair marcus looked sick what i saw it she she was like how can i tell you drained like a dried flower like a leaf at the end of the fall you know when all the richness of the colours have gone and theres only the little stem things like the skeleton and it isnt pretty any more im sorry its what i saw im sorry thank you cindy said thank you grayle i dont understand marcus was on his feet looking as unsteady as grayle felt i dont understand what the hell are you saying you should have listened cindy said you never listened to the local people who said the knoll was a dark place the camp welsh accent all but vanished the darkest evil will always gather round the perimeter of a holy place cindy said sometimes someone lets it in the lights were on in abergavenny under half an hour from st marys as they passed through the town then there were long dark hills against the evening sky like oil tankers anchored in a steelgrey bay you must feel in a kind of limbo down here bobby no more here than anywhere big hills mountains the brecon beacons maybe were in all the windows now sponging up what remained of the light you could go abroad nah forget that what about the press not the elham messenger does the news of the world still do that kind of story not got the tits for it maiden said a bilingual sign came up on the left hotelgwesty em ran the bmw into a gravel drive lit by small floodlights in the lawns to either side she parked in a stone courtyard enclosed on three sides by what seemed to be a very old and opulent country house wroughtiron lamps at the entrance golden light spilling from deepsunk windows collen hall em breathed out thank christ its still here would have been a real drag if it had been turned into a home for rural battered wives or something youve stayed here before obviously just the once em said with mr curtis would i do that to you or me come to that no this was with mr and mrs parker actually i was eighteen wed been to my cousins wedding in swansea stopped overnight on the way back to london i remember they had this gorgeous italian waiter both of them had him ill rephrase that an attractive italian waiter was employed here at the time none of us had him pa said he was probably a poof anybody goodlooking pa always says that and thats definitely the last time he gets mentioned tonight if thats all right with you bobby whatever you want you know what i want with a lovely smile em stepped out into the courtyard i wont have it marcus shouted im not fucking having it i dont want your loony speculation i dont want conjecture do you understand me lewis and do you want her spirit to rest or to walk in torment look unease was crawling all over grayle were getting carried away i dont need this this gothic stuff not tonight edging along the wall towards the door would it be ok if i just left it here if you could like tell me the way back to the inn ill walk cindy said youve come all this way my love you mustnt be frightened now for your sisters sake my sister what are you saying i perhaps your sister can help us throw some light on a complex situation complex jesus im sorry grayle youre sorry i want to help you then talk to me for chrissakes dont i rate some answers like who are you apart that is from some weird drag queen who says he has shamanic powers last night i asked you what you were doing here and you were like disinclined to tell me and now drag queen marcus roared fucking drag queen shamanic tradition cindy said weakly this bitch is a man you didnt know i thought you knew each other marcus sank back into the sofa reached for the scotch cindy said to grayle i told you half of it i told you there were two sides to that place high knoll and black knoll marcus poured an inch of whisky you mean youve got bloody balls under there we discussed how the image of the rotting man in your sisters dream might have been the placememory of some druidic human sacrifice marcus sat up whats this show him the letter cindy said take his mind off having a deviant in his house carved oak panelling deepset window sills on the wall beside the slanting wooden stairs lanterns of black wrought iron held electric candles expensive enough to fool you at first very romantic and four stars you wouldnt find many of those in wales em said over dinner she was in a plain white frock a gold locket around her neck minimal makeup no perfume blond wig gone dark hair down she shimmered took away his breath and most of his appetite this was better this was close to real life fiddling with a cooling spanish omelette he realized he knew almost nothing about her what happened to her marriage did she have children a job a criminal record to what extent was she still dependent on the person they werent mentioning and on that persons business ventures em frowned for a moment not at all not since i got out of university not since i found out what he was into before that even i mean actually that wasnt too long ago it really never occurs to you that your kind generous loving parent might be a businessman no maiden said i suppose it wouldnt if like tony youve been lucky and never had to go away for long holidays anyway she said over the years ive been holding out her right hand counting off on the fingers an estate agent a receptionist in a hotel in devon even posher than this one a bitpart actor with walkons in inspector morse and a couple of soaps i absolutely refuse to name which is where the lovely suzanne came from something like that then i was an english language teacher in the dordogne a partner in a small publishing house which we conveniently flogged to a big publishing house oh and she grinned and a prostitute in bayswater and i have to guess which of those isnt true right maiden said estate agent you couldnt have sunk that low oh bobby youre feeling better arent you how are you feeling im feeling all right guvnor im feeling optimistic have some wine i dont need it because he was already high riggs was in another hemisphere cindy and the leyline serialkiller fantasy and the american girl who saw a ghost that was in a parallel universe above their table was another of those electric candlelanterns with a glowworm tip which flickered glancing at the tiny pulsing filament he caught an image of a bluewhite streetlamp fizzling out and blinking on again another woman thered been another woman in old church street that night under a faulty streetlamp he couldnt remember anything about her except that she hadnt been suzanne bobby sorry he smiled uncertainly something came back to me in connection with what that night before you came round the corner in cluttons car she sighed did you see a woman across the road under a streetlamp only you bobby strolling casually up the street if thered been a tin can youd have been kicking it and whistling what were you thinking about you balls are we sending for the sweet trolley i dont think i want the sweet trolley em said do you marcus placed ersulas letter beside him on the sofa look she came to see me came here to the house with a briefcase a personal organizer a pocket tape recorder thats her grayle felt tearful on top of it all she felt tearful get a hold marcus said i found her to be honest rather pushy as though she had a right to whatever information i could give her you began to feel like a sucked lemon after a while though you had to admire her persistence grayle said did you try to discourage her from sleeping at high knoll no why should i if it could bring out the healer in a naive thirteenyearold girl it couldnt be the evil heathen place of local superstition and ecclesiastical prejudice could it and it she was clearly doing it for her own research nothing to do with falconers crowdpulling schemes did you see her again after she spent a night there no i did ask her to let me know what happened but well she was looking for a scientific explanation of annies vision electromagnetism in the stone lowlevel radiation anything which might have stimulated the brain into hallucination mode or whatever she called it i presumed she hadnt had any quantifiable results she didnt strike you as kind of you know unbalanced absolutely not girl was a human database did she say how she might follow through with all of this any other place she might have been planning to visit while she was here she seemed to be focused entirely on high knoll the vision of the virgin all that the unknowable cindy said the ineffable light such things happen lovelies they do ersula was drawn to that grayle said the whole virgingoddess thing ersula has always been a feminist right from about age two two sides cindy said the ineffable light and the unutterable evil the question we should be asking is what or who has tipped the balance towards the latter the black light marcus said bleakly indeed only mentioned it a few days before she died if i thought of it i suppose i regarded it as subjective psychological a reflection of the state of her health well dear cindy stood up easing his feet out of the sensible walking shoes gliding to the window and looking out into the nothingness of the night perhaps it was if she was drawing energy inspiration call it what you will from the knoll and the energy there had been negated then shed be like a diver whose air pipe was blocked marcus said and if the night she died she went back there determined to unblock marcus poured himself some whisky and drank it and now shes dead and frozen out just as she was for most of her life betrayed stuck in some sepia limbo i cant bear it suzanne would not have worn it suzannes would have been short and black possibly shiny this nightgown said as explicitly as you could get no more suzanne she stood in the bathroom doorway the light behind her no lights on in the bedroom where maiden sat still fully dressed on the edge of the fourposter bed out of place in a house this old the fourposter was patently fake with posts of antique pine and dusky pinkfrilled curtains a bottle of house champagne with a big red bow unopened on one of the bedside tables a quaint medieval sign warning do not disturb hanging undisturbed from the door handle inside the room naff trappings of the honeymoon suite but nothing naff about em curtis her hair was covering her shoulders hiding the tops of her breasts her nightgown of magnolia silk long enough to cover her feet had long wide sleeves ending in little ropes he stood up he was shaking she glided like some tudor ghost down the two thickly carpeted steps from the bathroom and halfway into his arms im not questioning it maiden said hoarsely i died im entitled to go to heaven a finger on his lips not another word bobby close your eyes bringing her lips close to his but not quite touching except with her soft winebreath presently he felt slender ringless hands moving under his sweatshirt skimming his skin life after death there was life after death xxx a scarred moon hung diffidently outside the stonesunk mullioned window of room five a moon which had seen too much of this and didnt want to get involved but its ok em said really maiden felt his hand would leave a filthy smut on her skin and he took it away she pulled it back dont i dont know what to do maiden said hey she said i was half expecting it you want the truth christ when i think of all the things that happened to you knocked down beaten up its a wonder you interweaving her fingers with his anyway its ok it really is ok bobby all right i dont think he didnt want to talk about it all the words were like cardboard cutouts i dont think you understand come on guvnor dont say it never happened before there isnt a bloke alive it never happened to certainly not someone as messed up and threatened and bobby relax im sorry and look were here im happy believe it when you went away ask vic vic knows i wasnt functioning ive thought about this a lot i mean i didnt want to get this wrong because ive got enough things wrong in my life listen let me tell you emma whatever else you got wrong was as and i kept on asking myself could it have been the excitement of it because it was exciting all that suzanne stuff you create a fantasy and you want it to go on i wanted to tidy up your flat put your pictures on the walls christ they were so lonely those pictures so you see i wanted to be sure it wasnt the romance of all that romance you dont see it do you sorry the loner the misfit dark goodlooking trapped in a world where he doesnt belong oh god yes and now an eyepatch clutching his hand to her breast the breast surely felt warm and wonderful it was the hand that felt like dead meat were all mills and boonies at heart she said thats why so many women get murdered maiden said didnt you know fascination with the lone moody psycho crimeprevention hint number thank you inspector no more inspector thats all over i wonder if it is hey listen i think i want to meet your dad i want to meet norman plod christ ive been thinking about him a lot i reckon hes probably got a secret something like the paintings only different something he had to hide hes your old man after all he cant be totally insensitive no all down to genetics youre wrong hes profoundly insensitive if he was here now hed be sneering i will never sneer you know that dont you oh god look maiden said wanting to cry piss off out of this while you can please no chance em said softly no chance i thought it was going to be all right i was convinced tonight but its not going to be all right i really want you to just just be out of it because youre full of shit bobby you dont know how much we can get rid of it he said nothing his lips felt dry and cracked he was cold and without sensation he thought hed never felt as much hatred and contempt for anybody as he did for himself tonight you want to sleep no i mean no no i dont want to sleep its just when i talked to your friend the sister she said head damage you need a lot of extra sleep to get over it what else did she tell you not much its a patientnurse thing i expect how about i make some tea dont go he held her hard against the full length of his body his body but tragically not all of it had gone rigid at the thought of what would happen if sleep swallowed him all right i wont she sounded just a little scared i wont go oh god em i what he rolled onto her inside what was left of his head buried between her breasts he begged for help silently screaming into the cold void what were you going to say nothing really say it its very much the wrong time no its the right time therell never be a better time please bobby im thirtythree im getting too cynical say it to me he closed his eyes on her and something altered something altered he imagined her body damp and cold under him like clay her arms around him knobbly like roots her breath turned brackish and that oh no oh please no was when he became suddenly and sickeningly erect she said not moving at all as if she hadnt noticed i love you bobby no almost exploding with selfhatred he rolled out of bed and crawled away in his shame what are you trying to say what are you walking all around on tippy toes trying god damn it to say we dont know what we are trying to say cindy said we are both of us in the dark and when it comes down to any form of remedial action i am afraid powerless grayle said youre trying to say my sister is dead of course not marcus said gruffly or maybe shes insane right grayle shrilled she got taken over by the goddamned dark forces of the stones now see what youve bloody done marcus said to cindy see maybe grayle standing at the door waving her arms maybe the ancient evil of the stones possesses everyone who sleeps there right and theyre cursed for ever and when they die their spirits hover around the stones and roam the dark hills and its all its all stephen king oh you guys you sure dont help a person just had their first psychic experience do i need this do i need an evening with the goddamned brothers grimm she started to cry ill drive you back to the pub cindy said thanks grayle snuffled in the grounds there was a wooden bench by a stone wellhead capped now so that you couldnt see down below a couple of feet bobby maiden sat on the bench beside the well his leaden head in his damp handsbarechested barefoot all hed grabbed were his jeans he lifted his head looked up with his uncovered eye at the shambling facade of collen hall mostly dark now except for a small peachy light a bedside table light in a firstfloor mullioned window room five as he watched the light went out no so tell her go back and tell her tell her about the dreams of death the body your own body rotting around you tell her about the fear of sleep tell her everything tell her what shed be taking on yes inside the clanky old car grayle apologized good heavens child cindy said i think you were rather restrained under the circumstances all too much all at once plus with all our preconceptions of england everybody staid and reserved and bowler hats and stuff underneath it all my love we are a horribly weird nation the old car chugged under the castle walls but im gonna find her grayle tried to settle in the torn and lumpy situpandbeg passenger seat i mean it i wont leave until i find her leave st marys this country shes somewhere in this country see im going to this wedding tomorrow therell be people there who know her maybe even jesus maybe shell be there its possible you are a determined girl dont patronize me shit im sorry there i go again no i am sorry you must think were all batty me with my shamanic fantasies my obsessions getting old is what it is grayle getting old and getting nowhere an old queen in search of a stable throne and me with my ghost fantasy fantasy now is it i couldnt begin to say is it all in the mind the brain pulling some scam is that what you feel no i feel i feel it really happened in that case it really happened you were a witness to the failure of the spirit of annie davies to return to the level from which she might go on its quite true what they say a traumatic death an unfinishing a snatching away causes a blip the term earthbound she shes out there she is out there thats scary and real sad terribly sad grayle cindy pulled in under the sign of the rams head get a good nights sleep enjoy your wedding regardless and afterwards perhaps dont come back marcus will look out for ersula leave your telephone number and your address with amy well keep you fully informed get on with your life grayle put a foot out to the kerbside arent you coming in im going back i need to talk to marcus while bobbys out some things i havent been told this is no night for secrets just in time sir the night porters keys swinging from a thumb about to lock up i was sorry maiden said left something in the car should keep them in your wallet sir the night porter eyed his bare feet gravel between the toes and winked right maiden shuffled a smile very good sir good night good night bobby maiden set off up the stairs the thought of warm firm em in the bed set off the old stirring but that was how it had been before it meant nothing all the artificial candlelanterns had been switched off except for one at the top of the stairs into his thoughts fluttered the image of a woman standing under it like the woman standing under the streetlamp before he died he shook his head opened the fire door to the first landing perhaps shed locked him out liz now liz his wife would have locked the door attached the security chain and thrown all his clothes out of the window everything except possibly the car keys stood for a moment outside the door of room five the honeymoon suite the light was out ran fingers down the jamb the door was half an inch ajar and a wave of something broke over him and it was something more than gratitude and he knew that emma curtis wasnt going to be asleep felt her grin through the darkness life gets complicated dont it maiden padded into the room you didnt give in you didnt ever bloody well give in you came back whatever you left behind you had to get that back too you didnt let the grave win you turned a deaf ear to the cold calling in the end love wins love wins in the darkness he kicked away his jeans a wafer of moonlight lit ems hair on the pillow as he slid between the posts and into the bed all right this is a bed it isnt a tomb the mattress is soft the four posts are not stones the carpet is not earth the smell is in your head ignore it you can love her you can do it he slipped a hand under the nightdress around a breast slid it down over a thigh where she was wet em can i talk to you she didnt reply em where she was too wet and cold he leapt out of bed and across the room and slapped on all the lights smears on the switch as the lights came on and on his hands dark winered on his chest his arms a trail of blotchy footprints from the bed to the switch the bed itself like a waterbed which had burst dark water xxxi the morris minor took a bend on what felt like two wheels cindy grinding the arthritic gearbox to get out onto the main road ahead of a container lorry marcus closed his eyes do you want to kill us both lewis cindy said do you want to tell me the truth about our friend bobby as cindy was coming through the door the phone had rung and marcus had said maiden maiden is that you a couple of times before shaking his head and handing over to cindy cant make make out what the hell hes saying and cindy had listened gravely for a long time to a man sounding like someone teetering on the very edge of the abyss asked bobby precisely where he was which sounded from his garbled description like glangrwynne between abergavenny and crickhowell there was a bridge there over the river and cindy had very calmly told bobby to wait there by the pub and they would come and pick him up all right marcus said resigned as they crossed the welsh border names maiden police detective got knocked down by a car in elham died in hospital dragged back into the picture by a friend of mine anderson nursing sister friend and ah spiritual healer initiated as it were by mrs willis really at the knoll marcus said reluctantly anderson says she used the holy light to raise the boys ah dormant spirit they had one of those crash things going on maidens chest anderson threw the light into him at the same time fusion of science and the holy spirit also the shamanic art of soulretrieval where the shaman takes a trip to yes yes marcus how experienced is she shes a nurse i didnt mean professionally could she have let something else in i dont know how would i know that see what we have here is a young man left with a terrible fear of death and prey to images which leave him and me feeling extremely cold fair play to the boy hes only a copper not going to give us a dissertation on sitespecific negative atmosphere is he but hes sensitive hes been telling us pure and simple what he feels been telling people ever since id guess first time i met him marcus said was at the knoll as mrs willis lay dying kept urging us to take her down from the stone i asked him why said he didnt know why well of course he didnt had a very negative death experience not wonderful for everyone as you know the nice ones are the only ones people like to talk about feeling the others tend to reflect badly on what kind of life they must have led thus far hieronymus bosch demons clinging to their toes examined it in the phenomenologist couple of years ago several biddies complained no wonder he was in a state hed never been to the knoll in his life before but some part of him knew the place intimately and it was a place without happy memories you could be right marcus said grudgingly had a head injury perceptions dulled ever since plus whatever he encountered during the minutes of his death was so traumatizing that hes blocking it his subconscious erected a barrier made even more dense as you say by the effects of the head injury which is also filtering ordinary everyday sensory input to his brain his whole experience of life is diminished like looking down a telescope from the wrong end he feels hes in a murky dream desperate to wake up he behaves erratically there was a short silence apart from the choking noises emitted by the car erratically marcus said warily cindy sighed perhaps our friend grayles outburst was closer to the truth than she imagined the virus in the stone seems to inflame dark emotions i should tell you yes perhaps you could tell me why were picking them up not them hes alone i wish i had known what he was doing what he was proposing for tonight merely proposing to get his end away far as i could see because the situation i am afraid is that bobby seems to think he may have murdered the girl in this dismal room in the rams head even in the dark grayle was finding it hard to relax drift off too much had happened all of it scary and the worst thing kept rearing ersula dead shed never let herself even contemplate it outside the window in a village out of time the wooden pub sign creaked on its pole grayle rolled over on the mattress which was surely no more comfortable than the top of some frigging burial chamber you never like to think of yourself as a religious person spiritual maybe sensitive sure but religion in the end is what it came down to im religous i need something to lean on i come over here to lose holy grayle and who do i find but holy fucking grayle she realized she was lying here in the dark mentally cutting up fragments of ersulas letter and fabricating that long conversation shed been planning to have with her when they met up here in england this made her feel even more lonely believe it grayle i told you i do believe it im a halfass gullible new age goofball i i mean take it seriously for the sake of all thats holy ersula throwing back the hood of her dark parka and putting her face right up to grayles her eyes burning with urgency jesus grayles whole body lurched she blinked in terror the inn sign crashed back in a gust of nightwind all thats holy ersulas voice echoing in the room ersula who didnt believe in holy who didnt believe in ghosts who hadnt written in her letter half of the stuff grayle just heard her say eyes stretched wide grayle gathered the sheets and the eiderdown around her and shivered herself into dreamsodden sleep they found him as arranged a few miles north of abergavenny where the road narrowed into a clutter of white and stone cottages and a pub that was closed he came shambling up from the darkness of the riverbank head bowed unsteady looking like a man whod been dragged by muggers into some alleyway and had the stuffing kicked out of him all right cindy throwing open the passenger door get in the back marcus bobby and i have to talk cindy plucked at a sleeve of bobbys jacket as he got in then inspected his fingers blood bobby did not respond he sat silently wrists crossed over his knees as though they were already in handcuffs he looked like a man who could imagine no future cindy flung the morris into gear accelerated away in first marcus howling that he was going the wrong way should have turned round on the pub forecourt scene of the crime cindy said softly i would like to see the scene of the crime bobbys shoulders jerked at this but he said nothing the old car made it to fifty mph with a horrible metallic shriek two minutes later cindy slowed at a sign which said hotelgwesty this the place is it lovely look bobbys voice parched as a ditch in august im sorry about this i panicked shouldve driven the bmw to the police station in abergavenny if you go back that way you could drop me outside marcus leaned over from the back seat makes sense lewis cindy stopped the car just inside the hotel gates but didnt switch off the engine which juddered shaking the whole car he reached up to turn on the feeble interior light that way neither of you are involved bobby said pale as death ill just tell them i thumbed a lift into town drop me at the station drive away no risk of anyone all of life cindy lowered the handbrake and the car lumbered a little further up the drive is one delectable risk after another an old house came into view more stately less rambling than say cefnybedd security floodlights shot emerald rays across the bowlinggreen lawns you realize marcus said that if this engine cuts out as it seems in imminent danger of doing youll never get it going again and then well all be sixteenth century at least cindy mused probably older possibly much older look if you want to come on like nicholas bloody pevsner lets make it some other time shall we just turn this heap of scrap round and get your dainty little fucking foot down the front door of the hotel opened a man peered out towards them shading his eyes against the floodlights night porter bobby said hell get your number in that case i hope you paid your bill lovely cindy put on the headlights full beam and you could see that the night porters jacket was green and marcus grabbed cindys shoulder from behind are you completely bloody mad abergavenny police station bobby said ten minutes so that you can confess to murder because see i really think you ought to confess to me first im your fairy godmother talk to me lovely go cindy turn the engine off then i will if you want time to think about it cindy leaned back and reached for the keys at your fucking peril marcus snarled the night porter was strolling across the grass towards them did i kill her you want to know all the time in the world lovely the night porter took what appeared to be a notepad from his top pocket no bobby said for what its worth worth the earth it is cindy cut the headlights slammed into gear let out the clutch with a bang and reversed her in a long orgasmic scream bobby breaking down into dry sobs poor dab xxxii theyd walked up by the light of the stars and the cold cynical moon cindy up front carrying the canvas suitcase followed by marcus in an old naval duffel coat with a hikers backback and malcolm on a lead and bobby maiden wearing a lumpy old tweed jacket of marcuss over a white tshirt and sweatpants cindy bent to set down the candlelantern at the end of the big stone and the light shone out as if from the prow of some fossilized sailing ship maiden was unsure why they were here he remembered going back to castle farm marcus throwing logs on the stove cindy giving him some herbal drink to calm him he did feel calmer calmer than hed any right to feel why cindy straightened up face gaunt and hollowed like eroded stone in the lonely light and there was something about cindy maiden couldnt fathom to sleep bobby and perchance as i was never considered suitable to confide to an audience in even the meanest repertory outfit perchance to dream you that is not us all right what was in the drink he didnt remember changing he didnt know what had happened to his bloodied clothes but it was ems blood and he wanted them back to be stained with ems blood for ever she thought it was me she must have died thinking it was me what was in the drink nothing a doctor wouldnt prescribe and with fewer sideeffects relax bobby you wont be seeing pink tigers right then children cindy pulled from his case some kind of plastic sheet lets examine our situation cindy and marcus laid the sheet on the grass and weighed it down with a couple of small stones and the suitcase cindy made them sit down their backs to one of the huge supporting stones of the burial chamber which looked bigger at night and less like a ruin maiden remembered grayle underhill and her ghost and that seemed a very long time ago been talking about you we have bobby cindy gazed beyond the small circle of light on the basis that you know more than you have been able to tell us more than you know you know if i am making myself clear maiden hadnt realized until he sat down how tired he was his head nodded although he knew there was some reason he shouldnt sleep bobby cindys hands clapping his face not yet lovely listen listen to me were going to take a leaf out of professor falconers book bastard borrowed the bloody book anyway marcus said sister anderson told you did she not how she brought into play the light of high knoll in the moments before your heart was restarted yes we believe that you were exposed in those moments to what we might call the night side of these stones and something lodged in what to avoid a more contentious word i will call your subconscious mind what i want to do now is take you back using the dream techniques employed by the professor and his people are you familiar maiden shook his head cindy explained simply whatever maiden said long past caring whatever cindy nodded stood up grabbed the suitcase from the plastic sheet and strode off into the darkness after a while malcolm howled suddenly once his wedgeshaped head inclined to the starry sky marcus patted him settle down old son hes just a bloody old ham wheres he gone maiden wondered fuck knows behind them the chamber was a primeval altar on fat legs it had cracks and fissures filled with black shadow now where the wan candlelight could not penetrate maiden put out a hand and touched the stone for the first time and recoiled it really wasnt that cold as though blood was pumping through it maiden you sorry marcus you couldnt have hallucinated the whole thing could you i mean this woman this butchery due to brain damage and lack of sleep and shes really still alive marcus said nothing and the blood sorry marcus rubbed his eyes never had anything to do with anything like this before who do you think it was a kind of accident marcus it was supposed to be me in the blackness of his heart of hearts even he wants you popped now killed then killed all right not this bentcopper nonsense right maiden said the bentcopper nonsense some contractpsycho maybe the same inept outoftown hardmen he and vic encounted in the flat in which case theyd better be well out of town when the news got back to tony parker one way or another they were going down all the way down thered be another bloodbath and riggs the trail of blood would make a big circle all around mr riggs and hed stand there in the centre perfectly still and perfectly dry as ever into the circle of light came the bird of prey bloody hell marcus said been consulting my guides i have it hung over maiden wings spread wide dear god marcus said cynically it was a fulllength cloak made of some rough material like sacking with rows of feathers sprouting out of it cindy also carried a drum and a large bird made of some black and red fabric with a curved beak and big globular spiteful eyes offthepeg shamanicwear marcus explained to maiden with heavy ennui the feathers are especially meaningful for lewis kites his totemcreature once wrote a piece for the phenomenologist about spending three days and nights fasting in the cambrian mountains and on the last night the great red kite flew down in a dream the red kite at the time being almost extinct in britain and more or less confined to that particular part of midwales what a memory you have marcus kelvyn kite maiden awakening to an old fogged memory thats kelvyn kite marcus looked up but the bird said nothing kelvyn kite this big talking hawk on telly when i was a kid you must be older than you look bobby cindy said sitting down arranging the cloak a single hollow drumbeat this place is a special place the lights down there are the little lights of england the darkness behind us is the darkness of wales above us heaven below us earth duality the black mountains a sacred frontier cindy paused four leys cross here from stone to tumulus to holy hill and ancient church lines of spirit soulpaths maiden saw that cindy was holding the flat drum between his knees looked so much bigger in the cloak of feathers and yet less substantial shimmering in the unsteady light but then nothing seemed entirely solid seen through a single eye blurred with tears drugs fatigue and behind me the stones themselves set to the midsummer sunrise stones of light on the drum cindys hands had found a slow rhythm regular as a hall clock ticking and maiden became aware of his heart beating in time to the drum and stones of darkness because when times grew harsh and the land itself darkened into war and strife the religion of the celtic priesthood the druids degenerated into blood ritual animal sacrifice human sacrifice and the shaman no longer waited in the chamber for the blessing of the sunrise but stood with sickle raised under the full moon and blood gushed over the capstone and trickled in rivulets down the fissures in the stone and so to the earth maiden flinched the drumbeats speeded up he thought of the thrumming of blood through veins oh em oh god im sorry im sorry you ever had to know me and so the knoll became a place of fear and death cindys voice matching the riseandfall rhythm acquiring the timbre of a chapel preacher high knoll in effect became black knoll bang on the drum high knoll bang black knoll bang duality bangbangbang think on it children think on it as we call upon the guardian of this site to yield to us the images lodged in the soul of our friend bobby ready are we bobby whats going to happen token question he didnt give a shit we take you back cindy said to the minutes of your death and you leave me there no need to bring me out of it xxxiii were mad marcus thought still amazed at himself for going along with this bollocks mad standing here like relatives around a bloody deathbed insane or will be by morning supposed it was the remains of the bloody teacher in him but he liked a certain level of order liked his anarchy to be structured which was what the phenomenologist was supposed to be all about bunch of tweedy old academics and retired surgeons and vicars and bank managers whose hero was the immortal charles fort collector of yarns about black rain and toads that fell from the sky all right itd been taken over by the biddies now but it was still respectable people breaking out of their social straitjackets daring to consider the absurd to consider not to be bloody part of it for christs sake maiden lay on the foamrubber mattress from marcuss backpack the capstone a little above chest height to marcus was on a slight incline so that maidens head was higher than his feet there was a small cushion under his head and they covered him with a travelling rug all right there lovely fine he said dully poor bugger was half out of it staked out on the tomb like an offering lewis blatantly exposing him to the dark side of the knoll maiden too low too beaten down to care and was he a killer was he lying to them to himself was he a killer and where the hell was this nonsense going to get them falconers dreaming experiment was designed to find out if human consciousness was affected in any quantifiable fashion by the location and composition of ancient sacred monuments whereas lewis seemed to think maidens dreams could solve everything lewis ought to take over the damned magazine get on well with the biddies the first candle had burned threequarters down and cindy the bloody shaman in his ritual cloak blew it out and marcus heard him ramming another one down the lantern well watch him in ninetyminute shifts all right you know what you are doing marcus every few minutes i check his eyes for rem and then you give him a few minutes more no more than three because the action in a dream happens very quickly then i wake him up poor sod very gently you want him talking about the dream almost before he is out of it he may fall asleep again and awake with no memory of having spoken to you we have to be able to play his dream back to him make him face up to it how is the recorder you have to shake it hope the bloody light comes on havent used it in years hardly needs to be broadcast quality marcus switch on just before you wake him can you hear me bobby very tired you are yes now i want you to empty your mind i dont want you lying there thinking about what happened tonight just make yourself quiet inside watch the sky lewis lit the new candle another two hours it would be dawn the miraculous dawn at high knoll marcus was freezing wished he had a bloody cloak of feathers during lewiss shift hed managed to doze intermittently for about two minutes at a time before the cold razored through his duffel coat he realized malcolm had moved away leaving another large cold patch aware of the dog standing a few yards away growling uncertainly and the voice of cindy the bloody shaman perhaps you could assist me marcus opening his eyes fully to see lewis leaning over the stone like some victorian granite angel over a grave s wrong marcus stumbled to his feet and approached the stones the lantern showed the sleeping maidens visible eyelid behaving like a moth trapped in a jar oh that all during his own shift marcus had spent too long leaning over the capstone persuading maiden to spill some irrelevant nonsense about a woman under a streetlamp while lewis sat on the groundsheet legs folded under him meditating or whatever they did not even coming out of it when maiden had begun to weep marcus feeling obliged to take off his eyepatch to let the tears out endless bloody tears crying himself back to sleep poor bastard marcus fighting tears too because all the worst nights of his life had involved females dying celia in hospital sally at home mrs willis here at the knoll his adult life a series of bridges over rivers of death no thats not quite all marcus thing is a little resistant he is now to awakening you cant wake him well thats all we bloody need isnt it and your cassette recorder is malfunctioning the recorder lay on the capstone marcus snatched it up and hit it with the side of his hand the red light wavered on then went out maidens face had that frozen effigy look still in rem and thank christ for that because if his unpatched eye wasnt moving you could think he was dont like the look of him come on man snap out of it softly bugger softly mans got bloody brain damage could be that stuff you filched out of the healing room i did warn you bobby lewis shook maidens shoulder the rug over him moved and lewis pulled back holding the candle high when one of maidens arms came out as if he was going to grab it bobby can you hear me maidens hand went instead to his throat dragging the rug away his head started rolling from side to side he began to cough come on now bobby a dry rasping cough his head still rolling until it dislodged the cushion which fell off the capstone and then his head was rolling on the bloody stone you could hear it and it must be hurting and even that didnt bring him out of it dont think i like this lewis to put it mildly chest heaved weakly and the cough softened into a kind of hoarse breathing as though there was something he wanted to bring up but he was too weak what if he bloody dies again yes again except lewis that this time therell be no whitecoats no crash team no oxygen mask no scottish nurse with healing hands only a silly old sod who should know better and a lunatic in a birdsuit with a lot of bloody explaining to do maiden wake the fuck up marcus pulled the rug away maidens chest was throbbing weakly like a sparrows when its been hit by a car and you know its only seconds away from expiring oh the madman lewis said oh dear oh fucking dear indeed he wanted to go to the police station he begged you to take him to the fucking police station but you had to be clever because the police fair play to them would have been no help at all because if that girl is dead theyll never know why and you will i do marcus i want bobby to know its important bobby knows its more important he bloody lives maiden was making a sort of whooping noise in the back of his throat as though there was some ghastly blockage there he gagged his fingers clenched back arched whole body tightened up clenched went rigid his face convulsed in the lanternlight swimming in sweat and tears dead silence a moment of heightened reality the reality in fact was almost searing marcus holding the lantern now was aware of all these delicate mosses and lichens and tiny plants stubbling the stone one of those crystal moments when you realized you were at the heart of a nightmare and you kicked a hole in the dreammembrane and woke up covered in sweat and trembling with relief and went downstairs and made coffee he heard himself say i hope your famous shamanic training included the basics of first aid because i think this poor bastards run out of air to breathe all right lewis throwing off his stupid bloody feathery cloak dragging himself up onto the capstone extending a hand to pull marcus after him help me turn him over marcus snapped on his side both hands underneath maidens back heaving him over so that one arm was flung out over the edge of the capstone marcus no sit him up thats it marcus pulling maidens body forward taking the weight and lewis bunching a fist and striking maiden sharply in the small of the back again and again and marcus was utterly furious you bloody bastard lewis you knew something like this would happen didnt you didnt you i thought it might be rather unpleasant and you might make me stop it before it was over and oh dear oh dear take the light marcus hold the blasted light look maidens body twitched violently a spasm and the dog let out a terrified yelp eyes glowing at the foot of the burial chamber something falling out of maidens mouth pink and grey in the candlelight coming out in lumps marcus dont dont touch it marcus froze on the horizon a thin grey bar appeared where the night was lifting like a roller blind part three the nasty cruelties of slaying cock robin with an arrow or of walling up poor jenny wren alive in a hole in a tree were once celebrations of the passage of the year and offerings to the gods of nature but when the magic necessity was finished with the hunting of a few birds and their needless deaths were just ignorant savagery perhaps they released emotions from the unconscious minds of bigger children who took part in them but in our world of repression and parallel outbursts of physical violence the old rituals must assume a new meaning or we may drift into brainless cruelties on a bigger scale than the killing of wild birds a return to pagan sacrifices even of people is not impossible c a burland echoes of magic xxxiv first light if you could call this offwhite seepage light andy prodded the car into the dull redbrick street with the derelict furniture warehouse hanging over it like a halfexpended curse doing the usual slow slalom between parked cars some families had three or four beatup wrecks summer nights the street would be full of hardfaced kids with spanners trying to make them go faster sound louder not much better at sevenfortyfive on an autumn morning even the kids at home coming off nightshift usually you couldnt park within a couple of hundred yards of your own house today though andy slotted in between a dark rover and a rusting camper van as if the space had been reserved for her the rover looking suspiciously new either a visiting doctor or the police were getting so apathetic the kids were bringing stolen cars home now jesus god shed be glad to get out of here for ever her mind almost made up now just needing one more sign ok this was stupid but it was that kind of decision intuition over logic the air was white and bland and smelled vaguely of gas as she carried her shopping bag to the front door of the middle terrace house shoved her key in the yale slammed the flat of her left hand against the door where the wood had swollen making herself regard the place however temporarily as home again this was the hardest thing a place where she couldnt even make a safe phone call until bobby maiden or whatever passed for him these days came back to collect his life or lose it aw come on for once the door fell open easily due maybe to the other hand above hers on the panel after you mrs anderson the big guy pushing her inside shouldering the door shut behind him flashing the credentials in her face police mrs anderson superintendent riggs marcus faced himself in the bathroom mirror tying todays bow tie the seagreen one the considered formality of the exercise was supposed to give him a grip on the day and by christ this was a day that needed a grip hed drunk four cups of strong tea and had a shower hadnt helped much cindy the bloody shaman was still on the premises supposed to be sleeping on the sofa in the study but marcus had awoken to hear the sound of the tv from down there marcus looked out at the castle walls in the white morning how those ruins had excited him a few years back now just a crumbling pile of medieval dereliction you were legally obliged to keep from crumbling further age and erosion enough of that in the bloody mirror he went downstairs it was strangely quiet no sign of the appalling shaman but the sofa had its cushions neatly arranged as only a woman or a raging poof would leave it malcolm ambled over all right marcus said fair enough he put on his jacket and they walked out across the old farmyard come here dog dont shit in the bloody ruins wanting it all to look pretty for the estate agents camera the dog followed him over the stile onto the footpath through the meadow marcus kept his eyes on the grass a few yards in front of him no longer wanted to look up at high no dammit black knoll you bloody idiot he bawled out suddenly you bloody old fool couldnt believe hed gone along with last nights bollocks take you back to the minutes of your death the trick was the high drama the scenesetting the cloak and the candle the senses fuddled by lack of sleep anyone would be hallucinating at the end of a night like that marcus remembered all that buzz back in the seventies about the psychic surgeons of the philippines or somewhere whod produce handfuls of intestines without the customary incision bollocks a conjuring trick lewis had pulled off something similar last night wake you up get you into a panic thinking maidens dying and then conjuring trick bollocks the mountains were hard as prison walls he needed to be miles away in a town with traffic and fumes and the sound of kids he used to teach now ramraiding currys marcus he stopped because hed had his eyes on the ground he hadnt noticed he wasnt alone in the meadow a still figure in white stood a few yards away unearthly somehow because it was so unexpected the dog strolled over tail waving get you some tea thank you mrs anderson i dont think i can spare the time busy man huh riggs didnt reply shed seen him a few times at the hospital big guy who seemed even taller the way he carried himself with dignity whatever you heard about riggs youd never believe it to look at him and face it very few had heard anything only the likes of bobby and emma curtis and vic clutton he wasnt smiling and yet he was there was one big smug smile fizzing away inside this guy she could feel the heat of it mr riggs was on a roll mr riggs was focused time to stop playing mrs anderson i dont have time to play im a working woman standing in the living room doorway in his bulky leather coat an energy in him all right it made her nervous she hated that let me come to the point sister riggs said loud enough for them to hear next door i believe you know where my officer is your officer maiden riggs said patiently bobby maiden no my responsibility andy wrinkled her nose he walked off the ward as was his right but anything happens to the guy after that its no our problem my understanding is that you considered bobby to be very much your problem leather creaked riggs flexing his shoulders my understanding is that you established quite a rapport you have to do your best with bobby his senses were a wee bit fuddled wouldnae surprise me if he had no memory of me at all by now looking straight up into riggss tawny eyes wherever he is where did he go mrs anderson like hed tell me if you were with him he wouldnt need to tell you according to detective sergeant beattie you were rather evasive about your own whereabouts on the night bobby disappeared aw come on andy spreading her hands laughing you think bobby and me ran away together or something jesus god his head was no that messed up his eyesight was fine no riggs smiled i didnt imagine for one minute that you and he were romantically connected if so he was twotiming you with a woman named emma curtis she tried not to react telling herself she didnt know an emma curtis but its over now riggs said i think i can say that aye last night bobby maiden and emma curtis booked into the collen hall hotel in south wales really andys brain racing what was going on under the name mr and mrs lazarus neat andy said and why was riggs on his own superintendents never went around without a sergeant or two in tow maybe a couple of uniform guys bearing in mind what bobby had to say about riggs how official was this you heard from bobby maiden this morning mrs anderson what the hell is this about no i havent why should i whats goin on riggss eyes were searching the room mr riggs i just got off shift im very tired does your radio work why you follow the archers or something a little early for the archers as i recall but we might catch the eight oclock news may i andy shrugged riggs fiddled with the radio they heard some stuff about a row at the labour party conference riggs sniffed ill tell you this much sister anderson if you do know where maiden is and you fail to tell me while you have the chance ill have you in have me in listen pal either you bloody tell me right now what this is about or ill have you out on suspicion of being an accessory riggs said as if she hadnt spoken to what jesus god you bust in here ah riggs lifted a finger here we are i think youd better sit down the dog wagging his tail going right up to maiden and maiden kneeling down on the grass greeting each other like old friends after an unfortunate misunderstanding tears in maidens eyes again both eyes exposed the patch gone the bad eye still purple maiden still in the sweatpants and the white tshirt that said something about fun time is it marcus whitefaced bloodless lips oh eightish i suppose maiden stood up slowly looked like something that rolled off a mortuary trolley poor sod in the dawn hed followed them down from the knoll hadnt said a word nobody had back at the farm maiden had gone directly to the cottage hed need to sleep the bloody clock round after last night and then what god knew marcus didnt whats happened couldnt have had more than two hours sleep and here he was wandering the fields like a lost soul whats happened marcus dont ask me about it marcus said just dont bloody ask me maiden looked slowly from side to side as though he was seeing the place for the first time as though hed fallen asleep somewhere else and awoken here marcus was aware of his eyes he didnt usually register the colour of peoples eyes but these were blue and clear and unblinking once had these inane bornagain christians at the door or maybe it was mormons fanatics anyway they all had eyes like this better get some breakfast marcus turned unnerved and headed back towards the farm the radio said police investigating the brutal stabbing of a thirtytwoyearold woman in a hotel room in south wales say they want to question a senior detective from the midlands detective inspector bobby maiden disappeared from the hospital where he was being treated for serious head injuries peter tilley reports andy did sit down on the sofa by the bookcase she felt her face muscles go slack in a framed black and white photograph on the wall opposite the early sun came up between the pinnacles of the tower of st marys church on the radio the reporter said mrs emma curtis daughter of a midlands businessman was found dead early this morning by staff at the fourstar collen hall hotel near abergavenny she had multiple stab wounds resulting from what police have described as a frenzied and vicious attack police say mrs curtis a divorcee was staying at the hotel with thirtysixyearold detective inspector maiden who was based at elham in the west midlands several days ago he disappeared from the towns general hospital where he was being treated for head injuries following a hitandrun incident near his home police in gwent and west mercia have declined to expand on a joint statement naming inspector maiden as the only person they want to question in connection with the killing anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to contact police but advised under no circumstances to approach mr maiden who may be in an unstable state of mind hes described as riggs switched off i think we both know what he looks like xxxv malcolm the dog had eyes on different levels in his big white face they could give you the idea that malcolm was unstable dangerous even plus he was part bullterrier with a mouth like a gintrap but bobby maiden knew that malcolm was basically innocent whatever was happening he just wanted to be part of it part of the pack bobby maiden petted the dog and talked to him because this was simple and warming and it didnt make you cry he sat in the study on a hard chair with his back to the window he didnt need ever to move the study was lined with bookshelves separated by bricks there were thousands of books books about big mysteries marcus said what the hells the matter with him what have you done to him not me cindy had been back to the pub for a change of clothing he looked neat and clean and powdered and coiffeured his bangles jangling but the eyes were bloodshot and the makeup extra thick to hide the lines of strain hes like a bloody backward child marcus said he will be fine why dont you make us all some tea marcus feel free to take your time theyd fed bobby maiden local honey on a slice of crisp toast the honey tasted incredible probably nothing had tasted this good since he was a kid which was wrong nothing should taste good this morning why did the honey taste good why did the air taste pure why was he aware of breathing when not twelve hours ago he was sitting in the dark by a dry fountain wishing he was properly dead because of his inability to do the business and the real horror only just beginning there was a clock over the fireplace the only wall without books the clock did not tick it went thock thock thock the clock said malcolm yawned his eyes closed tight and opened maiden thought about emma curtis he remembered awakening once and seeing her eyes in the haze around the candle on the stone as clearly as he saw malcolms eyes now she was dead he didnt know why she died there was no earthly reason she should have died been killed malcolm became a blur marcus is i suppose youd say in denial cindys lefthand bangle displayed amethysts each stone had a vivid interior life like little grayle underhill spent most of his life he has wanting to believe and then something happens and he goes into denial seen it before happened to me even a long time ago no im lying it still happens theres always a part of us that doesnt want to believe and sometimes it takes over and we get angry with ourselves for being so credulous a phase it is thats all bobby maiden was thinking about painting one week soon after liz moved out hed painted only in white acrylic layer upon layer different densities all white cindy held up a white envelope that bulged dont you want to know whats in this bobby not just now if thats ok with you dont you want to ask if you are going through a phase maiden stroked malcolms ears yours isnt a phase bobby youve got trouble you can deal with it or you can run away this is just a respite thinking time it isnt even denial your denial came after you were killed and that wasnt even a conscious thing your inner self blocked it and just as well my love or youd be in a psychiatric hospital by now go bloody mad maiden said in norman plods voice cut their ears off hunched on the edge of her sofa andy felt her insides contract looked at her roughened hands did these things bring back a killer her eyes rose to the photo of the golden valley from high knoll a shock for all of us mrs anderson riggs had his arms folded you think you know someone but you never do quite how was a state registered nurse supposed to live with this she found it hard to look at riggs a long second passed going to destroy his father riggs said i met him recently at the hospital oldfashioned letterofthelaw copper very sad how can you be sure how can you be sure this is down to bobby mrs anderson id give anything if it wasnt believe me the guy looked bowed down with grief were waiting for forensics obviously but ask yourself why if he had nothing to do with it did he leave the scene and when does this kind of murderer ever strike in a hotel room booked for two she felt bobbys head between her hands the incredible holiness of the moment less than two weeks ago oh jesus god think about it riggs said call me he placed a card on the top of the tv set my mobile i cant help you andy said im sorry she stood up riggs turned slowly and examined the picture on the wall mysterious like this was a social call you take this mrs anderson no a friend im trying to place it cotswolds herefordshire andy said drymouthed welsh border i see spend holidays there once or twice riggs nodded moved to the door look if he was the kind to kill a woman andy said desperately then my god would that wee bitch lizzie turner be alive today perhaps she was lucky riggs turned at the door look if it helps you he wont wind up in dartmoor hes a sick man hell get the care he needs soil it is cindy said earth shaking out the last crumbs on marcuss desk i dont get it bobby said this is what came out of you when you vomited on the knoll he rubbed his empurpled eye as though he was only now waking up which perhaps he was awakening perhaps into a different world where there were different laws more crimes in heaven and earth cindy took a soil crystal and rubbed it to powder between finger and thumb im not going to spend hours trying to convince you lovely i saw this come from your mouth onto the stone marcus saw it too but marcus is in denial there we are ok bobby said slowly say i believe it how it seemed to have been in your mouth your throat whether it was ever in your lungs is debatable but cindy wondered how to put this it was certainly in your mind bobby wasnt it deep deep down because this is grave dirt bobbys hand at his throat well yes all right cindy said dirt is dirt but for you he leaned back in his chair hands crossed on his lap the grave powerful night see powerful place powerful energies some of which were your own we channelled them it was a great purging you feel better i feel kind of white there speaks the artist youre a blank canvas again stunning isnt it knocks you back i dont want to move just absorb small things textures good its like when a blind man regains his sight the colours are brighter youre seeing through to the levels you could always see before your perceptions were severely filtered courtesy of your subconscious but perhaps those perceptions didnt fully register before it happened because you were so used to them you could become a real artist now boy it may never happen again relish it i cant emotions fought each other briefly for control of bobbys face he started to cry again for as long as it lasted there would be no inhibitions no embarrassment no social pressures poor dab cindy said how long had you known each other not long she was in the car that knocked me down old mans the vice king of elham drugs prostitution that kind of thing and she knocked you down this girl she caused your death indirectly then you are bound together on the wheel of fate cindy said bobby smiled bitterly through his tears mystic meg huh yes an old mystic meg i am mark my words now tell me what happened in the hotel why were you not there when she died i had a problem kind of problem cindy said more brutally than hed intended couldnt get it up we talked about it she was very kind why couldnt you nerves maybe i mean the nervous system nerves were damaged he rubbed his eyes again a moment of selfdiscovery im lying he said i dont want to say it not even to myself whenever i got close she there was a smell of corruption decay death dead people he fell back on the sofa expelled a great long breath thank you cindy said thank you for that it wasnt from her was it no cindy bent to the desk and brushed the soil with his fingers back into the white envelope i dont imagine it was andy told me i was carrying my own corpse around yes cindy put down the envelope and the rest bobby meaning been listening to your dreams again i have on the tapes do i get to hear that stuff well sadly after you gave up your ghosts as it were to marcuss old cassette machine it now seems to have given up its own packed in bobby not a squeak i see but you were there when it was recording so were you its a blank cindy ah so you going to tell me well all a little confused it is bobby awakened in the middle of a dream few people give a fluid and coherent report the substance of it well it it supports my feeling that you are close to him youre the man bobby you still think cindy held up both hands there was a moment a moment when i thought you were yes when i thought you might be him thanks i still think youre the man who can take me to his door all the people who might have received that night and it has to be you received oh bobby if only you could see the world as i see it look if the night is crisscrossed by radio waves satellite transmissions is it so hard to imagine other levels of communication unseen media through which thoughts and feelings passions longing curses essences are constantly travelling just because nobody invented it it doesnt mean it wasnt there already and part of him came into you a policeman what a lucky break maiden said distantly wheel of fate bobby wheel of fate xxxvi im sorry love amy jenkins wasnt looking too surprised at grayle carrying her suitcase into the bar i never did hold out much hope if your sister was still here wed have known thats a fact a small place this is you cant hide people i guess not could i pay you now not too much daylight made it into this bar but what there was was painful and what will you do now amy was wearing another little black dress with a tiny frilly apron play it day by day i guess see where the trail leads im looking in on this wedding in oxfordshire friends of ersulas sometimes the strangest people turn up at weddings amy pushed grayles bill between the beer pumps or maybe you know she already went home ahead of me maybe i just wanted a holiday an experience an experience the kind that was better looked back on from across an ocean you look to me like you need a holiday amy said frankly grayle looked away wheres uh cindy this morning you tell me my love didnt come back last night room hasnt been slept in an odd person that cindy i feel an enigma like the pyramids hey come on this cant be right too much come on in the hotel in oxford they charged a horrible little room you had amy said im trying to do the place up bit by bit see i can hardly for shame to charge you at all grayle discreetly added another twenty pounds to what it said on the bill and put the money on the bar in a strange way she was finding it hard to leave probably she was going to look back at yesterday as the most shockingly awesome day of her entire life the day her mind blew the day she learned there was more the night she called up her own warped version of ersula and terrified herself into sleeplessness basically the kind of memories that would attach her for ever to st marys well she said awkwardly to amy i hope you like get it together maybe ill come check it out one day you be careful amy said and somehow this wasnt the same as you take care now which was just another way of saying have a nice day jesus it was just too easy in this place to get into the state of mind that made everything appear sinister grayle carried her case to the baby rover parked out in the village street brakes screamed a big green land rover pulled up lower down the street and then reversed until it was alongside grayles hire car the drivers door swinging open before it stopped adrian fraserhale jumped to the ground grayle oh hi adrian stood in the middle of the road he looked severely startled his haystack hair all mussed up maybe the way shed looked when she saw what she saw in the rain at black knoll or maybe just normal for adrian what what are you doing here grayle ive been staying here and now im leaving staying here uhoh it didnt support the cover story too well did it hardly the kind of joint normally frequented by new york journalists on assignment not that it mattered any more local colour grayle said you stay in a big hotel you dont get the same local colour colour adrian said i see he had on a green armytype sweater with patches at the shoulders and elbows there was a camouflage fishing hat in his hand he looked kind of cute and jolly and vaguely out of it which is why im going to the rollright stones she told him i figured like a new age wedding you know great fun adrian said great fun which is why i mean i was looking for you actually we said wed go together didnt we uh right well sure kind of cute but two more hours of this heavyduty hearty englishness when you had a lot on your mind just uh as you see i just checked out that is i wont be coming back thats all right actually i well i was actually rather hoping you could give me a lift to rollright ive got two iffy tyres on this thing and the engines sounding more than a bit ropy fine for shunting around the lanes here but id be rather anxious about the motorway i mean if you wanted to push on somewhere afterwards thats no problem you mean go in this i can easily get a lift back with someone look if you want to leave soon i could zoom down to cefn toss a few wedding sort of clothes in a bag be back here in no time at all isnt roger going oh gosh youre joking nice people but not rogers type i mean you know having them on the summer courses is one thing and taking their money quite adrian looked uncomfortable you wont print that will you golly im so indiscreet grayle smiled ok how about i follow you down to the centre get your stuff super adrian said ill buy you lunch somewhere thatd be real nice and maybe it would a single red circle had been drawn on the ordnance survey map sheet abergavenny and the black mountains spread out on the desk and cindy tapped it with his fibretipped pen this is your collen hall see the name spelt out in gothic lettering which suggests a site of antiquity cindy said now if we consult the buildings of wales we find that collen hall is actually built on the site of a norman castle destroyed during the glyndwr rebellion in the fifteenth century and the castle motte itself may well have been constructed around a prehistoric burial mound agreed marcus seems feasible indeed so you see bobby we have a site of considerable antiquity now if we look around for other evidence of ancient occupancy of this area we find ah this is the rather phallic neolithic stone outside the army camp at cwrtygollen you see the recurrence of that name collen mutates to gollen in the welsh probably a reference to the celtic saint collen anyway a connection all right lets follow the line cindy encircled more spots on the map and then laid a perspex ruler along them and drew two straight lines caer suggests a hill fort or enclosure often a holy hill a place of veneration the lines tend to cut across an edge rather than go through the centre cam is a cairn or mound usually bronze age and if we continue the line past collen hall we come to llanwenarth church which i should imagine is quite ancient maiden peered down at the map what youre saying this is a ley line right and heres another one connecting a cairn another caer and passing through collen hall itself to the very summit of the sugar loaf which is the highest mountain in the area now bobby do you see the way im thinking god cindy what am i supposed to say to that he wanted them to go away he wanted to sit here and look at objects and hear sounds humour the creature marcus said hes been praying to his own peculiar gods that one day a policeman amenable to his ideas would be sent to him true enough cindy smiled coyly nibbling the end of his pen all right maiden said he straightened up said the most detectivelike words he could think of whatve we got going over again why hed had to dump his first theory about the two scumbags sent to the flat in elham because while these insects would cut and dice a copper any night of the week for enough money they would never on pain of slow castration harm tony parkers daughter they might tail her to find maiden but theyd wait until shed gone before they did the necessary no way would they follow them to collen hall maybe going in via the public bar before closing time unlatching a window for later with a view to doing the job on the premises unbelievably risky and awkward the hotel rooms were selflocking from the inside the obvious way would be to tap on the door cough politely announce yourself as hotel management come with clean towels fresh soap whatever and then when it opens you come in fast and hard and noisily dangerously unprofessional and you leave covered in blood besides which whoever it was had gone in after maiden had left the room to make himself an easy target in the grounds which raised the unthinkable that emma curtis was the intended victim putting maiden in the frame a setup too complicated too many potential pitfalls between arrest and a life sentence surely the only other solution was cindys a killer concerned less with the victim than the location a human being cindy said not a supernatural force not an energy an ordinary human being yeah but does he know that because this is the thing with serial killers they dont think theyre ordinary maiden inspected the map in a cursory way focused but not concentrating and it was suddenly incredible the map was alive green hills flexing like muscles bulging into brown roads and rivers wriggling black symbols translating themselves into groups of houses and telephone boxes and stone churches and collen hall in its neat square of tamed countryside a pale glow around it like the glow around caer carn standing stone church the pencil line joining them replaced by a taut wire of white neon he was tingling this guy would feel connected right wired go on cindy said i mean he would feel that because he knows this secret countryside of glowing glowing things hes what am i trying to say in touch with the spirit countryside marcus said which is what a can of worms but if you imagine another layer of existence a numinous landscape both within and around the one we can see if you imagine lewiss hypothetical assassin feeling himself to be somehow moving around in that separate country as the shaman does cindy said marcus groaned but this is what the shaman does cindy insisted he or she or in your case both can move along the spiritpaths shamanic flight fuelled no doubt by a mug or two of magicmushroom tea marcus said cindy ignored him this is what you are doing now bobby in a limited way youre looking at the map and putting yourself into the landscape but the map is not the real landscape the map is a pattern of symbols your mind is able to use to create a landscape which may be even more vivid than what we call the real one does this make sense in a way the glow around collen hall was twice as intense as the others because it marked the confluence of two lines this may be a naive question maiden said but why cant he just enjoy the buzz why does he need to kill people a policeman is asking this cindy was running his hands over the bookshelves i suppose what im looking for is something more meaningful if this guys educated enough to research history and folklore and what have you hes not just a slasher is he see what you mean marcus sat astride an arm of the sofa well these are ritual sites most of them at some time or another have seen sacrifices human or otherwise blood sacrifices blood is the lifeforce blood was shed to fertilize the land goes way back in most societies were looking for an educated primitive savage savage took a blade to her em went in in the dark and shes probably thinking its me perhaps he climbs into bed with her whispering the odd endearment a little heavy breathing finds her throat with his fingers slashes and again and again again until her heads almost off and then what pulls back the bedclothes because theres blood everywhere by now and he cant see what hes doing sticks the knife into her exposed abdomen and rips upwards takes it out puts it back and rips downwards all the way to her stop it bobby you cant change it cindy placed a book on the desk black no dust jacket golden embossed title pagan images i said you were close to him bobby look at his face cindy opened the book xxxvii it occurred to grayle as she waited on the forecourt at the university of the earth that she was going to have to come clean with adrian problem with this wedding was that the bride and groom both knew whose sister she was no way it wouldnt get mentioned before or after whatever kind of ceremony this turned out to be at least there wouldnt be the embarrassment of having to admit to roger falconer that she would not be doing any kind of article on his project adrian had invited her in for coffee but she said she wanted to get to rollright in good time get an idea of what kind of clothes people were wearing now he came bounding out of cefnybedd still in his army sweater looking like the son of the house some young officer played in the movie by yeah yeah hugh grant only a little beefier and with redfords hair he was carrying his stuff in this ridiculous sausageshaped leather bag what the hell is that its a cricket bag adrian said and she started to laugh because this guy would just have to carry his suit in a goddamn cricket bag suddenly feeling better than she had since she arrived here adrian well he might be into dreaming on stones and recording evp messages and all that holy grayle stuff but he did it in this bigschoolboy way that was kind of infectious maybe the whole scene would be healthier if there were fewer stoned wildeyed beardies and more straightup guys like this reversing on the forecourt she glanced in the drivers mirror and saw someone watching them from the porch falconer with his ponytail and his denim shirt and his tight jeans some guy on the courier had once said a ponytail was just a swinging dick you were allowed to wear outside your pants watching falconer watching her as she swung the little car out through the gates she just knew that at some stage of the game this man had fucked ersula no big deal unless he also fucked her mind the foliate face cindy said the green man you saw one on st marys church yesterday and it frightened you maiden leaned over the book hands flat on the desk this is a different face oh theyre all different but substantially the same an image which is half man half vegetation a woodland sprite he is or a fearsome giant with leaves and twigs sprouting from every orifice a personification of nature with enormous energy and fecundity and an absolutely ferocious lifeforce he is a guardian of the earth bobby a god of ecology powerful and forbidding maiden closed the book he doesnt look the kind of guy who helps old ladies with their gardens looks inexplicably malevolent usually seen as a kind of mediator between man and nature who fertilizes the earth but a woman called kathleen basford whos written a study of the chap suggests hes also a symbol of death violent death cindy looked up aggressive enough for it isnt he poured himself a glass of spring water and maiden saw how tired he was looking up all night too and he was not so young there were cracks in the face makeup the bangles hung from knobbly wrists bobby i asked if youd seen the face in one of your unfortunate dreams and i dont think you replied wasnt sure if it was a dream or not couldnt remember i can now h w worthys funeral parlour at the bottom of elham high street a wreath on a mock grave a sombre darkleaved wreath you know how you see things from a certain angle and you sometimes make out a face clouds coals in the fire knots on the back of a door i suppose if you see a face in a wreath its going to look like this remembering when he saw the face in the wreath what had happened to take his mind off the grotesque illusion you look lost bobby how good shed looked in the back of the old sierra in the twilight aglow in her orange sweatsuit looking so happy to see him loveatfirstsight situation love at second meeting love life gets complicated dont it he sat down again tell me everything about this bugger and cindy brought him the letter the letter was wordprocessed in old english type came this morning cindy said stick to the truth lewis post hasnt even arrived yet it was faxed marcus i havent got a bloody fax no but i have i brought it in from the car while you were getting what sleep you could manage and then i telephoned my friend gareth from crucible magazine and prised him from his bed crucible magazine what the hell is that its a pagan periodical with a circulation no doubt approximating to the phenomenologists marcus scowled im going to make some more tea but less credibility among elderly ladies cindy called after him read the letter bobby youll notice it begins somewhat unusually for crucible with a polite dear sir the more usual term of address being one imagines something more on the lines of hey listen mandear siras a sporadic reader of your publication and other pagan periodicals i must object to the assumption that those of us who believe ourselves to be more attuned to the living pulse of the earth must automatically be opposed to country sportby country sport i mean of course blood sport while i deplore the use of the appendage sport i can understand why it is applied by equating the ritual shedding of blood with such pursuits as football and tennis it gains a certain social respectability in these anaemic timesan essential element in the physical and spiritual equilibrium of a planet or country is the regular freeflowing of blood in the open airas your readers ought to know blood is the original creative and materializing medium it is the physical substance best capable of interpenetrating the planes it has been used and sometimes misused by magicians throughout history to assist in the manifestation of spirits and daemonsit is also vital for the sustenance of the spirit of the earth when a fox is killed after the cumulative energy of the chase it is a holy moment the violent spurting of the blood equates with the climactic instant of orgasm both the energy and the blood itself are absorbed by the earth and converted to fuel both the planet and the human racethere are of course places upon the surface of the earth where the shedding of blood is most effective and for this logical reason rites of sacrifice were practised by the oldest cultures of the earth the insistence by many modern pagans that blood sacrifice is unnecessary and barbaric is unbelievably stupid and damaging to all that your readers purport to hold deargreen is the opposite colour to red and therefore it follows that these two colours represent the essential friction without which we shall all weaken and perishas long as it continues to embrace vegetarianism and oppose the killing of animals in the wild the socalled green movement and the socalled pagans who support it is a dangerous shamyours faithfullythe real green man no signature no address cindy said gareths excuse for not publishing it a nutter maiden said oh no bobby sadly not a nutter at all a valid argument it is in theory but hardly as he implies one that the bloodsport fraternities would use in defence of their rural pursuits ok maiden said lets get this right when you first told us about this you said that some woman argued that when william ii was topped in the new forest his blood dripped all the way along the road from the sacrificial site in the new forest to salisbury cathedral according to margaret murray the ultimate fertilizer for the earth because william was as she put it the divine victim the godking human blood being more effective in this guys view in the view of every primitive tradition in the world bobby than animal blood so hes taken to hunting people because he believes the earth needs it especially with all the threats to traditional blood sports right i think you may have grasped the essential point hes mad maiden said no as i keep saying he is not this man is not a conventional psychopath he even prefers his victims to be people who according to his philosophy might well deserve to die he is a man with a cause he believes utterly in what he is doing and he has some rather influential support what id like to show you a videotape on the television little grayle underhill gave it to me bless her well wait for marcus to return be especially receptive to this he will but when marcus came in from the kitchen he looked in no mood for tv he was carrying a radio he looked no less exhausted than cindy and a lot more agitated maiden theyre giving your name out who are the police on the radio christ theyre as good as saying you murdered that woman say if anyone spots you they shouldnt approach you theyre saying youre bloody well unstable theyre not wrong are they maiden sighed maybe the whole thing was a setup he tried to feel angry but there was no tension in him only a dark sorrow bobby cindy put down his glass how long do you think before they find out where you are well they probably suspect im still in the area i dont know theyll lean on andy maybe hard so best thing is if i just walk into abergavenny police station and no sit down do you really want to go to prison itd give me a bit of time to think maiden said heavily pending the trial pending the appeal while this man goes on killing maiden sighed i dont know i dont know what to believe we need you bobby look at us marcus and me old men an endofthepier embarrassment and the editor of an excuse for a magazine dying slowly and ignominiously pathetic we are bastard marcus muttered xxxviii i uh i have a confession grayle said they were through hereford headed for the malvern hills adrian fraserhale had his long legs stretched out the passenger seat pushed back as far as it would go he beamed youre going to tell me youre not really a journalist your name isnt turner and in fact youre ersula underhills sister am i right grayle damn near hurled the car into the hedge hey calm down old girl adrian folded his hands behind his head roger found out he was bound to you know oh jesus grayle slowed down he talked to uh marcus bacton right youre joking roger absolutely cant stand marcus bacton no when youd gone yesterday he put in a call to the new york courier roger is terribly paranoid he thinks other academics are trying to steal his ideas or hijack his tv programme the more powerful people seem the more insecure they are so anyone who shows up at cefnybedd he wants to know who exactly they are and what connections they might have pretty stupid of me grayle said anyway the courier said they didnt have a grayle turner but theyd recently parted company with a grayle underhill wasnt awfully hard to put two and two together hes mad at me right i suspect he isnt terribly pleased to be honest hell get over it adrian grinned at least it means i wont have to watch what im saying any more the reason i didnt just come and say who i was i had a feeling of well of maybe something going on between roger and ersula people told me all this stuff about what a ladies man he was adrian chuckled well grayle said if shed like got hurt and i mean when it comes to men being this kind of hardassed intellectual isnt you know what im saying actually yes one always had the feeling that behind that cool facade she was really a terribly vulnerable girl im an oldfashioned sort of chap and a bit of a sucker for a lady in distress and well you know what can one say i did rather fancy her myself im afraid that amiable buffoon adrian fraserhale oh jeez poor adrian although it pretty soon became apparent that i wasnt you know quite shall we say cerebral enough to compete with roger roger adrian grimaced he really is such a frightful bastard the great pyramid well a great pyramid the one arranged in steps all pyramids looked the same to bobby maiden except this one with the steps roger falconer was halfway up vaguely listening to a short guy with a beard who was having to breathe so hard to keep up with him that it was taking the edge off the theory he was airing falconer would listen to his companions stuff with an occasional nod and then do this expression that was nearer to a lopsided smile than a sneer but you got the idea before sliding in some piece of superior knowledge like a stiletto leaving the short guy spluttering wrong episode cindy said flick it forward half an hour as we wont see the end maiden said who wins the phone rang ignore it cindy said the little chap has a heart attack marcus reached for the phone but falconer has to finish his piece to camera before calling for an ambulance and so he dies id better get it might be the police cindy said better we know about it than they just show up here with their armalites or whatever theyre sending the buggers out with these days marcus snatched the receiver yes oh anderson oh god maiden thought really should have tried to call her at the hospital shell have heard it on the radio seen it on tv or someone will be all round the general by now yes i know that marcus was saying absolutely not if the bastards saying that its a putup job tell him where he can stick it no hes all right he what name right no dont dont worry yes call me tonight marcus put down the phone just reassure me that she was calling from the hospital maiden said whos this bastard riggs i told you about him oh hes the one hes been to see anderson told her its an openandshut case and they need to put you away for your own good that sort of thing she tell him anything of course not solid as a rock anderson and she was at the hospital no he came to her home she waited for half an hour or so after hed gone and then she went to a phone box maiden moaned for heavens sake maiden they cant tap every bloody phone box in the town no but what they can do is keep an eye on her if shes seen to enter a phone box at say ninefifteen they obtain from our friends at british telecom a computer printout of the numbers dialled from that particular box around that time oh yeah how long before they get this address i may not stay for lunch better get the hell out now then hadnt you but not before we watch the video cindy picked up the remote control video are you mad lewis sorry bloody stupid question its a video little grayle was given of professor falconers programme lewis i wouldnt watch that shit if the only alternative was the generation game sit down marcus maiden looked over at the window and then at the clock may be advisable to fastforward where you can but like hold on i thought you were buddies ok coming at it from different directions pretending to despise each others approach but its all goodnatured banter thats just for the punters adrian said roger and i really dont have much to do with each other dont have much in common but you live i live in a bedsit over the stables roger lives in the house when hes here which isnt actually that often he can only stand so much of the countryside he likes dinner parties that sort of thing also hes very much of his generation sometimes smokes marijuana grayle stifled a laugh he sounded so disapproving hard to believe england was still manufacturing men like this we just sort of need each other adrian said he needs someone who can get on with people and knows all about earthmysteries but isnt otherwise terribly bright oh adrian well its true i come from a long line of solid chaps who are not terribly bright but pretty practical im a useful guy to have around turn my hand to most things i rigged out the portakabins laid rogerss helicopter pad things like that im impressed its a way of earning my keep when theres no course on you see i need him too who else would employ someone to take parties on outwardbound trips to ancient sites and supervise dreaming experiments lie in stone circles all night with a tape recorder you love it dont you its my whole life adrian said i put up with roger for as long as its necessary you said he was a bastard he uses people hes unscrupulous i dont think theres anyone he wouldnt use or anything he wouldnt do to put himself ahead of the field his field he has to be you know preeminent in his field archaeology bigger than that now his field embraces anthropology psychology and the more acceptable areas of parapsychology hes like one of these wealthy farmers who pulls out ancient hedges to develop this huge private enclosure sounds almost scary megalomania its ok adrian said it helps if you know how youre being used the wind is blowing roger falconers hair into his eyes as the camera tracks him to the summit of the small hill not much more than a bulge in the middle of a green field falconer turns to camera this bronze age round barrow is known for no satisfactory reason as jed balkins mump whoever jed balkin was the farmer who has to plough this field rather wishes hed stuck his mump somewhere else but why did those prehistoric surveyors choose to put it here well if we look to the west the camera following his pointing finger goes into a zoom we can see the tower of st annes church which as we noted earlier appears to have been built on another prehistoric burial mound and if we look east falconer back in the picture spins round the same arm outstretched like a signpost we can see a small wood now close up on professional smile if i were some species of springheeled sprite and i were to take a mighty leap in a dead straight line falconer braces himself into the very centre of that wood the screen fills with sky falconers voiceover where do you think a racing blur of greenery i would land the picture jolting and then settling on falconer standing in the centre of a circle of small stubby stones enclosed by trees this is the ninestones circle although as you can see there are only seven left its a key feature of what even i have to admit is one of the more credible of thousands of alleged ley lines connecting ancient sites all over britain our new age friends would claim that this invisible line marks a flow of terrestrial energy across the landscape the lifeforce of the earth if theyre right i should be getting a stiff shot of the stuff through my system at this very moment falconer bending down to place his hands over a stone no more than two feet tall smiling the kind of smile that says precisely what he thinks of this new age garbage close up to the new agers stone age and bronze age person was a wise and civilized soul very much into peace and love and celestial harmony he or she would probably have sat where im sitting now meditating and being at one with nature falconer stands up sheer nonsense of course the new agers have reinvented the stone agers in their own image in reality words like peace and love would have meant nothing to these people the key word for them would have been survival falconer stalking through the woods now like an explorer stone age man and perhaps stone age woman too moved through the landscape like a guerrilla in tune with the earth well of course he was he recognized that the earth was his provider that a relationship was crucial to his continued existence but lets not beat about the bush this was a relationship cemented tight into falconers savage grin with blood a rustling in the undergrowth the camera pans across the flight of a frightened rabbit into a bush falconers voiceover if anything sharpened the senses of neolithic people raised their perceptions gave them an instinctive feel for the environment it was the hunt shots of familiar cave paintings showing lumpen bovine creatures getting speared hunting killing was a natural pivotal aspect of a neolithic lifestyle which would one suspects thoroughly disgust our new age friends fulllength shot of falconer holding a twelvebore shotgun blood sports hunting shooting are anathema to many supporters of the green movement but green and red are opposites which throughout history have been linked together and theres little doubt that the original green man was a hunter a stalker who understood that the true undiluted lifeforce was a flow a gush of lifeblood falconer emerging from the wood into the field where jed balkins mump swells like a boil its surely naive to deny the extent to which the religous beliefs and rituals of our remote ancestors were linked to violent death sound of hunting horn and shots of traditional hunt redcoated men and women and yelping hounds the ritual aspects of the hunt as practised by some of britains oldest families are inescapable this is still the most dynamic example of a flow of real energy through the landscape cut to group of huntsmen oh yes an old guy with huge sidewhiskers theres no doubt about it the chase absolutely takes one over i never feel more alive indeed at the height of the chase one feels immortal godlike i suppose all i know is that when i cant hunt itll be time ha ha to put me in the ground the old huntsman clambering onto his horse falconers voiceover so which is closest to the earth this man or this woman cut to shot of flaxenhaired beauty in a cloak and headband sitting in lotus position at the foot of a standing stone cut back to falconer his back to a church wall the tower rearing behind his head theres now a body of opinion which maintains that psychologically and sociologically we took a wrong turning when we abandoned the spear and the bow for the plough when we ceased to be huntergatherers and became farmers out of agriculture came urban life a cauldron of constantly recycled energy out of urban life was born stress frustration crime domestic violence what we like to call civilization was this the fall of man its an issue well be debating in the studio in next weeks edition of diggers join us then credits roll a university of the earth production for channel four silence cindy switched off the set well marcus sat up no wonder he was guest of honour at the bloody hunt ball interesting isnt it my loves notice he said the original green man not a million miles from the real green man some of the phrases are almost the same maiden said that about red and green of course the green man may simply have seen that programme television puts ideas into peoples heads this guy sees that programme a week later he thinks its his own concept cindy slid the videotape into its sleeve the programme was transmitted as far as i can make out last july the letter was received by crucible nearly a year ago could have been the other way round then falconer saw the letter it fitted the angle he was after so he developed the idea for his programme academics are terrible magpies isnt that right marcus vultures it wasnt printed bobby maybe somebody else printed it possibly cindy conceded the other alternative marcus said expressionless is that falconer wrote the letter himself why hed do that i dont know maybe he was fishing for reaction well maiden stood up why dont we go and ask him yes get you out of the house wouldnt it lovely why not marcus was on his feet personally i wouldnt miss this for i dont think so cindy said id hate you to get overemotional listen lewis the bastard has some explaining to do if theres any basis to your crackpot theory at the very least hes going to have an idea of the kind of person stupid enough to be influenced by his ideas about the bloodlust of neolithic man right but at best maiden said all it does is link the letterwriter to the programme the rest is conjecture youre both in your separate ways too close to this ill go under what pretext maiden as a copper or as the most wanted man in britain possibly unstable ill have thought of something by the time i get there you be very careful bobby cindys eyes were hooded watchful in some ways you are closer to this than either of us xxxix she could picture the wounds all too clearly and it didnt make her feel sick just angry as hell she was supposed to sleep now go on up to bed get in six hours awake refreshed for the saturday slaughterhouse shift oh aye the perfect sedative two people youd got fond of and the police were saying one had killed the other and they needed to put him away for his own good and the hunt was on nationwide marcus had said no absolutely not no way was bobby maiden a murderer which naturally he would clearly wanting to get her off the line which suggested bobby was with him or he knew where bobby was and she ought to go down there not least because the whole scenario had started to unroll under her own hands in a and e that day at am but even getting to the phone box had felt as public as the first bloody moonwalk andy kept looking out of the window for strange cars in the street but it wouldnt be that obvious sat down with a fresh pot of tea closed her eyes and there was emma curtis a nice girl a great girl face up on some mortuary slab she set down the cup and saucer stood up and paced if it wasnt bobby then who if the bastards saying that its a putup job marcus said to put bobby in the frame somebody killed her to hang it on bobby protect themselves some big megalomaniac copper had it done did such things really happen jesus god it made your head swell just to think about it made you want to drive down to police hq and accuse riggs very loudly very publicly of being bent as a coathanger pull the lid off the can of worms and hope the worms had wriggled all over town by the time they took you away get it in the elham messenger sure two paragraphs bottom of page nine nurse charged with public order offences jesus god there had to be something she could do there was only one v clutton in the elham phone book there was no answer after a few minutes andy decided to go and see tony parker they came out of tewkesbury in gloucestershire headed for the cotswolds the countryside looking milder more ordered around twelvethirty adrian suggested they grab some lunch can we afford to stop for lunch will we make it in time loads of time adrian said oh but then you wouldnt know would you huh matthew rang last night theyve decided to put off the ceremony until late afternoon early evening the rollrights are open to the public so they realized they were going to have quite a few unwanted guests tourists people like that it is saturday after all anyway matt thought it would be a better atmosphere if they waited till dusk candles and lanterns and all that frightfully romantic right grayle was dubious it was a dull day but not too cold an evening wedding would be well atmospheric in a sinister kind of way you think that is a romantic setting the rollright stones you dont well maybe it just wasnt a nice day when i went there seemed kind of a forbidding place which was odd i guess when you think how close it is to the road and all it seemed i dunno kind of mean the way the stones are like curly and notched and knobbly she snatched a glance at adrian to gauge his reaction saw a look of concern on his youngofficers face he said you really didnt care for it maybe it was just an emotional reaction grayle said probably the way i was feeling that day id hoped to get some hard information about where ersula could be and i didnt call it personal negativity nothing scientific because you see grayle this is a holy place its not supposed to be cosy any more than a great cathedral is its an integral part of a huge sacred pattern nobody not even roger denies that any more its another level another britain which were only just finding our way around again right maybe its because britain is so small grayle thought if they want to discover anything new about it it has to be on some invisible level and what we dont understand we naturally fear people are just as primitive in that way as they ever were theyre just more shielded from the dark its a fear were jolly well going to have to conquer those of us who want to evolve all kinds of fears all kind of blocks were going to have to break through them if were going to get in tune with the earth again before its too late aw gee grayle pulled the gear lever to low for a steep downward slope how to put this how to tell him shed heard all this before see you guys you come on like we got to tune in to holy places we got to recover our lost knowledge our forgotten ancient wisdom jesus i used to talk like this all the time and thats the problem isnt it adrian put his big warm hand over hers on the lever its all talk its just a coffee table thing so few people do anything imagine if the druids had simply you know theorized gosh for them it was real life life and death so if the rollrights feel sort of brooding thats why uh why grayle felt herself blushing tugged her hand back to the wheel because its been a working site it isnt all manicured and prettified like some monuments some of the new age people would be absolutely horrified if they actually knew what it was like in the ancient days they all think it was some sort of golden age and perhaps it was but it was a cruel age too or rather people today might think of it as cruel but it was necessary you mean sacrifices as they drove into the cotswolds the countryside was lightening up the stone becoming golden against a white sky like the fluffy lining in a jewel box people try to close their eyes to it grayle they say oh even in the degenerate period when the priests practised human sacrifice they only sacrificed criminals who deserved it well what kind of a sacrifice is that thats not sacrifice its execution surely its only a real sacrifice if you give up the life of someone you dont hate who hasnt done you any personal harm and perhaps the ultimate sacrifice is to take well the life of a friend i suppose but when would it be worth losing a friend for oh thats just a modern attitude look at the bible god tested abrahams faith his absolute conviction by asking for the blood of his son and off they went to a high place a holy site and they built an altar and abraham took a knife but that was just a test surely god never intended him to follow through depends how you look at it abraham was being shown that if he ever wanted true wisdom to walk with the gods i mean people in several civilizations did sacrifice their children plus this was the old testament god prechrist we progressed from that stuff but we didnt progress did we in a lot of ways we did did christ ask for blood sacrifices grayle christ was a blood sacrifice this was all getting a little heavy for grayle after yesterday she needed to lighten up shed hoped being with adrian goodlooking guy for heavens sake roughhewn countryboy charm whyd he have to be so intense about all this and who did that remind you of you talk about all this stuff with ersula ersula understood as an anthropologist oh yes wed talk for hours and hours and roger would she talk for hours with roger youre asking me if she had an affair with roger you told me yesterday she left in a hurry well you know i mean adrian looked uncomfortable jesus he was fine talking about ancient blood ritual and sacrificing your kids but you changed the subject to like contemporary sexual relations he got embarrassed i suppose its possible i know its possible adrian but did it happen adrian swallowed and grayle began to see how it might have been adrian majorly turned on by ersula by her intensity her passion for the past the very stuff that put most guys off but ersula finds adrian a little raw and gauche especially up against roger smooth eloquent experienced the kind of man who could intellectualize his way right into your pants perhaps falconer had it right you needed to hunt you needed the friction the wind of the chase just to keep on living maiden had come on foot cefnybedd was less than a mile from castle farm along the path towards the meadow but instead of going up towards the knoll you detoured down a halfovergrown footpath over a stile and into the woods he felt a sharp edge of purpose the fresh air sang with sensation there was a light rain of crinkling leaves birds probably undisturbed for months flew for the exits a squirrel sped across the path in front of him it was a curious state of mind not at all happy but hyperaware so alive it ached he was hunting falconer a man with a lot of questions to answer and yet he kept looking behind him leaves rustled in his wake twigs snapped it was probably wildlife rabbits birds not many people came this way the wildlife would be spooked but he kept looking over his shoulder quite a heavy crunch this time and he spun round and thought he saw a face framed in foliage and thought in shock green man green man green man the green man hunting him and then there was big noise everywhere and he didnt know where to run as with this huge angry clattering a helicopter white and red lifted up apparently out of the centre of the wood not fifty yards away in a golden storm of october leaves crows rose screaming the helicopter hovered under the sheet of the sky rotors churning the helicopter was very hardedged and real it meant that roger falconer was leaving maiden breathed out slowly in dismay thank you thanks a bunch roger the machine was directly above him now and he instinctively bent and moved forward in a crouch through the trees and found he was on the edge of a clearing with a big slab of flat fleshcoloured concrete at its centre he walked around the clearing keeping close to the trees watched the chopper banking heading off south the crows calmed down his spirits sagged what would he have done anyway flashed his id and hoped falconer hadnt heard the radio this morning it was all so flimsy so fanciful as the noise dwindled to a distant drone he sat on a mossed and slimy fallen branch head in his hands the way hed sat last night by the well at collen hall so convenient so conveniently timed just hours after cindy airs his wild theory about the mystical killer who needs to spill blood at holy places the killer strikes again under maidens nose a pigeon or something rattled in the bushes like cindys bangles on those bony wrists cindy this ageing transsexual probably actor reduced to the end of the pier embittered by sneers pining for applause living half his life in a fantasy dimension where kites talk and shamans fly grabbing his chance for a final blaze of public attention cindy invents a bizarre solution to the murder of his landladys daughter hampshire police kindly show him where the door is he becomes obsessed any unsolved murder he finds in the papers he works it into his theory the police arent laughing any more hes become a nuisance finally hes reduced to trying to involve the failed magazine editor marcus bacton by convincing him theres something unnatural about the death of his housekeeper only to find conveniently staying with marcus another policeman a sick screwedup policeman ripe for conversion but the policeman is sceptical he needs to be shown the truth maiden went cold was this it was this the truth had cindy followed them in his old morris minor to colleen hall had cindy given the performance of his life casting himself in the role of the imaginary ley killer but he wouldnt have had time would he would cindy have had time after slashing emma to get back to st marys to take the call from maiden hed been there all night with marcus no you only assumed he had maiden began to sweat with paranoia he saw cindy in his shamanic cloak of feathers a giant bird of prey in his hand a sacrificial knife the theatrics the melodrama an actor manipulating reality a woman walked into the clearing from the other side maiden dived back into the trees she glanced his way just once she was carrying a pickaxe she hefted it looked down at her feet swung the pick with both hands high above her head and brought it down so savagely that when the pick connected with the concrete all the breath came out of her in a sharp cry he watched her for several minutes she was making a mess lumps of concrete spun across the helipad dust sprayed up at her flapping barbour coat and into her dark curly hair she didnt care she pushed one point of the pick into a crack and swung back from the handle straining damn you the pick prised out a slab about eighteen inches across and she fell backwards the handle clipping her under the chin she screamed and let go and rolled over into the rubble shit maiden walked out across the concrete can i help the woman froze on the concrete contracting like a caterpillar a hand at her jaw looking up at him for just an instant she looked as if she might be terrified then she coughed and grabbed hold of the pick and came up scowling no you cant help go away this is private land she had the kind of voice that went naturally with words like private and land are you ok im fine piss off could take you a while to chop up the whole pad maiden said are you going or do i have to call he took a chance call it intuition there was something interesting here he pulled out his wallet it felt strange flashing the warrant card something the other bloke used to do before he died police he said she stared at him this time the fear was real but soon controlled she was younger than hed thought early thirties she had a wide mouth green eyes the kind of takeitforgranted careless beauty that said breeding and then yawned he said and you are magda ring i work here as admin manager controller and the professors just taken off in his helicopter and youre fixing it so he cant get back right dont be ridiculous i i was maiden smiled she really couldnt think of an adequate explanation of why she was hacking up falconers helipad look magda ring rose up you might be police but this is still private land you can either tell me what you want or bugger off he overturned a slab of concrete with his shoe underneath there was red soil stone grit its not very deep is it why should it be i dont know he borrowed the pick shifted another lump i dont know anything about helicopters are they very heavy the pick snagged he pulled it it ripped through fabric he bent and pulled out what appeared to be a sleeve it was nylon quilted it smelled bad christ magda ring said softly how did you know how the fuck did you know he bent and lifted out a weighty concrete cube there was most of a nylon coat down there when he pulled more of it away a rich putridly familiar stench started to pulse and wriggle out of the hole the smell was a living thing as always it was islington two heads fallen together on a sofa flies and kiddy porn maiden turned his face to the sky swallowed a long breath looked down what you could see of the body was partly liquefied it lay in a soupy brown sludge half the face was visible features darkened puffed blistering magda ring cried out once turned and stumbled away maiden gagged and bit hard on the sleeve of his jacket when he found he was starting to shake he too walked away from the edge of the wood like some comical gulping birdcall came the sound of someone vomiting magda on her hands and knees among the autumn mulch burnt sienna yellow ochre and sour pink xl he was hardly what you expected but come on hen what did you expect black suit slickedback hair white skin ronnie kray rosebud lips well the black suit was right very classy but there wasnt enough hair to slick back and the skin was closer to yellow he wore thick glasses had the manner of an oldfashioned accountant distant distant you could understand today the black suit too sister anderson his hand felt like the inside of a banana skin you some variety of nun andy smiled nursing sister oh right he didnt look too well signs of high blood pressure could be liver trouble too he was older than shed figured seventy maybe how could a guy this old still be doing what they said he was doing young men she could just about get her head around it the lure of easy money plus the illusion that you were invincible this guy was well beyond all that thank you for seeing me mr parker time like this yeah well tony parker motioned to a hard chair on andys side of the desk you told them downstairs it was about my an eye twitched dragging down loose skin daughter aye like how else would she have got in to see him so go on he nodded at the two black phones on his desk ive told them to hold all calls cept for the wife if it rings ill go out no need we aint that close any more she lives down in essex got her sister wiv her his voice was dry his london accent trimmed he looked like a man who didnt cry much but spent a lot of time thinking in andys experience crying was simpler and much more therapeutic im more sorry than i can say id got to know her a little great girl yeah he was slumped in a highbacked swivel chair it was the only sign of luxury in the room the desk was scuffed old rather than antique looked like it had come out of one of the old feeny park solicitors offices there were no pictures on the walls this was really emmas old man this office was over parkers towncentre nightspot the biarritz who the hell had clubs called the biarritz and the st moritz any more only fading guys like this in towns like elham it had gone quiet tony parker gazed past her out of the window at the beauteous elham skyline the old parish church the new techcollege building he looked like he was already forgetting she was here of course riggs would know by now that shed come whatever she said here would get back to him every word of it and quickly i also know bobby maiden andy said really when he had his accident i was with the team that brought him round parker looked at her youll pardon me if i dont recommend you for a medal what i wanted to say was hes no the kind of guy would do this thing thats it you come here to say that no what she came to say was if anything should happen to bobby maiden theres me here this bigmouthed glaswegian harpy who knows who its down to and by coming here parking out front also indirectly conveying this information to mr riggs you come here parker said to try and tell me that piece of fucking shit did not kill my daughter get out get the fuck out of my office sister anderson andy didnt move youre makin a mistake tony could feel her accent thickening like phlegm in her throat somebody came on aggressive it usually happened tony parker didnt speak clearly couldnt believe she hadnt gone your friend mr riggs was round just now figured i might know where bobby was hidin out

sister a phone rang parker picked up the one next to it yeah take her back say ill call her who all right yeah hung up lifted his sick eyes to andy who might act hastily mrs anderson a few people might given the circumstances truth was he didnt look capable of haste he looked like a man on whom age had crept up like a mugger turned round and thump never saw it till it happened wakes up with no hair and thick glasses and he has to cut down on his drinking and his late nights and london doesnt seem so homely and elham is a tacky wee retirement haven in the care of kindly superintendent riggs sad eh parker said youre from glasgow aintcher aye but i was educated at roedean as you can tell you people parker shook his head youre all barbarians up there act hastily jesus wept a digital timer on his desk bleeped twice and parker took a goldplated pillbox from his top pocket save us all from television he put a small white pill on his tongue and swallowed it you should take water with that andy said parker looked politely contemptuous you need to look after yourself mr parker why he put away the pillbox he didnt look at all well that girl was the only kid i had i was gonna sell this lot set her up nice whatever she wanted i think she wanted you to slow down talked about me did she a wee bit he stared at her hed probably aged a couple of years since she came in andy stood up moved round the desk parker watched her without much curiosity she went behind him placed both her hands on his forehead whats this sister reiki japanese therapy thing his skin felt like crepe paper never heard of it cost me damn near two grand for the courses parker grunted talking his language shut up close your eyes shed given him nearly ten minutes reiki when the phone rang unplug the fucker parker said andys hands moved down his face she didnt think about high knoll after a while tony parker fell asleep when he awoke there were tears drying in the hollows of his cheeks he was maybe too relaxed to notice after a minute or two he said you want a job sister eightfifty a week and a lump sum when im brown bread he didnt seem to know he was crying it could be powerful the reiki if the patient was willing to disconnect im no looking for a job andy said but you can do me one favour just tell me if you did anything hasty this morning xli following magda ring towards the mellow farmhouse home of the university of the earth maiden felt a spasm in his chest a brief tightening sensation was all it was and the other bloke would have ignored it but the other bloke was only aware of surface things and the other bloke died magda almost fell at the door shoving in a long key as though she was desperate to put that fat slab of oak between her and the smell of corrupting flesh tainting the grounds of cefnybedd he could understand that but he also understood that the tightening of the chest was a response to a deepdown feeling that this house enclosed something darker and worse and personal as if hed followed a preordained trail and the trail ended not at the grave in the concrete but here in this quiet old house he followed her into a big square hall with a wide wooden staircase several doors leading off a deep window halfway up the stairs and on the only blank wall almost exclusively lit by this window a picture a picture which sent a weight slamming into his chest like a wrecking ball fracturing some old factory wall turner he was transfixed j m w bloody turner his heart seemed to crunch adrian had steak done rare grayle compromising with a ploughmans lunch with cheese was surprised see most of the new age people i know are vegetarians adrian groaned oh really grayle an interest in earthconsciousness doesnt necessarily make one new age those people are doing our subject so much damage as the cavepaintings so amply demonstrate neolithic people were hardly veggies they hunted they hunted to live and they lived to hunt lecturing again the didactic side of him taking over changing him from schoolboy to schoolteacher it was beginning to irritate her grayle shook her hair out of her eyes and also also apart from placing his hand over hers on the gear shift that time his interest in her as a woman seemed actually to be receding no problem sure a goodlooking guy and she was unattached but anything of a personal nature could only be a complication and right now she had enough of those it was just that a little recognition thats all of mutual attraction generally made things easier hohum too late now theyd soon be among a whole bunch of people celebrating having a good time the pub was just outside stowonthewold and less than a dozen miles from the rollright stones it was old like the rams head at st marys but it had polished panelling and brass lamps and it was full suggesting a wealthier more populous area well all right adrian sawing up pink steak real efficient a lot of the people on the courses are naturally new agers and its my job to keep them amused but really i mean some of them are such incredibly silly shallow inconsequential people that its a struggle sometimes to hide ones contempt jesus was this ersula or was this ersula what about janny and matthew theyre kind of new age arent they a shadow crossed his eyes theyre nice people theyre friends something here she wasnt getting howd you get into this stuff adrian grayle abandoned onto a side plate the cob of squelchy white bread that came with her lunch didnt get into it he pushed a piece of meat into his mouth got into me you dont want that bread sure help yourself it the earth always aware of her of course he grabbed the bread took a bite grew up in wiltshire father was an army officer stonehenge was always there better seen from a distance rather lost its magic with all the main roads and tourists and the army all manoeuvres no real anyway at least aveburys surviving despite the undesirables it attracts at avebury i had a sort of vision a calling i suppose in a churchminister kind of way in exactly that kind of way to go out and spread the word about earthmysteries but thats not enough is it everybodys just living on the earth we should live in her and she in us we should move with her breathe with her sounded kind of sexual whered you get this adrian whered it come from from he looked surprised from the earth of course no i mean which books in particular books he was almost shouting strands of steak clung to his teeth i received it from the earth grayle i received it yeah sure but feeling herself going red i mean how he looked at her for a long time the way a teacher looks at the dumbest kid in the class when the kid reveals by some inane answer that it hasnt grasped what the lesson was even supposed to be about the dreaming adrian said im sorry you get guidance from dreams of course guidance instructions look you dont seem to realize the dreaming is the university of the earth youre surrendering your consciousness to the oldest teacher of all and when youve been doing it for so long when youve shown youre ready to serve her the earth will tell you what she wants from you ersula had written what you are dealing with here is the unconscious and that must be lift to find its own route to what you would probably call enlightenment adrian how long you been doing this oh i dont know several years put it this way adrian began to mop up the remains of his gravy with the remains of grayles cob of white bread so far ive spent hold on tell you exactly seven hundred and thirtyeight nights in ancient sites what it was why i just had to have this job i can take groups of students all over the country to sleep at sacred sites go alone first of course to test them out she had a picture of him some big boy scout with his knapsack leading a crocodile of wellheeled innocents in anoraks the sites know me now most of the guardians know me of course if a certain guardian has a particularly fearsome aspect i wont take students there adrian grinned wouldnt do to lose one of the poor punters through a heart attack or something grayle recalled matthew lyall talking of the grotesque haglike guardians invading your dreams barring the way also recalled what cindy had said about the death of mrs willis at the knoll a stroke can be quite terrifying at first adrian said mind you it can also be a wonderfully healthy thing quite often after a dreaming youll notice that the subjects health has improved he looked past grayle at green hills through a window his knife in one hand the last of the bread in the other funny thing when i spend a night in an ordinary bed i feel quite disoriented dislocated you know dislocated jesus was this any wonder after seven hundred and thirtyeight nights inside prehistoric ritual temples according to ersula just a couple of experiences could blow your mind well it was clear enough now what this guy did he odd he odd on the dreaming turned himself into a dreamjunkie but adrian what happens when the dreaming experiment comes to an end when all the stuff goes into the computers adrian threw down his knife it will never end its already way beyond an experiment do you really think we can learn all the earth has to teach us in a few years in a lifetime even let me get this right oh boy just when you think all the worlds crazies are gathered in la with a small new york overspill you see the university of the earth developing into some kind of channel into like a universal planetary consciousness already is and one day ill prove it at present she speaks to just a few of us in our dreams one day quite soon shell speak to everyone youll hear her youll all hear her the evp tapes you think one day youll get to record the voice of perhaps we already have we just cant understand it any more than we understand when she speaks to us in the wind the sound of waves on the shore well grayle said i guess he even convinced ersula who who convinced ersula roger roger adrian pushed aside his plate what does roger know he stood up wed better go do you need to use the loo or anything sky coming to the boil finger of lightning prodding languidly out of sweating clouds below several sheep already struck down a heavy tumble of bodies milkeyed heads flat to the plain a few yards away the shepherd lying dead his dog back arched howling a pitiful protest at the vengeful heavens energy the hideous energy of violent death in this painting only stonehenge was truly in its element whitened as though lit from within by electric filaments the stones exulted in the storm inside his tightening chest maiden felt he was howling like the sheepdog the print giltframed hung at the foot of the wide wooden staircase in the panelled hall at cefnybedd a phone was ringing somewhere then stopped when an answering machine collected the call maidens chest felt bruised with memory his mind rewinding at speed the lightning striking again and again revelation big lights a distant roar hospital smells he remembered the evening he walked out of elham general seeing turners painting of the angry sea around fingals cave feeling that same tightness in the chest it had not been the same image but the style the elemental rage that was the same what did it mean it meant this picture this image of stones and death had been in his tumbling dislocated dreams when andys hands were around his head and the defibrillator was smashing at his ribcage part of him came into you cindy said cindy the hasbeen endofthepier shamanic joke cindy had it right more crimes in heaven and earth cindy godalmighty was right the intensity of it all made it impossible to stand still he walked around the hall arms and legs tingling with electricity unable to pull his eyes away from the turner stones and energy and violent death its his favourite magda ring glanced at him once a flicker of uncertainty as she shed her dusty barbour on the hall floor turners stonehenge you never seen it before not on a wall maiden said im sorry i like paintings you ready to talk now letting her think it had been a deliberate ploy him appearing hypnotized by the print a digression subtle like a tv detective prettier ones in here magda led him into a large airy drawing room with a beamed ceiling and oak pillars plush armchairs set out like a hotel lounge and more stonehenge prints girtin inchbold and constables impressionistic sketch of the rainwashed megaliths with the double rainbow the sister called you in i suppose for a moment he could only think of sister andy grayle magda said listen inspector i didnt know i really didnt know she was there i didnt know she was dead im supposed to believe that detectivemode why did you dig the hole how did you know where to dig because her eyes flashed to satisfy myself it was nonsense i didnt believe it for one minute but i couldnt get it out of my head and this was the first chance i had to check it out adrian gone to his wedding roger up to town for the weekend when he goes off in his helicopter at least you can tell when hes coming back you mustve grabbed the pick before he was over the horizon perfect time im trying to tell you course starts next wednesday staff cleaners and people start arriving this afternoon get the place ready no time to waste look i had the pick ready round the back of the helicopter shed i was going to allay my own fears once and for all oh god i cant believe it its all destroyed everything we worked fors ruined magda a womans dead before they left the scene hed placed concrete slabs back in the hole covering the body you do know who it is dont you the hair magdas face puckered she tightened her jaw looked down for a moment can i get a drink course she brought whisky and tumblers from a strippedpine corner cupboard you he accepted a small one turned out to be the one which tasted of peat damp and lonely moorland meeting the sea no visible horizon it would be today sadness seeped through him he saw em as suzanne sitting opposite black hair black eyes mauve lipstick the image crucified him too much time passed and magda was standing in front of him tight black sweater jeans with a spiked leather belt pale but together sorry i said what are you magda said youre not an ordinary policeman are you no such thing as an ordinary policeman i mean not local serious crimes bureau maiden lied we he hesitated were investigating a series of murders linked to prehistoric sites whaaaat magda ring was aghast sank down involuntarily into one of the armchairs he observed her she was loosened with shock rather than relief at finally being found out there was an obvious difference look stared at him green eyes wide the colour scared out of her face again for gods sake this is nothing like this isnt murder how long have you known she was there i didnt know i keep telling you i half thought it was fantasy everybody who comes here inhabits a fantasy world it takes you over the unseen britain the spiritcountry the whole earthmysteries game its to do with romantic theories to make us feel connected so whose body is it ersula underhill i thought you knew the sister grayle sure ive spoken to grayle inspector i believed i swear to god i believed ersula had gone back to the states because of roger and then the sister shows up incognito and obviously ersula didnt go back and the sister suspects something look shouldnt you be making phone calls summoning your forensic people whoever shouldnt this place be buzzing shell come to no harm down there i want her out of here magda shuddered i want her safely stashed away in some path lab i never liked her when she was alive one of those lofty knowitall americans roger thought she was wonderful because she was so damn serious all the time tons of extra gravitas to bluff the punters brings out the worst in me though that kind of attitude that a fact look magda frowned if im going to have to watch every bloody thing i say i want my solicitor here maiden sighed ive got no witness youre not in an interview room youre not being taped and it seems unlikely to me that you killed her all right delirious magda sniffed ive got to start looking for a job it was good here for a while until it got stupid why did it get stupid she offered him more whisky he shook his head greed falling back in the chair crossing her legs the bottle on her lap always bloody greed isnt it he was the countrys most respected neolithic archaeologist honorary fellow of christ church etcetera etcetera and then he started doing tv wouldnt think it could turn the head of a guy that educated would you let me tell you theyre the worst especially someone with a libido off the richter scale whos had to worry about the career risks involved in shafting too many students now suddenly hes getting fan letters on funnysmelling paper dear professor that shot of you stripped to the waist in the roman villa just haunts me so if youve got a spare place on any of your digs id be happy to accommodate your trowel the university of the earth began as a supplyline for nonstop totty partly well the big angles money obviously roger wasnt slow to pick up on the fact that a large proportion of the people writing in to the programme were new agers and earthmysteries fanatics trying to convert him thats where the real money is people dont want digs where after six months youve uncovered some boring foundations and a few bits of pottery they want the ark of the bloody covenant so he starts to compromise the reason i know all this by the way is i was his producer at the bbc before he realized he could quadruple his income overnight by making his own programmes for channel four and i went with him naturally because who wouldnt magda looked defiant drank some whisky and no he wasnt fucking me needed me too much doesnt sleep with anybody he might need in two months time as the abrupt termination of a loving relationship often offends maiden said wryly quite which is also why he didnt sleep with her ersula woman after his own heart you see talked crap in a very learned intense way everything she said sounded like a balanced argument resulting from years of study he loved that he wanted to employ her he wanted her mind i mean on the payroll whereas this was the problem she wanted him body and mind was she all he could see was the puffedup blistered decomposing face in the concrete tomb goodlooking not goodlooking enough anyway she was throwing herself at him wheres the fun in that wheres the hunt sad like an undergraduate going for her tutor except this was a grown woman brilliant mind sexual age of twelve and she sets her sights on roger falconer save us i mean really clever woman but not clever enough to realize what a sham he was have you seen his programmes just been watching one about hunting magda nodded good example very good example thats the one where he puts the esoteric case for blood sports linked to ley lines hard to tell whether he was serious or hed just concocted it to take a poke at the new agers interestingly that same argument about he struggled to frame it hunting feeding the earth mmm it had been aired in a letter sent to this little pagan magazine some months earlier god magda said youve really hit the spot havent you how longve you been looking into all this long enough sorry cindy magdas green eyes didnt blink youre right its not his theory he got it from adrian he gets everything from adrian its almost funny i mean have you met adrian no he seems quite ludicrously harmless at first minor publicschool idiot caricature sort of chap you see in old black and white films i mean you know a hunk for heavens sake although he doesnt realize it too engrossed you can imagine him as a child collecting pictures of standing stones like other kids collected stamps magda uncrossed her legs started to uncork the whisky then changed her mind and put the bottle on the floor hes somehow not of this not of this age very polite very courtly he paid court to ersula in awe of her supervised her dreaming sessions and when she became obsessed with all that he mistakenly thought he was going to be part of the package he was pursuing her and she was pining for bloody roger i dont know how adrian didnt realize that from the outset but as i say hes not of this age poor sod belongs in jane austen you know what i mean ok maiden thought they were wandering from the point what happened to ersula vanished magda said well sort of i mean not unexpectedly is what i mean one night near the end of the summer course she was closeted with roger in his study for a long time over two hours i stayed out of the way i could guess the kind of things being said fairly selfevident when she didnt come down to breakfast next day she was due to go with roger and a group of students in a couple of minibuses he sent me over to the stables to see what was wrong with her too professional surely to let a little emotional hiccup etcetera etcetera bastard so im knocking on her door shes shouting go away leave me alone sob sob etcetera so i had to go and shepherd the idiots around when we got back it was after dark i didnt see her but the following morning shed gone suitcases everything you didnt try to find out where how could we where would we start she was american she probably went back to america to nurse her broken heart in the familys long island beach house or wherever anyway we had to see all the punters off the premises and we were all pretty knackered while you were away where was adrian she pushed both hands through her dark curly hair exasperated at her lack of perception good old adrian was otherwise engaged that day taking delivery of a few truckloads of readymix concrete for rogers new helipad oh adrians terribly practical laid it all out himself you see theres a very significant ley line in that area goes through the woods connects eventually with st marys churchyard adrian said the helicopter shouldnt come down on the ley because the earth wouldnt like it so only one edge overlaps the line dont tell me how he worked out precisely where it goes he just did and he marked it with a row of crosses raked into the surface of the concrete so wed know where the ley went and roger could avoid it when he landed magda stood up and walked to the biggest window overlooking the courtyard so naturally thats where i went to hack it up just like that listen i know the guy its what hed do the ritualistic side of him he was besotted with her hed want to put her in a place where her spirit could fly and and what and how do you think she died she obviously killed herself someone that serious that singleminded and he spurns her he says sorry old girl but youre really not my type have a drink i dont know how she did it pills or something thats for you to find out jesus the stupidity of men he waited this is roger this is the way he is i know this is what happened wasnt going to have a silly hysterical girls suicide destroying his enterprise i mean the scandal the publicity you see he has big expansion plans more landcastle farm when he gets old bacton out wants that castle so badly hes drooling a real little university so he needs every punter he can get now especially rich americans she stopped for a moment working it out she was an intelligent woman maiden thought but she was wrong and they just buried her without a thought for the relatives this is roger falconer were talking about of course he wouldnt think about the relatives and adrian would do as he was told he needs this job what about her possessions her cases theres an old forge out at the back adrian restored it last winter likes to make himself useful perhaps they burned the cases there i dont know maiden stood up i use your phone table in the hall maiden called castle farm cindy answered maiden said cindy get over here wear trousers xlii outside the morris minor spluttered indignantly marcus felt that way too he glared resentfully at the front door as the morris chugged away the bastard hadnt explained other than to say hed been summoned to cefnybedd suggesting marcus hold the bloody fort which made marcus furious because if anyone was going to tackle falconer it should have been him to make it worse lewis the smug bastard had buggered off upstairs bracelets jangling and come down five minutes later looking not entirely unlike a normal man he was going to cefnybedd to play it straight and whatever was happening there marcus bacton was being excluded on grounds of age and infirmity and the likelihood of his causing a scene no doubt bastards irritable and unsettled macus slumped back to the study amid the clutter on the desk were the cupstained maps with leys drawn in the book displaying an illustration of the green man and the edwardian photo album he opened the album at the picture of annie davies from which grayle underhill had identified her ghost annies eyes in the sepia picture looked aeons old he tried to see in them the birdlike eyes of mrs willis and couldnt if underhill hadnt reacted to that photo he would have chanced his arm with another one in colour girl in a deckchair wearing her mothers sunglasses and a very sad and knowing smile sallys last summer marcus blinked away the tears as the phone rang marcus andy anderson said listen to me dont argue all right havent the strength to argue with you anderson where are you im doesnae matter marcus you take bobby and the dog and get the hell out bloody hell just do it you may have visitors know what im saying maidens not even here ill simply tell them ive never heard of him im no talkin about the police all right yunderstand what im saying this is bad guys marcus wont take no for an answer marcus was suspicious how can you possibly know about this doesnae matter i know this is no a scam these people they wont want any witnesses that means you marcus this is very very bad guys yhear me marcus pondered a moment all right he said i get the message thank christ act on it ill call back in ten minutes time i dont expect an answer anderson hung up marcus didnt move for a whole minute he looked out of the window at the empty yard the castle ruins firm against a white sky he remembered how excited it had made him feel when he first saw it when he realized the castle came free with the house from his inside breast pocket he pulled the colour photo of his daughter in the deckchair the sunglasses with diamante frames too big for her malcolm stuck his bucket head round the door and then wandered in tail waving nonchalantly wants us to get out marcus placed the photo on top of the picture of annie very bad guys he went down on his hands and knees put his nose up to the dogs very very bad guys malcolm growled englishmans castle is his bloody castle marcus said get out for good when i sell this place and not before in the stable block maiden pushed at adrians door youre the law magda watched a little hostile now but made no attempt to stop him i suppose you can do what you like the door was made of old pine boards it wasnt even locked maiden stepped back let her go in first but i dont know what you think youre going to find she stood in the middle of the small wooden room as if she knew she was by far the most interesting item in the whole place which was true enough conditions here would have made a spartan recruit feel underpampered single wardrobe and a bed no clock no books the bed had been stripped to its boards the mattress upended against a wall maiden raised an eyebrow at magda some kind of fakir this bloke i didnt realize it had gone quite this far he spends so many nights on stones his body probably revolts against an orthodox bed or hes educated it that way more likely maiden was going through the clothes in the wardrobe shirts and trousers army trousers tweed trousers not jeans one suit he thought its a soldiers wardrobe an oldfashioned soldier whats his background smalltime countrygentry military family huntingshooting fathers a retired colonel lives near salisbury came over once nice man quiet what did he do before he came here some form of youthworker i think vso perhaps hes just a big boy scout i really dont see why youre doing this why arent you raiding rogers quarters too influential is he too well connected actually maiden said difficult though it may be for you to understand that really doesnt worry me a lot right now but if ersula was murdered she was probably murdered while you and falconer were away which leaves adrian in the frame where was he last night do you know i dont see him come and go i have a threeroom apartment in the granary across there and it has nice thick walls i mean he was around i assume messing in his workshop up at the knoll doing his evp tapes hes always around evp electronic voice phenomena recording socalled spirit voices some people claim to pick them up between stations on the radio adrian left cassette recorders in ancient sites he says you can sometimes hear voices like the yorkshire ripper heard voices thats ridiculous all right you said falconer got his ideas about hunting generating energy and feeding the earth and all that from adrian through adrian i ought to have said magda sat down on the wooden bedframe through his dreams his dreams keeps tapes of all his dreams at ancient sites hes become so practised at it now he doesnt need anyone with him wakes up promptly at the end of a dream and talks it into a recorder sometimes increasingly in fact he has you know prehistoric dreams hell dream about tribal rituals and ceremonies and sacrifices and sacrifices all kinds of things sacrifices were part of life then human sacrifices i dont know i dont listen to them i mean roger was deeply cynical at first then he began to see information and descriptions that adrian couldnt possibly have learned from books not that he ever reads he hardly ever reads anything any more and yet possibly because hes such a simple soul he seemed far more in tune with stone and bronze age thinking than roger could possibly be i dont you know think roger believes hes getting psychic messages or anything like that but the points he makes seem to gel trigger off ideas which somehow germinate into programmes theres going to be a book too on the mind of neolithic man thats an ongoing thing but you dont listen to these tapes i listened to a couple i didnt like them much why not i dont know it it was somehow like listening in to one of these sex chatlines a sort of gloating tone i didnt like it it wasnt like adrian i have to work with the guy its bad enough working for roger why do you stay because i was divorced and not too well off and now ive been able to buy a lovely town house in hay which i shall move into quite soon and because were producing some wonderful tv programmes and one day one day its it was really going to take off the university of the earth thats why we started with such an ambitious title thered be a lot of people working here not just here wed have places all over the country it wouldnt always have to be so intimate adrian ever make a move on you god no not connected enough has to be the full deepandmeaningful for adrian and not deep and meaningful necessarily in the way youd expect until ersula i dont recall adrian ever showing much interest in women some of the students were very interested but hes always the gentleman i sometimes thought this is strange that he was more attracted i mean in an almost erotic way to the earth his idea of the earth a sharp soily smell stabbed at maidens senses and he wanted to run out into the fresh air and keep on running where does he keep his tapes he asked her in the mirror in the pubs ladies room grayle saw herself really saw herself for the first time in what seemed like months she was shocked tried to flatten down the bunches of hair jesus this wasnt a grown womans hair this was goddamn teenage hair didnt go too well with the puffy eyes and the lines lines were those lines back home there werent lines there were never lines back home see the hard lights in these british bathrooms seemed designed to condition you to the idea of your own mortality youll die the light on your face said sooner than you can imagine im out of here grayle said aloud she wouldnt spend too long at the wedding tonight shed check into a good hotel where the rooms had phones shed take a long hot shower then spend a small fortune calling home call her dad who for all she knew had news of ersula call lyndon mcaffrey maybe she could get a new column someplace and one thing was sure it would be a different kind of column it would deal with the same stuff but this time it would be responsible it would recognize this was serious stuff stuff that could screw up a person in a big way adrian was waiting out in the parking lot beyond him fields of light green cottages and barns of golden stone under the whitewashed october sky super he said asshole she looked into his bland smiling face and saw the other face the face with meat fibres in its teeth dreamjunkie fanatic he was immature this was the problem he hadnt learned how to live in the real world jesus here was holy grayle thinking this what should we do then adrian looking at her across the car chin resting on folded arms on the red roof should we go straight to the stones and acclimatize ourselves or join the others in chipping norton maybe i need to change my clothes i oughta check out what the others are wearing ok youre the driver chipping norton it is when they were on the road he said i say look im sorry for getting so preachy oh well i uh it was all fascinating stuff adrian really i get sort of carried away its enthusiasm is all people today uh not enough people have enthusiasm its become a very bored society do you think so sure folks just staring at the tube for hours listening to the same old guns n roses albums whats that its a band adrian oh you arent into music adrian considered this its unnecessary it diverts us stops us listening to natural sounds if we pollute our ears with music we cant hear the earth breathe my father listened to mozart all the time when he was at home blaring through the house you couldnt think worse now hes retired believes he needs to educate himself on the finer things of life what does your father do hes uh hes an academic at harvard didnt ersula talk about him ever to roger i expect yeah well ersula can be kind of hurtful sometimes she doesnt mean to be that way shes just a little impatient of uh people who werent as brainy as she was i guess im sorry this included me too to ersula i was just just crazy grayle and shes younger than me brains arent everything she needed to find her spiritual side she knew that she did recognize that i could help her in that direction she did thought at first that she could get what she needed from roger but i showed her how wrong she was how utterly wrong how did you do thathey whats wrong here im losing whats wrong with the car loss of power keening noise dont rev it like that pull in pull in here whats that noise mean better switch off adrian opened his door do you know how to loosen the bonnet huh to get at the engine you wanna look under the hood you know what youre doing im a practical sort of chap adrian said they came back out the front way as maiden followed magda towards the small gothic door in the side wall a venerable morris minor creaked into the forecourt who on earth is this magda said strained ill get rid of them dont do that it looks like the local cid chief it was er politic to bring him in case like this the local guys need to be seen holding your hand in that thing you never watched columbo magda afternoon sir cindy strode towards them strode he was wearing slacks and a blazer and something that might have been an old school tie his hair was slicked back the mauve area so faint it might have been an effect of the light this is detective superintendent lewis maiden said very slowly and clearly sir this is ms ring shes in charge here in the absence of professor falconer how are you cindy turned to maiden his voice had deepened and seemed to have acquired a coarse london accent sincerely hope this isnt a waste of my time sunshine got an armed blag in hereford on me plate already this morning plus a floater in the wye maiden said to magda would you excuse us a moment cindy followed him into a corner of the forecourt under trees not overdoing it am i bobby played a detective in the sweeney in the seventies shot dead before the first commercials and not a minute too soon maiden said bitterly i shall temper my performance good of you to make me your superior bobby it was your age listen were going to hear some audiotapes of ancientsite dreams recorded by one adrian fraserhale if they answer any of your green man questions try not to show it you might also have to look at a body oh dear god an american woman ersula underhill grayles sister cindy closed his eyes briefly i wish i could say i was surprised she was killed and buried inside the concrete helipad round the back cindy winced on a ley line maiden said as it happens yes cindy said heavily and the smell no i dont suppose the smells are stronger as much as the air itself is cleaner and keener one can smell smoke from oh miles away one can see in the air all around a rainbow of colours although far more than a rainbow and each colour is represented by a smell the auras from different kinds of vegetation and wildlife and stones rocks the rocks are very much alive theres distant smoke and blood the blood is the keenest sharpest smell of all and its coming from i think its a chicken or something killed by a fox i expect are they all like this cindy said more or less magda ring flipped the tape out of the machine there were scores of cassettes on metal shelves above the tape decks in the portakabin the spine of each plastic box had a reference number bobby had stopped talking as soon as the voice began and he hadnt spoken since something was disturbing him the poor dab probably could not identify it although hed be closer after last night much closer it was not a particularly dramatic voice educated to a point certainly well brought up amiable but bland in itself there was a zest here but it seemed relatively innocent the enthusiasm of a trainspotter but still the voice of the gloucester massmurderer frederick west was apparently matteroffact and almost jovial about his murders certainly a man with a mission cindy said it gets incredibly boring after a while said magda ring a rather beautiful woman if somewhat sullen feeling slighted perhaps that this adrian seemed oblivious of her charms and oblivious he would be if he was the green man if where does he sleep in a room above the stable bobby blinked as if waking up on bare boards ive checked it out nothing nowhere else he doesnt have much baggage magda said travels light roger admires that the itinerant huntergatherer theres his land rover worth a look i suppose oh and the forge he restored an old blacksmiths forge nobody else goes in there lets see it cindy held open the door for her she led them to a building very much on its own part concealed by laurels and leylandii a squarish stone building with a chimney and castlelike slits for windows a castiron bar ran the length of each slit a rough thick door of oak had no handle only a large keyhole cindy pushed it it didnt move well maiden what do you suggest here magda said dont you people need a warrant for this with a womans body out there cindy said menacingly do you really think it would take us long to get one lets not waste time kick it in maiden but the door resisted the flat of bobbys foot all right ill get you a crowbar magda said dully as if she also knew that this was the place they found the tapes behind some loose bricks at the back of the forge itself maiden thought they wouldnt have found them at all if one of the bricks hadnt been left half out as if it had been replaced in a rush the cassette cases were numbered one to six in roman numerals except for one which had been placed on top of the others in the cavity so hes been here recently so it appears bobby cindy opened the unnumbered cassette case it was empty safe to handle these fingerprints if its his voice on the tapes well hardly need prints sir quite maiden just testing cindy gathered up the tapes maiden looked around there were cinders in the forge whats he do here against the wall opposite the door was a small lathe metal shavings on the cobblestone floor an acrid tang in the air turn his hand to anything magda said made those bars for the window slits for instance as i said roger loves this in him his selfsufficiency he do much hunting maiden said he goes out with the local hunt sometimes and i believe he belongs to a gun club in hereford a gun theres a cabinet in the house a couple of twelvebores in there roger goes with him sometimes roger says hes just an extremely balanced person which is why hes so affable most of the time no stress roger says a simple man we all have a lot to learn from adrian i suppose cindy picked up a strip of black metal if hes so practical he could manufacture such a thing as a crossbow how long did you say he had been here just under two years ah not relevant then shall we play these back in the portakabin cindy took out the cassette marked i handed it to magda maiden discovered his mouth was dry magda put the tape into the machine a swishing sound issued from the speakers rain cindy said the voice began hesitant at first but a certain swelling excitement beneath it the voice was distorted and tinny noone can see me i feel almost invisible a part of of everything so utterly relaxed so fused ive never felt like this before i there was a squeak wind that back again maiden said its different its not the same machine you hear that thats one of those little hand recorders the squeak is when he pushes the pause button id guess this is not the kind of gear youd use on the dream project we use marantz or sony prowalkman with a microphone with a windshield no windshield on this you can hear the wind banging against it which suggests said cindy that when he made this particular tape he didnt have access to the equipment here maybe the original was on a minicassette and he transferred it roll it magda the rain noise again but when the voice came back it was stronger as the tape continued it became more confident more fluent more insistent he is invisible in the greenery the green man the very oldest guardian of the earth whose face one sees carved in stone above church doorways his hair luxuriant with leaves the leaves bearing fruit stone nuts and stone berries more leaves sprouting whole from the grinning mouth foliage gripped between stone teeth the grin that says i am the earth there was a crash cindy had slumped against the metal shelves collapsing one its all right he picked himself up dont mind me slipped clumsy its all right maiden nobody spoke until the crackly distorted tape was over the speakers hummed magda made no move to remove the cassette her hands were squeezed tight together it her voice cracked she coughed it doesnt sound like a dream it wasnt cindy said i can assure you of that christ thats why you asked if he could make a crossbow play the last bit again maiden said broken the convention and wasnt it easy his first kill his first human kill cindy said the convention the convention magda said excuse me and went out into the yard they heard the slap of vomit she dug up ersulas body this morning maiden said shes seen what he can do ah me cindy took out the cassette tape held it up between two fingers and dropped it in the box as if it was radioactive can you imagine anyone more despicable and like all of them like all serial killers he doesnt believe hes doing anything wrong hes broken a convention hes feeling alive for the first time the cunt no me i meant i wanted so much to believe it i wanted to be proved right can you imagine anyone more contemptible than that shut up cindy if it hadnt been for you maria i knew that girl so well she could talk to me damn if i was any kind of shaman i should have seen the danger should have been able to warn her im no bloody shaman bobby cindy this was random in its way he just wanted a hunt saboteur someone he believed the earth would be better off without he thought it might be difficult so itd be better starting off with someone he expected not to like it could have been any one of them and it wasnt difficult at all in the end was it lovely wasnt it easy he says wasnt it easy maiden walked to the door he could see magda ring with her back to the perimeter wall gazing nowhere what i find disturbing is the way he starts off saying i and then he switches off the recorder we dont know how long hes sitting there could be a few seconds could be an hour longer but when he switches back on hes become he hes created this character the green man he hasnt created him he exists hes an ancient archetype almost a god our friend adrian is taking on his magic his charisma his voice changes hes immediately stronger more fluent he tells the story without hesitation with an absolute belief in himself and his mission a refuge too he can slip into the persona of the green man whenever whenever its called for this man is unbelievably dangerous do we know where he is now bobby could he i mean come back any time not imminently gone apparently to a wedding cindy froze xliii magda ring was up against the wall cindy practically shaking her where is he how long ago did he leave whose wedding is it come on girl bobby maiden pulled him away cindy this guy performs quietly he isnt going to do it at a bloody wedding you dont understand cindy whirled on him little grayle grayle underhill was going to a wedding you might believe in coincidences bobby but in my world they dont exist wheres the wedding my love whats happened to his accent magda looking scared by now began to slide away from cindy along the wall whys he gone welsh you two you arent police at all are you i am maiden said i promise you ill show you i dont want to see your damned card again i want to know what the hells going on all right look maiden held up one hand this guys a friend contact of marcus bactons hes suspected for some time that several murders in various parts of the country were down to one man and the police didnt want to listen ive been listening end of story wheres the wedding my love cindy said insistently which nice old prereformationchurchonanalignment are we talking about its not a church its some sort of new age nuptial thing its at the rollright stones in oxfordshire oh my christ janny oates matthew lyall theyre the couple i dont know where they live theyll be on our books if you can wait they did a course here which is where adrian how long ago did he leave couple of hours three hours i dont know he didnt take his land rover rushed in this morning grabbed some things said he had a lift we cant wait cindy rocked tearing at his face with his fingers bobby were going were going now what about the rest of the tapes listen to them in the car cindy began to run across the courtyard pulling car keys from his blazer pocket shouting back over his shoulder shes given him a lift bobby shes got this psychopath in her car youre not leaving me here magda clutched at maidens jacket not with that bloody open grave do you have a car she nodded frantically all sophistication abandoned anywhere you can go people in hay my new house do it dont speak to anyone about this especially the police no listen give me a phone number if you dont hear from us by say seven tonight call the police yourself tell them everything tell them where to find ersulas grave tell them tell them di maiden bobby maiden the morris minor was clattering towards them its passenger door flapping open magda grabbed his wrist pen he found a chewedoff bic in his pocket she scribbled a phone number on the back of his hand she said her sister was in a i think she said dislocated state when she met some people at the rollright stones theyre nice she said the people not the stones i remember that cindy swung the car between the trees into the drive almost scraping a land rover parked under a willow trees browning umbrella you need to know about the rollrights bobby i shall a memory had kicked maiden in the head at the sight of the land rover he was in another passenger seat a woman in a blond wig driving cindy stop let me out half a minute the land rovers doors were unlocked maiden jumped in rummaged around ordnance survey maps a thick paperback guide to stone circles of the british isles much thumbed a hand lamp pair of wellingtons and he found the recorder wrapped in sacking underneath the drivers seat a cassette inside it half wound he slipped the cassette out took it back to the morris ah cindy pulling sluggishly away before the passenger door was shut rather hoping i was that you wouldnt find that one how do you know whats on it i think that he wouldnt be able to rest would not be free of the green man until it was done out of his system the other one he recorded in the rain before he left the scene presumably sure maiden said quietly its also occurred to me why he may have done this how it came about why he killed em perhaps you wont need to hear it then put it on maiden said when the green man started speaking it was deliberate unhurried a voice full of an awful calm precise relentless certainty the energy at black knoll is having a most interesting effect on the woman she is clearly reluctant to enter the precincts of the burial chamber she stands there her unruly blond hair pushed down by a cap and by the rain and then all at once she cries out oh come on youre fucking crazy she begins to sob standing on the knoll soaking wet and sobbing before at last going to sit on one of the flat stones in the short avenue approaching the chamber itself the stones amplify her thoughts so that the green man lying snugly invisibly betwen two gorse bushes knows at once that she is crying out for release its really quite astonishing she has walked the line precisely from the clearing from stile to stile the old sacrificial path she has walked through the darkening rain this woman who has crossed an ocean to present herself to the earth and to the green man her servant her lover the woman whispers ersula and rises screaming ersula into the rain it is all that the green man can do to restrain himself from leaping to his feet in euphoria at this joyful union across the veil a union which cries out to be complete how then should he facilitate the completion of the union with his hands around the tender flesh of her throat yes she is begging now for deliverance her hands are clasped she is swaying her breath coming faster in great gulps the green man feels his fingers pulse he begins to rise from the bracken in his majesty and then all at once she rears up her arms wide oh god she whispers oh god and then turns and runs away taking the castle line looking over her shoulder once as if to say follow me follow me oh grayle cindy whispered the voice broke off and there was only the sound of breathing in the night this is when she saw whatever she saw maiden said and then came running down to the castle looking shattered though not as shattered as perhaps she would have been if she had known how close she had come to death it is dusk when the green man returns to the castle in his vehicle this time driving into a field and parking without lights behind a hedge almost opposite the entrance when the woman was taken into the house earlier he was baffled was it to be done here and what of the man him too it occurred to him that now in the absence of the old witch the castle would at last be fully open to him cindy stopped the tape mrs willis you see he could not have killed with mrs willis present and now shes dead he demonizes her he calls her a witch why why couldnt he with her around he perceived too much power around her too much light i dont know but you said he killed her and now i am unsure we do know that he drew her out in the only way that would work he approached her and asked her for healing the one thing mrs willis could not deny him this gift she believed she had received from the holy mother at high knoll she could never refuse healing see couldnt refuse at least to try thus are saints martyred this is getting too apocalyptic for me cindy cindy didnt reply but put on the tape again and when he returns at dusk he knows the identity of the woman full circle he has realized everything is for a purpose that it must be done in the knowledge of who she is and why she is here sent yes but what if she is no longer here he does not even know where she is sleeping you fool he tells himself have you no faith and as he is telling himself this a car turns into the castle gateway the green man alights silently and follows on foot waiting in deepest shadows under the castle walls he sees a man leave the house and get into the car as the door opens the interior light identifies the woman and before the car emerges from the castle gates the green man is back in his own vehicle searching without lights for the field entrance this time maiden switched off he thought it was grayle he thought emma was grayle because of the blond wig and he was locked into it by then cindy said it was ordained from the moment he saw her on the knoll he knew what he was going to do he nearly ran into the back of us once em slammed on the brakes and this land rover nearly went in the ditch and yet didnt protest no hornblowing nothing i should have known how could you possibly have known they were off the singletrack roads now passing stone farms paddocks can you go any faster maiden said its a new experience for him he does not normally use the modern roads which brashly thrust across the old straight ways he wonders occasionally now if this is right and tells himself to have faith and his faith is amply repaid when they leave the road and enter a wooded enclosure whose antiquity is immediately apparent to the green man he does not need his map he knows from the contours of the landscape and the ancient sanctity of this area between the black mountains and the brecon beacons here rise some of the tallest and finest standing stones in the land he is at once at home his spirit burns it is an inn the sign says open to nonresidents he is gratified to note that his is not the only allterrain vehicle in the car park through a groundfloor window he can see into the bar which is quite full of people who from their clothes he can tell are mainly local he does not see the woman there he must be careful not to bump into her she will recognize him at once but he is beginning to feel secure and protected he enters the bar speaks to noone passes through to the toilets and then to the reception area it seems that they are staying the night theres noone at the reception desk which is fortunate the keys to the rooms are on a board on the wall three are missing rooms two five and ten there is noone to see him as he casually ascends the stairs on the first landing he tries doors only one room is accessible room seven at the very end which has no lock or handle only a freshly drilled hole his footstep echoes in an unfurnished room there is a smell of sawdust he switches on the light to discover that room seven is presently undergoing refurbishment there are scattered tools and heaps of plaster and some paintstained overalls he hears voices from the landing and creeps back to the door because of the age of the house the passage is narrow and the two people are in single file walking away from him towards the stairs the woman obscured by the man whose back is turned to the green man until he half turns to make sure he has locked the door of room five and the green man recognizes him at once from castle farm hes probably the nephew of marcus bacton and he poses a slight problem for the green mans human quarries to date have all been hunted singly well no hurry theyre obviously going for dinner now that he knows the green man emerges and takes a leisurely look around the upper rooms of this pleasant old house he finds two ugly metal fire escapes geomantically disastrous for such a building but obviously useful to him tonight in fact he uses one to effect his exit wedging the door open just a slit using a chisel he has found in room seven who knows the chisel may be useful later at the bottom of the fire escape he finds himself in nearcomplete darkness amid trees and bushes but when he emerges onto a lawned area the moon emerges too from behind a cloud and he can see the lie of the land as far as the mass of the mountain called sugar loaf he walks round the perimeter of the building and arrives on the other side of the fire escape where he discovers a narrow path leading through bushes to higher ground a mound in fact a distinct mound elation blossoms like a golden flower in the green mans groin not yet the mound is flattopped a tumulus surely a holy place a small area has been dug where some fool has attempted to plant flowers the green man sits on the mound in meditation for some time perhaps hours he sleeps the moon is in his eyes in his dream the moon becomes a druids shining sickle he awakes and for a moment it seems that the moon is finely rimmed with blood when he comes to his feet and stretches he is cold but braced and certain in his mind at last the earth calls to him he removes his clothes he stands in his majesty atop the holy mound lifts his arms to the shadow of the sugar loaf he is not at all cold now he feels the flow of energy through the land he knows instinctively that this is a crossing point the earth calls again to him and he lies down upon the area of attempted cultivation and he penetrates her am i getting this right cindy this guy fucks flowerbeds and probably rubs damp soil into his skin cindy didnt look at him and eats it of course he sees the earth as his lover he wants to be a part of her and her of him in her in him think about it but resist at all times any temptation to regard this man as ludicrous unlikely bobby maiden said grimly and thought about it thought the unthinkable about the smell and the taste of the grave about the smell and the taste as he lay with em and his reaction to it it made him want to put his shoulder against the car door and hurl himself into the road calm yourself bobby what are the chances he said tautly of him being impotent with women considerable i would say and what magda says about him being besotted with ersula underhill do you think he was perhaps more besotted with the idea of getting close to someone he knew he was ultimately going to kill cindy waited to pull onto the main road that would take them into the city of hereford maiden pushed in the cassette returning by the fire escape fully dressed of course he enters room seven he sees it with new eyes at one end of the room lies a roll of carpet and the retractable knife used to cut it in a cleaners cupboard in the bathroom he has found a pair of ladies rubber gloves which he somehow manages to stretch over his hands he dons the paintsplashed overalls which also are a little tight but not too much of a problem he waits in room seven but not for long he knows he must act before the earthenergy dissipates in this filthy secondhand atmosphere this centralheating smog rage takes him a sort of internal thunderstorm his fingers tense and tremble not tremble vibrate his fingers vibrate he picks up the retractable carpet knife and pushes out its steel blade unfortunately it protrudes less than an inch hardly a druidic sickle impatient now he gets down on his hands and knees and scrabbles around until he finds a screwdriver and he takes the thing apart empties the spare blades on the floor he examines them one is longer than the rest and has a curved end a sort of hook thing it is previously unused and when he tests it with his gloved thumb it slices cleanly through the rubber he rises very well he will release both spirits the earth has decreed it he will open the window immediately afterwards so that even if the blood cannot soak into her its essence will be carried into the night air he wrenches open the door of room seven and almost simultaneously another door opens the lighting in the passage is dim but if bactons nephew had glanced to his left there would have been enough light for him to see the green man in his majesty and all would have been ruined but the earth is with him tonight the nephew with a bundle of clothes under his arm walks directly to the bathroom the green man steps back into room seven and waits to see what will happen in a short time the nephew emerges half dressed and walks with his head bowed towards the stairs it is the sign the green man moves into the passage flicks out the short curved blade like the moon another sign and walks to the door of room five only then does it occur to him that these doors selflock from the inside oh he thinks he should never have come here his is an outdoor pursuit but even as hes thinking these defeatist thoughts he notices that the door is not fully closed a garment has been inserted around the catch of the lock to prevent it engaging presumably to facilitate her lovers return the woman has enclosed the lock in the cup of her brassiere the green m click i think thats enough cindy said take out the cassette lock it in the glove compartment it represents your freedom lock it away dont think of personal revenge think what what a fine girl she was cry for her and then put it behind you and clear your mind for what is to come do you hear me bobby he couldnt see bobbys face for his hands cindy pulled alongside a phone box im going to phone marcus put him in the picture there was no reply at castle farm gone for a walk perhaps to think things out when he returned to the driving seat bobby looked composed again for now xliv the circle was looking even more chewed up today as if the stones had some degenerative disease or maybe once again it was just the way she was feeling limestone the reverend charlie said this is what happens with limestone theyll still be here in another two thousand years count on it he didnt look a lot like a reverend he had on this really old fringed leather jacket and frayed offwhite jeans and sneakers with a hole in one toe through which you could see he wasnt wearing socks the sky had cleared now late afternoon or maybe this was a different climate zone or something in the east purplish clouds were forming like a mountain and the sun had a dull dirty sheen going to rain at some stage charlie had a mild london accent nothing surer always rains at my weddings he grinned showing teeth that were uneven chipped and brownish a lot like the rollright stones in fact grayle had come out here ahead of the party because charlie had to come get his stuff together shed gotten talking to him told him about ersula and he seemed like a nice guy and hed offered her a ride over in his van shed explained to him what had happened how the hire car had broken down and adrian couldnt fix it but said hed run back to the pub and call up the aa and when he returned it was in a car with this couple who were headed for chipping norton made sense adrian said if she went along with these people and hed stay and wait for the aa who sometimes took simply for ever and hed bring the car along to the stones once it was fixed on the one hand grayle didnt like to leave the hire car on the other shed had enough for one day of adrian and his lectures and it was kind of him so shed unloaded her case and gone with the people in the car and adrian had stayed with the rover and his cricket bag in the hotel in chipping norton not surprisingly there was no sign of matthew or janny and grayle obviously didnt know any other guests which was how shed homed in on the individual with the dog collar you conducted weddings here before charlie actually no the reverend massaged one of the taller stones with both hands weddings here tend to be of the pagan variety handfastings that sort of thing im here by way of a compromise friend of the family and also just about the only ordained clergyman they could find willing to conduct an openair wedding in a place this notorious the last tourists two spinsterish ladies in golfingtype checked trousers walked out of the circle and didnt look back grayle said notorious been some fairly unpleasant goingson at the old rollrights over the centuries charlie leaned against the stone well over this century particularly its because its so relatively accessible from oxford and london what kind of goingson oh you know satanic rites sicko stuff for instance a spaniel was sacrificed here some years ago thats awful what kind of people would do that noone id care to break bread with grayle but these are difficult desperate times everyone searching for a quick cutprice spiritual fix could you help me with my altar charlies altar was a small wooden picnic table they set it up at the far end of the circle where the pine trees reared it looked flimsy and lonely you have your church hereabouts charlie dont have a church at all im a sort of embarrassing anglican mendicant travel around begging for scraps wedding here twoweek locum post there few rock festivals in the summer theyre great sunday morning worship surprising how many crawl out of their tents for it even if theyre too stoned to read the hymn sheets no poor as the proverbial but then so was jc charlie took out a tin box placed it on the altar and began to roll himself a cigarette grayle said you think these are uh bad places generally course not terrific places some of them wild and spectacular like castlerigg in the lake district aweinspiring like avebury just not awfully sure about this one feels polluted somehow but then these are the places we should be bringing a little light down on dont you think you think they still have power absolutely why else would we have built most of our churches on the same sites you can feel it while youre working you really can when you stand in front of the altar in some tiny little country church and raise your arms vroom and maybe you see things charlies eyes narrowed he looked her up and down after inspecting the other guests at the hotel in chipping norton nothing formal but lots of floaty stuff shed changed in the ladies room into a long print skirt and a scoopneck blouse thrown a woollen wrap around her shoulders what sort of things charlie said suspiciously kind of unexplained phenomena things she pulled on the tassels of her wrap i think i may be a little crazy the reverend charlie invited her to sit on his altar with him offered a cigarette good stuff only the best from a man of god grayle blinked uh not right now thanks he nodded you know grayle its an odd thing but i never saw a ghost problem with ghosts and i believe in them sure they never seem to appear to people who really want to see one strange eh oh i always wanted to see one back home when i had this new age newspaper column but when i came over here to find ersula when i was really alone in a strange place no i did not want to see anything i couldnt explain grayle sighed and found herself secondarysmoking the reverends dope andy had dozed for a couple of hours on the sofa woke up feeling lousy and gave herself some reiki called marcus back wouldnt put it past the old sod to stay away a couple of hours and then return too meek come to think of it the way hed accepted the idea of danger but no answer from castle farm so she made herself some soup and got ready for work having agreed to call in on tony parker on the way dispense more laying on of hands shed asked him could he not just call them off these bad guys if somebody sent them tony parker had said if hypothetically and from my limited knowledge of such matters some operatives had been contracted then the hirer would not expect to hear from them again until completion of the contract thats the way of it as i understand it ill leave you to your grief then his colour was improved no question of that jesus god andy thought the things we wind up doing well sister whatever it was i appreciate it parker had said as she stood up and that offer stands had to admit shed never treated anybody or at least any man more receptive mostly they were a wee bit nervous or trying too hard tony parker both emotionally drained and entirely confident that nobody would mess with him in his own office had submitted totally and so had realized immediate and immense benefit better than pills clearly and no sideeffects so he wanted more and he thought he could buy it you flatter me tony only private nursings no my thing i prefer to put it about you know youll come around and we didnt have no conversation mind suspicious now wondering if the treatment hadnt been some form of hypnosis to promote indiscretion no andy had said we didnt listen ill come back tonight on my way to work see how yare hed brightened at that she pitied him a hardlooking young guy had peeked in on them earlier parker would be surrounded with people like this and the older he got the less hed be able to trust them half of him would have wanted to bring smart em into the family business the other half to keep her the hell away from it sister hed said as she left i aint decided whether i believe what you say about maiden but ill do what i can to suspend things meantime just that other parties got to be consulted this didnt entirely make sense who riggs shed ask him about it again after giving him another treatment she was out of her depth felt useless needed to be handson again parking the car on a payanddisplay up the street from parkers club she contemplated ringing in sick and driving down to st marys like shed go to work as normal park at the hospital vanish into the building then out through the ambulance doors and away to the border shed know if they were tailing her wouldnt she mr parker please she told the girl in the office next to the biarritz club it was five pm she could spare him half an hour i have an appointment the receptionist looked at her with recognition youre a bit late sister she said without much feeling either way mr parker collapsed at his desk this afternoon weve just heard from the general he died a short time ago andy just stood there and her healing hands felt like dead meat he hadnt been a well man anyway the receptionist said but youd know that cindy pulled out tape iii switched off lets give it a rest maiden had no argument with that it was starting to make him feel sick tape iii recounted a killing even cindy hadnt discovered in the papers victim was a seventyyearold church verger near worcester his skull smashed on the edge of the twelfthcentury stone font the green man had learned in a dream that the medieval font had begun its working life as a druidic sacrificial stone seems to me cindy that his dreams have become increasingly literal yes i had noticed does this happen much in your experience where you actually dream about the place youre sleeping oh yes sitespecific imagery is quite common you also have an increasing number of lucid dreams that is dreams where you know you are dreaming and then you might gradually learn to control your dreams which is when it gets complicated where is the borderline between a dream and a selfinduced fantasy so he could be dreaming what he wants to dream or convincing himself when he wakes up that his dream was significant to whatever nastiness hes got in mind what im really asking is what effect is the sleeping on powerful energy points nodes energy nodes whatever what effect is that going to have on the mind of a psychopath cindy urged the grumbling morris minor past a tractor and trailer thats an interesting point bobby and a most disturbing one if we go back see to the first killing poor maria in the new forest youll recall hes operating almost instinctively in killing maria hes attempting to please the earth to get in tune but hes a little frustrated that he cant have confirmation he says something like if only there was a way of speaking directly to the earth and listening to her instructions so when he hears about this dreaming experiment which began as i recall in the eighties with an earthmysteries group called the dragon project trust if he read about this he would try it for himself its a free country you can spend a night at virtually any prehistoric site you like except stonehenge he would believe he had found it a channel of communication with the earth itself and then when he goes to work for falconer he introduces the idea which became very popular among the punters maybe he thinks theyre all going to start god forbid no i think i think he believes they will be educated by the earth the university of the earth into accepting the old ways seeing how hes already influenced the great falconer which i doubt the good professor would admit under torture no i dont think he believes they will all become serial killers he believes that to be a great honour he is a chosen instrument one of the elect you notice how he refers to himself the green man in his glory in his majesty exactly its not untypical cindy ive never heard of a modest unassuming serialkiller delusions of superiority uniqueness maiden leaned back as far as the seat would allow which wasnt far he breathed out i think this is called assembling a psychological profile is it not bobby yeah though what good its going to do how far now tewkesbury and then the back road into the cotswolds to stow say an hour and then what what do we do when we get there for a while hed felt like a copper again the big jigsaw interlocking in his head yet the more he heard of the green man tapes the less he felt up to it killers on this scale had absorbed cid teams from four five divisions heavy uniform backup incident rooms the works a damaged di with a personal angle and an ageing actorventriloquist with dubious shamanic powers in a thirtyyearold morris minor for which sixty mph was a distant memory we find grayle cindy said soberly if its not too late i wonder what the bastards reaction was when he found out hed killed the wrong woman bobby cindy said after the initial shock i doubt if hed consider your poor friend to have been the wrong woman after all for him everything is ordained collen hall on its energy node however would he have been led to this magical place otherwise in the end the identity of the victim is not important he believes the earth will choose this is underlined for him by the killing at avebury when he discovers his victim is a hairdresser thus providing a link with the famous medieval barbersurgeon whose skeleton was found beneath one of the stones after presumably trying to damage it a reverberation through the ages vindication you notice how although he might know his victim ersula grayle as soon as he sets out to kill them as soon as they become the quarry he depersonalizes them they become the woman like the fox the pheasant hes not a murderer hes just a hunter not just a hunter bobby cindy im going to have this cunt of course you are lovely of course you are marcus made himself a cheese sandwich and shut malcolm in the kitchen with a bowl of water and four bonios to keep him quiet he was a good dog a brave dog but very very bad guys stay marcus said he went out of the house and prowled the tumbledown buildings in search of weapons the best he could find was the head of a scythe which he couldnt hold without it biting into his hand and a woodenhandled pitchfork with rusted tines so badly eroded in fact that it was hard to tell if there was actually any metal beneath the rust marcus straightened his bow tie and climbed over a short broken wall to the remains of the only serviceable tower the highest part of the castle it was no more than about half of a sundered tower in the remains of the curtain wall possibly part of a gateway perhaps thered been a portcullis here could have used one now all right marcus climbed a treacherously narrow dangerously worn spiral staircase inside the tower hadnt done this in years bloody steps would be beyond repair soon he turned a corner and came out in the sky always a surprise the way the steps simply ended broke off a sycamore tree had grown up next to the tower partly obscuring the view in high summer but there was still quite an extensive vista of the black mountains for once living ominously up to their name filling the western horizon like the massed tents of a dark army once raiders had come down from the mountains from the poorer country into the lushness of the golden valley the reason the castle had been built but now the threat presumably was from the east the only way to reach this place was by road from st marys from the tower the road was visible for nearly half a mile before it dipped between the high hedges and the hills marcus sat on the top step adjusted his glasses and unwrapped his sandwich might as well go out on a full stomach joking of course maiden and his urban thugs and his bent coppers nothing would happen the jagged walls of the castle sawed into a sky of sickly yellow like tallow xlv this was the tape cindy had found himself dreading the most ersula underhill theyd been playing them at random realizing that with perhaps six hours of fraserhales boastful ramblings there wasnt going to be time to hear all of it before they reached rollright snatching out a cassette if it didnt appear to be going anywhere opening another ersulas was as hed feared the worst death of all worse than maria worse than emma curtis that would have been terrifying for her but it would also have been relatively quick he was in a hurry that night frantic almost with ersula hed had time to plan when he goes to find the woman he has already prepared her tomb and she is prepared for it shes weary of her life and its limitations her dreams have shown her better she has found a fulfilment in sleep in sacred sleep and dreams surpassing in their intensity all her waking achievements which in the superficial world of scholarship and academe have been considerable but such socalled learning lies passed from book to book is nothing a waste of life even falconer admits this now as a follower of the green man falconer is a weak man with no original thoughts she is his superior but he has betrayed her and she turns at last to the green man when he enters her room at dusk she is crying and bitter she asks the green man to lie with her on the tape an owl hooted wheres he recorded this one do you think bobby maiden hit the stop button same place as all the later ones when i tire of his mockheroic ramblings i study the background you notice that although its obviously exterior as shown by noises like that owl theres also a hollow sound a vaultlike sound we should have realized its high knoll itself he wouldnt fit inside his tape recorder would and his head and chest i think hes lying in the entrance so proud of this he is that hes giving his voice some resonance making sure the earth hears telling it in her temple and hes letting the chamber absorb it too stone records see thinking maybe that one day some evp enthusiast will capture remnants of the green man himself that it imprinting his lifes work upon the great earthmemory been missing the obvious we have the final link we hear him talking about a place we assume thats where he is but he isnt the knoll has become his psychic confessional hes been bringing as much as he can back to the knoll storing it all there abomination upon abomination like a database if you like and also restoring a tradition which he sees as having been damaged by the holy vision of annie davies its become a vaguely acknowledged healing place which he would see as feeble and womanly it needs to be reinstated as black knoll now lets hypothesize bobby that he was dictating to the stones a chapter of his memoirs say this very chapter on the night of your death he sleeps at the knoll on the knoll laying himself out like those corpses of criminals night after night he dreams of the time when it was a sacrificial stone a hunters stone his dreams are running with blood and steaming with putrescence and by now see hes developed a certain amount of control hes conditioning his dreams and at the same time consciously feeding into the knoll his accounts of such blood and darkness as it has not known in many centuries this all this the foul contents of the tapes is the black light perceived by mrs willis this happens bobby dont look unconvinced these places have been for thousands of years the receptors of the earth she disgusts him once he was attracted to her to the power of her spirit the intensity of her longing to know but now as she lolls about on the edge of her bed with her skirt plucked up to her thighs he sees that underneath shes little more than the rest of modern womanhood flawed and weak and unstable a prey to lower desires she has been drinking there is a brandy bottle on the dresser three quarters of its contents consumed she can hardly stay upright shes repulsive a disgusting mess you want me she says i know you want me youve wanted me from the start so go ahead have me and yes he thinks yes i will have you in spite of it all ill help you ill free that deep and questing soul from the squalid desires of the shell ill free it to rise up and pursue its finer goals ill make some tea he tells her she giggles how profoundly goddamn english of you im proud to be english well listen to you yes you should the green man puts the kettle on the electric ring she giggles and lies back on the bed her eyes closed and her skirt ridden up the green man turns away in revulsion from a pocket he takes a screw of paper containing the mixture he has prepared including the sedative herbs from the healthfood shop in hereford and the psilocybin mushrooms he has picked at the foot of black knoll when the herbal tea is made he sits on the bed and lifts her up to drink it tolerating her sweating face against his shoulder she grimaces he tells her it will help her soon she is rambling she insists that the knoll is a place of utter profound evil talking nonsense magic mushrooms britains best natural hallucinogen used by generations of witches magic mushroom tea with god knows what else in it after all that drink a more merciful death than any of the others got its not over yet bobby im very much afraid grayle oh hi gosh im delighted you came matthew lyall to her surprise wore a morning suit with tails traditional english wedding outfit ok maybe the white tshirt underneath was a mite irregular compromise he fingered the white rose in his lapel everythings a compromise today my parents are both here with their respective spouses and jannys mother they all wanted a traditional old church wedding and we said well you wont find an older church than this one and charlies the real thing so wheres the problem the relatives stiffly obvious stood outside the circle near the hut where you left your courtesydonations to animal charities in memory of the poor sacrificed spaniel maybe matthew said er have you no oh gosh im so sorry but there are loads of people here who mightve run into her i already asked around grayle told him a little no luck uh huh suppose i get charlie to make a special appeal after the service how about that that would be kind you havent seen janny today no thats another compromise we wanted to spend the night here in the circle in a chaste sort of way in spiritual preparation and to see what our dreams might tell us about our future together but jannys mother may be better not to know grayle said maybe marriage should be an adventure thats one way of looking at it could be quite an adventure today actually just look at that sky itll hold off matthew after all the favours you did for mother earth its the least she can do it is nearly two am when he carries the woman to the organic tomb she falls to sleep in his arms and still slumbers as he brings her perspiring freely and smelling disgustingly of drink to the place a cloudy night but sufficient moon it glitters in the fluted tin roof of the helicopter shed which screens the place from the house his nightvision is pretty remarkable by now and he can see the eggshaped hole from twenty yards away on the edge of the freshly concreted base soon after dark he lined the hole three and half feet deep and oriented east to west with alternate layers of moss and gravel and then added a bed of soft grasscuttings warmly mulching beside the hole lies the mound of excavated soil and a heap of local gravel between them a spade the green man places the woman in the hole on her side she awakes and giggles and reaches out for him and he forces himself to caress her and she moans and drifts back into sleep she needs to be awake but not yet it came to him as always now in a dream he dreamed of a green land of mounds and standing stones and gaily dressed people horsetrading racing making merry while in the earth not far below the merrymaking a woman screamed for all eternity next day in the university library he found an account of a burial at a place called the curragh in county kildare where gypsies and tinkers traditionally gather for their fairs in a henge there about fifty years earlier an oval grave was found less than four feet deep and packed with gravel in this grave was the skeleton of a young woman on her back facing towards the rising sun the skull pressed hard down upon the chest and the arms tight against the sides of the grave the bones were in a contorted and unnatural posture suggestive of writhing in the hole the woman whimpers rolls onto her back and wiggles her fingers in the throes of some hallucinatory semidream she seems to be beckoning it is the sign the green man loads his spade with good red border soil the flesh of her body the woman chokes as the soil enters her mouth and her eyes open fear pushing through the psychic membrane of the drugs to meet the second spadeful cindy had to slam on the brakes and pull over onto the verge and bobby maiden almost fell out of the car rolled over in the grass producing enormous dry heaves mouth open fishlike and hands at his gut hed be fine cindy watched him through the windscreen and the tape played on the unbearable details only half registered what did register was the tone of voice on top of everything the green man remained the most insufferable prig after a minute bobby rolled over onto his back below the cars weak yellow headlights and cindy got out under a spreading fungus of dark brown clouds it was a dull country lane open fields and hedges not a house nor a steeple in sight cindy stood where bobby had been nothing but dented grass no evacuation it had all come out last night it was in an envelope nothing left other than what remained in bobbys head and now it was in the manageable part of his mind no longer buried deep why then bearing in mind the circumstances of its entry there had his subconscious mind not seen it from fraserhales side of things letting him experience the perverse ecstasy of unspeakable selfrighteous cruelty because of what he was he had experienced it only from the side of the victim bobby held on to a signpost to pull himself to his feet the sign pointed left to long compton and straight ahead to great rollright two miles which meant they were less than half a mile from the rollright stones cindy thought of the day when back home in the caravan in pembrokeshire hed let the pendulum dangle over the map and asked the question where will it happen next the pendulum had gone into a violent anticlockwise spin not where it was expected to go among the black mountains but over the area where oxfordshire met gloucestershire and warwickshire and cindy hoping for the welsh border had dismissed it sorry bobby produced a smile which contrived to be both bashful and bitter something went down the wrong way when we see grayle cindy said dont tell her will you youre joking bobby brushed grass from his jacket for what its worth cindy said as dispassionately as he could make it it was another of his failures she was supposed to have been buried alive like the woman in prehistoric kildare but when the soil went into her eyes she came out of it and began to scream at which our man felt obliged to finish her off with the spade in her throat he cant get anything right can he bobbys face as rigid as a mask his bad eye livid in the last unhealthy light dealing with it now he said i remember in one dream i saw his face shadowed by the spade that is the green man face twigs sprouting and again in a wreath in the front of a funeral parlour and yet we dont know what he looks like do we except hes a big lad with corncoloured hair harmlesslooking and we dont know if he has anything in mind for today he cant do much in front of an entire wedding party crowds arent his style unless surely bobby thats the problem doesnt have a style does he he responds to the location and the prevailing conditions and he watches for a sign which could be anything hes pretty free with his interpretations bobby was looking up into the east where the sky was darkest what is it boy he shook his head tell me bobby shrugged and cindy listened without interruption as he described a painting by turner showing stonehenge lit by a vivid storm maybe another of your archetypal images bobby said but i just had the feeling that was the bolt that hit me when i was dead theyve got a print of it at cefnybedd knocked me back seeing it magda said that was his favourite painting i assumed she meant falconer but that was stonehenge but the public isnt allowed into stonehenge any more security guards and everything its the one place he cant get to no indeed therere dead lambs in the picture bobby said and a dead shepherd its like the storms been drawn to the circle this break in the clouds like the eye of the storms just opened over stonehenge its a scene of violent death and theres a sense of inevitability about it see if i was him and that was my favourite painting and i just happened to be in a stone circle during a thunderstorm even i might see that as some kind of sign you know cindy said know much about meteorology do you how long for instance before this one arrives surprised we havent heard it already cindy looked into the hard tight sky and how many dead lambs xlvi marcus knew it was them by the speed the van was travelling youd think the drivers who would race along these lanes would be those who knew them best had negotiated them all their motoring lives could anticipate the angle of every treacherous bend not so the locals knew from bitter experience that if they crashed it would be into a neighbour or a neighbours wife or a neighbours second cousin who was pregnant or the midwife on her way to deliver the second cousins child the locals knew that if they crashed and it was their fault and someone died then the crash would live with them even unto the third and fourth generation no the locals took it easy pulled into the verge for oncoming tractors exchanged polite waves so marcus could tell by its reckless speed in the dusk and because it was an anonymous white van and because it drove past the castle entrance and then returned the same way within a couple of minutes that it was them he discovered that he had wedged himself against the highest most concealing part of what now constituted the battlements of the tower he found himself hunched up his hands gripping his knees he recognized what fell onto the left sleeve of his tweed jacket as a droplet of sweat truth was he hadnt really expected anyone to come at all it had occurred to him that in not leaving the farmhouse after andersons call he had been spectacularly stupid if maiden and cindy the bloody shaman had returned hed have told them about andersons message and theyd have urged him to go with them hed have refused naturally at first but might conceivably have backed down it occurred to him as he noticed how rapidly the sky was darkening and curdling that he might actually be rather frightened some of the families grayle saw were dubious about going inside the circle they hung around on the fringes a couple of feet behind the stones grayle moved back too hearing their whispers must be drab enough on a nice day ought at least to have the union blessed in a proper church and im sorry chris but if it starts raining i shall have to go back to the car not going to get much shelter from those pines are we sure wont grayle thought the pines stood tall and ravaged strung out behind the circle even more witchy somehow than the stones the people inside the stones making another circle were mostly young and casually dressed though with a flourish most of the women in long skirts like grayles a couple of guys wore sixtiesstyle caftans and there were bright gypsy scarves and vests new age earthmysteries chic charlie had brought his altar out over a bald patch in the grass close to the centre of the circle he was talking to matthew apparently there wasnt going to be a best man matthew said there should be just the three of them at the heart of it all himself his bride and the priest she wondered where adrian would stand when he arrived which group he would feel he belonged to the new agers or the establishment strange guy not what you first thought he was she wondered how he was getting on with the car there was a ragged cheer from the new age contingent as three men and a woman arrived with a couple of guitars and one of those irish hand drums and set up under a tall thrusting stone in the eastern part of the circle i can see we wont be having hymns then a relative observed sourly charlie had placed two candles on his altar with glass funnels round them to prevent the wind blowing them out there was no wind looking at the sky theyd need all the light they could get grayle she turned it was a voice she knew a face she didnt not at first greyhaired guy in a jacket and tie thank god he said im sorry cindy marslewis oh god what are you a word grayle he wasnt smiling he walked away not a single bangle jangling into the wood between the circle and the road and she followed with a sense of dumb foreboding behind on the edge of the circle the band had started playing an english folksong about its being pleasant and delightful on a midsummer morn and that sounded about as wrong as everything else here this evening two of them one was thickset almost chubby his head shaved close he wore jeans and a short denim jacket the other had a longer looser jacket one hand inside it he was a longer looser man all round he had spiky red hair and a seemingly permanent smile they must have left their van in the lane marcus hadnt heard it stop he kept very quiet at the top of his broken tower it was dark enough for there to be lights in the house and there were none theyd surely reason it out that there was nobody at home and bugger off or perhaps go back to their van and wait for someone to return when they had a slight struggle opening the fivebarred gate he saw they both wore short leather gloves and the squat man had a leather wristband with brass studs there was no creeping about they walked in as if they owned the bloody place marcus was furious whassis fucking castle think of it as a new experience bez lifes rich tapestry we never done a castle birmingham accents all im saying he never said nothing about a fucking castle he said castle farm you twat so we lived in castle close but there werent no fucking castle there and the next street up was called palace place but there werent are yow gonna shut the fuck up its only a fucking ruin be no fucking men at arms up there with fucking crossbows just fucking hate old places got rooms where they shouldntve got no rooms bits of wall sticking out fucking slits yer cant see whats the other side whats the fucking use of it knock em down i would yer scared yow ent yer yer fucking scared yer spooked fuck off they were standing now directly under the tower where marcus sat they were perhaps midtwenties kind of youths he used to teach used to have for breakfast ten years on marcus felt a sense of outrage the squat shavenheaded one cupped his hands around his mouth and bawled out anybody in anybody comes out the other one said tell em we broke down up the road and can we use the phone right the squat one walked out into the middle of the yard i said s there any fucker in turned back deserted what ywanna do bez not going back without no way we fucked up once fuck up twice you get a reputation well wait im not staying out here neither bez looked up gonna rain yow gon do a door ill just check the outbuildings in case and the castle case draculas in eh gallow fuck off the squat one gallow jerked up a forefinger and walked off towards the house hey s up just in case the redhaired one bez took his hand out from inside his jacket something gleamed which one you want gimme the sawnoff then might be a few of em in there keeping quiet sorta thing a gun a sawnoff bloody shotgun marcuss whole face seemed to explode with sweat they were assassins they were here to kill when you thought about professional killers you somehow imagined serious sinister taciturn individuals not mindless young cretins egging each other on taking the piss what was happening to the world bez turned away and looked up and around and marcus saw his face between the stones through the branches saw that bez was old beyond his years his face hard and flat his smile stamped on his eyes small and bright and compassionless marcus cursed maiden clutched the jagged stone that stood up like a single battlement and wished that maiden might never have a nights sleep for the rest of his miserable second life when gallow reached the front door malcolm barked shit fucking dog in there bez i hate it me when theres a fucking dog ent scared dogs ent cant threaten a dog gotta shoot it then ygotta fuck off case it made too much fucking noise and some fucker phones the filth get fucking real willya man no problem place like this no neighbours shotguns going off the whole time rabbits and things nobody gives a shit nobody even notices now go on do a door do a window any problem shout i hate the fucking country everythings too big gallow began to kick the front door looking for weak points in the kitchen malcolm barked and barked marcus hugged his jagged stone for support the bastard would get in start kicking open door after door until he reached the kitchen and then when the door was open malcolm would go silent observe the newcomer through his unbalanced eyes wondering if there might be a chocolate biscuit in this come waddling towards him a dog that wouldnt go in his basket at night without his teddy bear but unfortunately looked like a complete psycho an animal you wouldnt ever argue with especially if you happened to be tooledup and nervous meanwhile bez the one with no fear of spooky old buildings would probably be unable to resist investigating the one stone spiral staircase in the ruins bez was prowling the buildings and he was tooledup he was supposed to do what stand up on the battlements boom out you boy threaten them with five nights detention couldve been out of here two hours ago the dog too and why hadnt he gone because he didnt really believe it not precisely it was because maiden and cindy had buggered off to face up the delightful falconer with evidence that his ideas had inspired a madman leaving old man bacton to hold the fort make the tea attend to a few senior citizens chores marcus looked round for his eroded pitchfork ok we had a breakdown grayle said adrian organized a ride for me into chipping norton and he said hed call up the aa and wait for them and then hed bring the car later why do you need to know this they were standing out in the lane across from a big twirlyshaped outlying stone surrounded by railings cindy looking even more bizarre somehow in mens clothes had with him bobby maiden sans eyepatch and grilling her like a cop whats the car its a rover a small red rover something and you havent seen him since you left him at the roadside with the car no youre sure hes not here hes not here where could he be hiding out behind the pines still suspicious of these guys all this shamanic stuff the way cindy found a supernatural dimension to everything she hadnt needed it last night after her experience at the stones it had surely caused that awful dream of ersula and she sure as hell didnt need it at the rollright stones on the edge of a thunderstorm except that bobbys questions were clipped and urgent and entirely prosaic when you picked him up he have anything with him change of clothes was all in what a case a bag yeah he had he called it a cricket bag big long leather bag two handles we couldnt fit it in the trunk had to stash it across the back seat did you feel there was anything in it apart from clothes did it seem heavy when he picked it up was it bulging out anywhere i dont know what else could be in there cindy said perhaps a crossbow jesus whats all this about when you broke down bobby said what do you think was wrong what happened i dont know cars we started losing power the engine kind of whined fan belt could it have been that grayle shrugged cindy said what would be the significance of that was there any time adrian was with the car and you werent there not really i was driving oh after we ate i uh went to the bathroom and when i came out he was waiting in the parking lot at the car and you were in what five minutes jeez you wanna know what i did in there well i took a pee i washed my hands tried to make my hair look normal and how long after the pub did the car start playing up not long half a mile right see while you were in the bog he couldve slashed the fan belt so itd snap soon after you drove away why i dont know most likely to get you out of the way and get himself some wheels we should all be bloody glad it worked he might have done something more drastic cindy said he would never do that unless it was a sacrifice where killing is concerned he has his rules grayle said voice faltering what is this just what is this about all right cindy said he held her shoulders looked into her eyes you remember when we spoke the other night in my room at the inn of the contrasting aspects of the knoll male and female and the male element linked to blood slaughter grayle shook herself away before you go any further whats your angle who are you bobby brought out his wallet grayle had never seen british police id but it looked straight also he sounded right he looked all wrong but an undercover cop the whole point was he should look all wrong and you me cindy said a concerned member of the public and adrian someone who kills people bobby said it was kind of a hollow moment the words repeating themselves in her head and why grayle asked her head somewhere up there in the curdling sky but her voice down here and surprisingly calm why is he killing people because he believes thats how we should be living bobby said hunting and hunted and feeding the earth with blood we think hes killed about half a dozen people including my sister ersula right that scarily calm voice giving verbal substance to what shed instinctively known before she even left new york that ersula was dead and had been dead for weeks we think thats possible im sorry how did he kill her we dont know cindy said too quickly we think bobby said we think he may be planning to do something today here her voice still calm still grounded how was she doing this here seems the obvious place why would he want to take my car why not just stick along with me we dont know maybe he needed the car for something and he didnt want you around hed replace the fan belt no problem practical guy grayle said bitterly comes from a long line of solid chaps who are not terribly bright but good with their hands rigged up the portakabins laid down the helicopter pad she saw cindy wince ersulas death hung in the air between them either she could haul it down and go some place to weep or she could leave it suspended there until this was over if it would ever be over i think maybe something dawning on her he didnt want to be seen to be here didnt want to come in his own truck made some excuse that it wasnt roadworthy i thought he was just grabbing at the chance to be with me i thought maybe he uh when was this early morning id just checked out of the inn he pulled up in the street seemed surprised yeah real surprised to see me there he would be bobby said he thought hed killed you last night grayle drew breath felt a weakness behind her knees fifteen twenty yards away a metallic blue jaguar melted into the side of the road and a guy in a dark suit climbed out the drivers side came round and opened the passenger door performed a theatrical bow extended an arm and janny oates stepped out in a long plain white dress a golden circlet in her hair she saw grayle and waved all flushed and excited looking about sixteen and grayle waved back and forced an encouraging smile he followed someone last night bobby said were sure he thought it was you and he he killed her janny was luminous against the sky yes ohmygod im sorry to unload all this on you grayle we have to find him dont we we have to find him right now we do bobby said just tell me who else did he kill just people you wouldnt know them he didnt know them except for ersula yes a friend grayle said she was his friend listen he talked about sacrifices he said people would be horrified if they actually knew what it was like here in the old days he said sacrifice he said it was cruel but it was necessary he said that to you on the way here he said the best sacrifice the only real sacrifice was if you did it to someone who hadnt done you any harm he said the ultimate sacrifice was to take the life of a friend and and go on cindy whispered and he doesnt like new age stuff its like theyre wimps he said theyd done real damage to the traditions the wedding march was being played on a violin ragged and a little out of tune with guitar backing some people were cheering and i said a couple times i think i said this i said janny and matthew because those guys are real new agers as you can see i said you know what about them like how come if you hate all these people youre going to their wedding and he goes he just goes through the trees she could see that charlie had lit the candles on his altar it was close to dark theyre my friends marcus coughed it had taken him a while to build up the cough and now it was out there wasnt much to it but it was quiet in the castle precincts now that gallow and bez had split up malcolm had given up barking there was just the sound of bez kicking open the barn door the more distant thrust and rattle of gallow unsubtly forcing the rear door of the house so the cough was distinct it brought bez out of the barn into the darkening yard a splintering sound from behind the house meant gallow was in gallow loose in the house malcolm barked once bez said gallow he stood in the yard looking over towards the castle walls his hand went inside his jacket came out with a pistol a big one automatic they were completely bloody mad marcus thought drove halfway across england with an automatic pistol and a sawnoff shotgun in the van what would they do if they were stopped well they probably never had been and so it wouldnt happen and if it did they could always shoot it out the mad brutal arrogance of young men no animal more dangerous bez said gallow that yow marcus smothered his second cough in his handkerchief it was the cough of a man desperate not to cough crippling himself to keep quiet it was enough bez didnt say whos that or come out bez just wore his smile the cough had made him happy at the top of the spiral marcus tensed his arms so tight around the jagged stone that it rocked and that stone must weigh more than the average anvil marcus closed his eyes as bez put a foot on the first cracked stone stair there were eleven steps before the stairs broke off seven before the final curve come on then bloody well get it over with bez came up slowly one foot on a step then the other foot bez was god forbid some sort of bloody professional in the house gallow would be walking up the hall being careful because he didnt know where the dog was bez reached the fourth step gallow would have discovered the old treatment room three more doors to the kitchen please malcolm under the table you crosseyed bloody idiot stay quiet until he arrives outside the kitchen door and then hell know youve been shut in and hell simply turn away unless he thinks theres someone in there with you god fifth step two and a half years hed had malcolm ugliest pup the rspca kennels ever took in poor old malcolm six bez stopped listening hed see there was a curve ahead hed have his gun out in front of him marcus backed up the broken wall where the branches of the sycamore tree overhung sat on the top of the wall leaning back into the branches which dipped under his weight he was breathing hard his glasses half misted braced himself against the biggest branch holding on to it with both hands both feet wedged against the great stone that looked from the ground like a single battlement the yard was about thirty feet below break his bloody neck quite easily if he fell and hed rather fall than be shot by a moron and so bez arrived on the seventh step and saw marcus cowering on the edge of the tower half into the sycamore tree he relaxed all right pal he said im looking for maiden sonny marcus said through gritted teeth be bloody lucky if you can find a maiden over the age of twelve between here and chepstow bez didnt laugh funny man eh bringing the pistol into view this oil yer memory grandad ive got an excellent memory you cocky little bastard good yow gonna tell me where maiden is dont know what you mean then yow are fucking dead bez brought up the pistol old man marcus stared into the pistols small black hole and pushed both feet into the battlement stone the gun didnt even go off it clattered down from step to step quicker than bez as the stone toppled onto his chest and he clutched it to him with both arms as he fell backwards half spinning and when his head hit the stone lintel on the curve of the spiral there was a very delicate genteel little crack like the sound of two crown green bowls meeting in the stillness of a summer evening marcus stood on the top step for a moment with both hands over his face then he heard malcolm yelp and he snatched up his pitchfork and staggered down the steps at the bottom his eyes met bezs eyes and bez looked astonished both eyes wide open his mouth too bez was dead oh lord marcus said shocked into moderation oh god and then stumbled across the dark yard to the house edging round the building to the rear door the pitchfork out in front of him the light was on in the passage doors either side were flung open in the healing room bottles and jars had been swept from shelves some were still rolling on the stone floor and two clicked together reminding marcus of the appalling sound of bezs skull smashing his back to the wall his pitchfork pointed upwards he slid round the l in the passage the kitchen door came into view it was still closed from the other side of the panels the dog growled marcus saw gallows gloved hands around the sawnoff aimed at the kitchen door as he edged round the bend trying not to breathe he saw the whole of bulgingeyed shavenheaded gallow backed up the shotgun at groin level the way he must have seen sylvester stallone or some other movie oaf doing it gallows lips were pulled back over his clenched teeth come and fucking get it then gallow kicked the door which remained shut there wasnt room in the passage for anyone to get in a decent kick as gallows foot came back again marcus hurled himself round the corner baaastard pitchfork out in front aimed at the shotgun gallow spun round and the pitchfork missed when it connected with the wall at the end of the passage both its corroded tines fell off marcus stood there holding a wooden shaft looking into a double gun barrel the fuck are yow might ask the same question marcus said gruffly my bloody house back up marcus stood his ground i said back up y old fuck all right all right gallow prodded him back along the passage to the open rear door out slowly dont turn round as if he could as if he could take his eyes from those two black holes gallow bawled bez marcus said nothing stepped out backwards into the yard the only sound was malcolm barking way back in the kitchen yow on your own marcus raised his eyes to the snarlingly familiar horribly dangerous face of the boy with something to prove gallow was perhaps a couple of years younger than the late bez blotches of acne still fighting the stubble on his chin i said yow on your own not necessarily marcus said belligerently and gallows arms swung out and several things happened almost simultaneously with sickening force the shotgun barrel smacked him in the jaw and left cheek his glasses fell off something crunched into his left leg just below the knee he crumpled the yard blurred up at him he couldnt move bez where the fuck he was kicked in the stomach wheres my mate he retched and tried to curl into a ball but his knee wouldnt bend he heard the crunch of his glasses becoming powder under the heel of gallows boot he was wrenched up by the lapels dragged a few inches in the dirt flung back his head and shoulders meeting stone the house wall he could make out gallows shape against the light gallow with his legs splayed his shaven head like a hardboiled egg yow move a fucking inch ill smash yer eyes out got that couldnt if hed wanted to marcus moaned over the sound of gallows feet skidding away bez dont shit me man bez the shouts echoing between the house and the castle fading off the world had turned into a dark expressionist painting full of violent blotches marcus gave up trying to focus on it and consciousness slipped away like an ebb tide on a long beach along the beach skipped sally following a big coloured ball laughing the laughter echoing bez marcuss one coherent thought was that maiden and lewis couldnt be far away maiden knew what these people were like only one of them left now anyway one man and a gun out of it again footsteps along the sand sally darkness then he couldnt breathe his nose flattened under a great flat weight dead the weight lifted he snorted some air fucking dead the boot came down on his mouth this time slowly enough for him to catch a brief blurred zigzag flash of rubber hes fucking dead smell of metal two endless black metalsmelling tunnels under his eyes and so are yow there was a brief moment of total awareness an absolute knowledge of who he was why he was here why he was here on this earth no pain only this brilliant crystal clarification of the big mystery marcus closed his eyes and never heard the big bang he saw two smiling girls running hand in hand across a golden hay meadow one girl was in sepia the other in bright glowing colours xlvii the king stone nearly eight feet tall was like a caged beast inside its iron schoolyardtype railings to maiden standing in an open field behind it now it seemed like a huge head and neck attached to feet or claws half sunk into the worn grass clutching at the ground as if it was preparing to spring out of there known as an outlier this is cindy set down his suitcase outside the rails we often find them in the vicinity of stone circles but set apart for astronomical reasons usually or it gives you a line on the rising sun not sure about this chap never having worked here before maybe once the king stone and the rollright circle had been part of the same prehistoric observatory or whatever it was but now they were separated by a road and a hedge and part of a wood cindy opened the case brought out a rolledup woollen mat maiden opened the gate in the railings and cindy carried the mat through and spread it out next to the king stone the mat displayed an interwoven celtic design such as you saw on ancient crosses far as im concerned bobby if they call this the king stone and the circles known as the kings men then this old chap has to be the boss getting better feelings i am from him certainly he hates these bars but hes kept his distance from some of the bad things thatve happened in the circle hasnt been tampered with much kept his integrity see i think i can work with him maiden and grayle watched him in sceptical silence against a luminous backdrop of the most malign combination of dusk and stormclouds maiden ever recalled every hole and hollow and crevice in the king stone was clearly defined this seemed crazy timewasting probably irresponsible logically maiden thought what they should be doing was simply calling the police who would send two cars maybe three if they were informed that the murderer bobby maiden was here and then what theyd arrest him and hed try to explain in the little time they had it was impossible convincing even sensitive reborn maiden had taken many hours plus the discovery of a womans body in a concrete grave so whats going to happen he was tense restless the impending storm getting to his nerves desperate to move flush out fraserhale needed to see him to know the disease im going to talk to the storm cindy said i see maiden said do you no all right bobby very quickly weather control marcus knows more about the scientific side of this than me and i wish we had him with us but the electrical storm is a terrific source of energy the most powerful phenomenon in natures bag of tricks and there is evidence that neolithic people sought to control storms using megalithic circles and perhaps to store the energy so that rain could be summoned when it was needed how would they use stone circles because theyre invariably sited at places where underground streams intersect places which are likely to attract bolts of lightning seeking to discharge themselves in the earth grayle this cricket bag of adrians could it have contained for instance rods of iron or copper i guess when you were in or around the circle did you see anything of that nature sticking out of the ground anywhere i dont recall im sorry what would they be for lightning conductors perhaps bobby if you remember when he is discussing the circumstances of the killing of the birdwatcher he talks of dismissing clouds and also creating them by willpower and meditation yes so we know hes studied weather control suppose hes convinced himself he can bring about by force of will an electrical storm like the one in mr turners picture suppose hes been working on this for quite a considerable time with this little gathering in mind grayle backed off from the king stone at a wedding thats what he meant by sacrificing friends i dont know this is speculation adrians view of our remote ancestors has them as rather less practical and scientific and agriculturally minded than we would perhaps like to think a storm as your picture demonstrates is a dynamic killingforce aw come on grayle said hes just a guy practical guy though maiden said and at the risk of sounding religious cindy said history has shown that individuals who wish to do evil can seemingly attract to themselves an element of shall we say backup but i dont want to talk like this i dont want to court your scepticism lets just say that if theres a grain of truth here we can do three things we can find adrian fraserhale and constrain him we can stop this wedding and we can try to hold off the storm meanwhile do you see maiden didnt see not really adrian was not like cindy he was a nutsandbolts man he was practical still he told grayle as they crossed the road between a couple of dozen parked cars to get back to the circle you learn not to dismiss anything cindy comes up with when they took a final look back at the king stone there was a big red thing on top with wings and bulbous eyes you could see even from this distance cindy must have stood on his suitcase to prop it up there what the hell is that bobby i think its kelvyn kite his er shamanistic totem creature something like that dont think about it youll only lose confidence they turned left into the small wood which hid the entrance to the circle the congregation was hushed the two candles flickered innocently ok grayle whispered im gonna be straight with you i dont know what to believe like i said a problem you tend to have around cindy maiden dropped behind the wooden hut no listen to me grayle said ersula do you know shes dead her lower face was in shadow her eyes through a soft tumble of hair were bright with pleading i bobby i just need to hear what you believe is the truth well a bodys been uncovered at cefnybedd in the ground its a young woman very light blond hair oh ok steadying her voice thats thats i dont know her do i but he says he killed her you talked to him when he left tapes he talks all the details into a recorder at the high knoll burial chamber laying down his own evp for posterity that make sense to you like a confession more like a celebration friends from the circle the ministers voice rose up loud and relaxed were gathered here today in the sight of god oh yes it is whatever some of you might think about stone circles laughter grayle said and the woman when he thought hed killed me was called emma curtis she was my friend close friend she was the woman who collected me last night at castle farm while you were there it was going dark like now and she had light hair and he thought it was you hed followed you down from the knoll that was your mistake the knoll is his and he climbed into his land rover and he tailed us to a hotel and later when she was on her own he he killed her after he discovered the hotel was at the crossing point of two leys serendipity the minister said joyfully to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony how did he kill her with a carpet knife jesus and ersula we cant be sure itll take a postmortem but he waited the cause of death may be a kind of suffocation she shook a little she didnt want to hear any more youre not lying to me are you i swear to god im not lying to you now said the minister it says here in this little prayer book that marriage is an honourable estate instituted of god in the time of mans innocence signifying to us the mystical union between christ and his church i want us to think about that about what it means close friend huh almost maiden said and there must have been a fissure in his voice because grayle suddenly clung to him for just a second then let him go stepped away blinking hard bonding of the bereaved she said jesus he could be in these woods he could be just yards away from us now she didnt look around this shamanic stuff of cindys you believe he can intercede with nature head off that storm do i hell maiden said grayle nodded so we need to stop the ceremony no need to make a drama out of it we just get everybody together in one place well clear of the circle for safety i know the minister said that some members of janny and matthews families must think a stone circle is a highly unsuitable place for a wedding ill do it grayle said im from new york everybody knows how crass and crazy we are i got nothing to lose just dont start a panic be playing into his hands be discreet sure what will you do if hes here ill find him i have to find him how he didnt reply and what do we think of when we think of a wedding the minister asked we think of a ring and here we are all of us inside one of the oldest rings in these islands joining together in our faith perhaps our various faiths to celebrate love so id like us all to join hands no come on theres nothing pagan about this were all decently dressed if youre gonna be alone grayle said you make sure he doesnt find you first i know or cindy hes alone too if you dont include the spirits of the air i could get quite fond of that old weirdo grayle said but spirits of the air i can live without you take care i have to know cindy said deep inside himself is it blood you want is it the lifeblood of mammals is it our terror do you thrive on the fear of the fox before the hounds tear it apart and do you suck the lifeforce released in the blood of a woman or a man at one of your shrines at the crossing of energy lines and ghost roads i have to know or this is useless from the top of the king stone kelvyn cackled contemptuously you old fool you dont even know who youre talking to it was true hed never known the welsh were a contradiction they both worshipped nature and feared the god of the old testament in whose honour they built in place of standing stones all those grim grey monolithic chapels shrines to cruel nature a cruel god and yes there were times when that old testament god would have struck down the guests at a wedding with hardly a thought in the old testament people died for being in the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong company cindy he opened his eyes on the other side of the railings stood bobby maiden this is a bit hard bobby said if you want the truth hed taken off his jacket stood there his tshirt brilliant against the sky torn at the left shoulder tell me lovely grayles trying to stop the ceremony im wandering around like a spare prick and what i thought anybody can find him its got to be me right its an argument only i dont know how to go about it and possibly you can help i see cindy rocked a little on his shamans mat working this out you want to go back into the darkness into the cold whatever remembering that the whole point of last night was to get you out of there and to get it out of you the way i see it for a few seconds me and him i may be losing it a bit here but i feel some part of him collided with some part of me so it seems maybe they need to collide again cindy deliberated taking several long pensive breaths kelvyn cackling nastily in his head dont think about it too long bobby folded his arms i think i can hear the cold calling hmm cindy stood up couldnt spring up these days like he used to old age catching up what a bind it was i helped to bring you out see but i cant ask you to go back you have to ask me isnt it this is how its done shamanic etiquette bit more than that lovely do you really want to ask me i think i just did cindy made him sit on the mat forget the shamanic posture no time for that sit however was most comfortable and then blindfolded him with a black woollen scarf pulling it tight heedless of the bruised eye dont fight it dont try and see through it submit to it steady your breathing empty your mind from the suitcase he brought the envelope that envelope he emptied the pieces of dry soil into his palm and crumbled them into dust whether this had come out of bobby didnt matter it was what they had found on the capstone when he stopped vomiting and it connected directly with the worst of all deaths the choking in the earth of ersula underhill dont worry about time there will be time cindy sprinkled the soil in a thin circle around both bobby maiden and the king stone step out of time and think dark think cold lifting his drum from the case fingers finding the rhythm after me dark dark cold cold dark is cold dark is cold cold is dark cold is dark cold is earth it was a pity even the older family guests were getting into it resistance breaking down charlie had charm he had style it was a friendly participatory wedding he was making more of it than most of these guys did in grayles experience most likely spinning it out because he was having fun too and because of the dope maybe they were all holding hands even the relatives and now the band was leading them in a hymn charlie was facing where the sky was darkest so that janny and matthew the other side of the picnic table altar could look into the last light not that there was much of that see charlie could have had it all over by now the ceremony part at least not that this would get everyone out of the circle someone having erected another picnic table out by the pines this one more secular bottles of champagne on it towers of paper cups getting their moneys worth out of the rollrights this black saturday while they sang the hymn all things bright and beautiful grayle wandered quietly among the guests looking into their faces fearful that one would be the rugged corntopped visage of adrian fraserhale he was not here neither were there any stakes or rods protruding from the earth inside the circle what would she have done if shed found one pulled it out would that have made everything fine made the dark clouds disperse sure and brought ersula back to life earth is dark earth is dark earth is cold earth is cold when bobby started shivering cindy stopped drumming reduced his chant to a whisper brought out the cloak of feathers and hung it round bobbys shoulders it was pm and almost night but not cold this night was as close as october could get to humid only cold apparently where bobby was which was how it should be but cindy wasnt happy about this it was unknown country a level of being hed had no experience of a harsher more elemental place kept in motion by the energy of slaughter and it made no difference at all that this was in all probability an entirely imaginary country which had never existed outside a single disturbed psyche the chant had taken its own direction bobby no longer responding to cindys words which again was how it should be but also rather frightening it meant that cindy no longer had a measure of control he prayed for assistance without knowing quite to whom the prayer was addressed earth is dark earth is cold earth is grave earth is grave earth is dark is cold is grave bobby stopped chanting he was utterly still did not even appear to be breathing face as pale as his tshirt cindy heard a humming not heard exactly he was aware of a humming it was coming not from bobby but from the king stone the stone blurred before his eyes and seemed to swell then came into sharp focus despite the paucity of light he could see every smear of mould and liverspot of lichen bobby maidens lips parted as if to resume the chant but all that came out was a hiss a sibilance a rustling in more than one tone as though one hiss was communicating with another a whispered conversation a whispered conversation between huddled figures identifying the location cindy shook him yelling in his face stop get up get up they could have got through this it could have been over but then just as charlie came to that routine stuff about how if anyone knew of any just cause or impediment why these two fine young people should not right this minute be declared man and wife then then in the east over towards the city of oxford came a small but vivid flaring in the sky christ pushing peoples hands apart grayle ran out towards the altar reaching it about half a second before the distant punch of thunder listen im sorry im sorry the reverend charlie broke off half turned to her another faraway fan of lightning briefly lit up his creased surplice grayle charlie listen to me we have a problem no sweat but we need to suspend this ceremony until the storm passes we have to get all these people out of here laidback old charlie a dopehaze over his senses he just looked at grayle kind of curious but matthew lyall a bulge in his top pocket that anyone could see was a ring box was coldsober and angry who says me i say please you saw the lightning thats bad news matthew that is very seriously bad news see i was hoping it was gonna pass but it didnt and thats real bad news im sorry grayle what on earth are you trying to do this is our wedding i uh listen i got a bad feeling about this whole thing im a very sensitive person matthew ok holy holy grayle right in the states people listen to me you should listen to me ill listen to you as long as you like when janny and i are married which would probably have been by now if you hadnt you saw that lightning up in the sky its gonna come closer my feeling i get feelings ok you should listen to my feelings and my er strong deepdown psychic feeling is you should not be getting married in a storm its bad luck it will overshadow your whole married life cause instability and in uh infertility your marriage will be barren in the third slightly brighter flash janny oatess face crumpled like a paper bag and grayle felt like a piece of shit the slow rolling thunder seemed to set off mutterings everywhere who the hell is this woman demanded some deeply offended deeply oxfordenglish mans voice among the congregation she on drugs a fourth flash lit a stone which was knotted and eroded good christ into the shape of a hunchedup grinning winged demon with a long neck and a bony crest on top of its head jesus it was just a stone they were all just stones like adrian fraserhale was just a guy im someone who knows grayle cried ok xlviii maiden moved quickly but circuitously across the field dont use the path cindy had warned its too straight and dont whatever you do put yourself between the circle and the knights the whispering knights the whispering knights was the name given to another collapsed dolmen once a kind of high knolltype structure but taller and the stones had folded in on one another and now they were like giants conspiring the monument was in a fairly vast open field on the opposite side of the road from the king stone and about a quarter of a mile from the rollright circle you cant miss them bobby theres nothing else in that field only a sprinkle of trees on the horizon a line of hedge marking a field boundary all briefly shown to him by the sheet lightning some miles away yet but closing and unfortunately anyone inside those stones they cant miss you when the lightning came again like a revolving searchlight maiden dropped into the short grass the image of the knights burned into his mind they were surrounded by railings like the king stone but far bigger more like big birds than men black hooded crows huddled rising earth release me clouds cushion me sky receive me cindy felt himself looking down on the bonehard cotswold ridge imagining his body growing lighter than the clouds in all senses of the word his cloak of feathers coming alive becoming wings and the wings when he spread them all aglow the fychans had taught him this the fychans father and son there had been a grandfather too and two more generations before him taking the family tradition back into the eighteenth century and farther back to the days when the family house of rubble was a house of skins the word shaman never used no specific welsh word for shaman dynion hysbys they called the fychans the men who know when a christmas show in llandudno had been abandoned following a fire at the theatre cindy had wandered south into the mountains around cader idris happened to stop at the fychan farmhouse for a nights bed and breakfast which turned into two nights then three weeks and several years on and off the fychans forever saying in their sly north walian way that hed never make a proper dyn hysbys not being born to the welsh language but he would be well something it was an inner way a discipline it did not exclude christian ethics it harnessed the imagination in a practical way now cindy made himself go walking in the unstable sky into the nervous system of the storm imagining every charcoal cloud he touched being softened by his incandescence when lightning came at him he opened himself to it and the electricity hit him in a great sizzling spasm of agony but he walked on playing with the storm taunting it like a liontamer with a whip only it wasnt a whip not really cindy suspected that it was no more than a piece of string that he was not a great and powerful shaman but very possibly an ageing sham less than thirty yards from the whispering knights now and bobby maiden was wriggling along the ground on his stomach because there was nothing in that flat spacious field but him and the knights and anything which the knights might enclose if fraserhale was here there wasnt going to be much of an element of surprise but advertisement wouldnt help something inside him started quivering like a very thin wire trepidation hed never seen adrian fraserhale only his bloodwashed leavings trepidation where there should have been hatred he wondered how his dad would handle this wondered what had really happened the night norman plod took on harry skinner and his lads in the old paint warehouse at wilmslow the daft things you thought about when you were terrified aw come on hes just a guy just a guy who killed and killed and killed again and was never even suspected to exist because his motivation was beyond the accepted parameters of criminal behaviour out of the darkness out of the old stones the green man spoke hullo there sheet lightning showed him leaning over the railings flophaired boyish maiden didnt move dont come any closer will you old chap the green man said i wouldnt recommend it rather tense tonight maiden didnt reply the darkness settled back around him like a security blanket he couldnt believe the voice together with the flashimage the voice so clear in the still taut air had brought up a ludicrous picture of some cool young world war two airman leaning against his spitfire smoking a pipe and wondering in a desultory way what jerry had up his sleeve for tonight except you might stand up quite like to take a look at you next time theres a flash so fraserhale couldnt see him didnt know how close he was perhaps had heard him moving across the field hadnt seen him in the lightning which made him seem less of a threat less of a finetuned hawkeyed allsensing stone age stalker half man half will o the wisp woodland sprite so lets have you on your feet shall we see who you are maiden said carefully who do you think i am barely a pause someone the woman told i suppose made a mistake there but we broke down in the wrong place you see engines are manmade imprecise i cant be doing with things i havent made myself what womans that adrian oh blond hair american someones sister green man psychological profile when they lost their identity became the man the woman it meant theyd been consigned to the mental file marked sacrificial you mean the place you broke down it would have been wrong to kill her there nowhere near a ley or a sacred site who are you maiden kept his voice steady im your shadow adrian i was with you in the new forest under the pines near avebury and last night at collen hall who are you plain curiosity it doesnt matter you wouldnt know me no adrian said it certainly doesnt matter to me for the moment but we know you quite a few of us tip the scales a little make him feel exposed analysed possibly surrounded weve been watching you for quite a while with what purpose to learn bloody hell the arrogance think remembering while he was with the met being sent on a siegenegotiators course not the full course a weekend primer playacting learning to relate to the hypedup nutter at the upstairs window holding a blade to his former girlfriends throat the fugitive on the eleventhfloor balcony with the baby keep them talking become a friend the only friend theyve got the course had been short on advice for dealing with a passionately motivated assassin perfectly at home among neolithic stones with a storm on the way his ideal killing situation but you didnt know quite who he was planning to kill or quite when or quite how only how hed killed the others no specific mo apart from being governed by earthforces which might not exist outside the labyrinth of his mind maiden rolled onto his side over to the right there was a tiny twin glow the candles on the wedding altar over four hundred yards away were the people all still there had they moved away leaving the candles and dont whatever you do put yourself between the circle and the knights adrian he said the thing is youve quite impressed us we dont think theres ever been anyone precisely like you then you must be pretty stupid if you think that there was a time when everyone was like me hunting hunting to live living to hunt feeding the organism feeding the earth the great energy cycle its the big secret adrian laughed a fullbodied ha ha ha sort of laugh killing makes the world go round terrific what did you say for once cindy was wrong the storm might be a psychological trigger but he wasnt expecting the storm to do his killing for him too random the green man liked to be in full control the whispering knights was a perfect strategic observation post a little island was he waiting for someone here would someone be sent like the birdwatcher had maiden fallen into that role it wasnt enough pull him out of the abstract tie him down a name i gather roger falconers been using your ideas ideas well you know what i mean we were going to write a book together thats what he told you is it you and roger both names on the front not sure not sure he deserves it worried he might rip you off a pause rip i may rip his throat out i may give him to the knoll have to leave the knoll something when i go could be roger what do you think talking to maiden as someone who having studied the green man was expected to grasp the point where are you going adrian pause who did you say you were you wouldnt know me my names robert youre right i dont know anyone called robert what do you do im a painter like turner i dont know much about art but you know what you like and you like the picture of stonehenge in the storm thats a turner no yes watch it no sorry must be thinking of another one dont be stupid i know which one you mean the lightning called into the circle and the sheep waiting to die for the earth and the shepherd one of the worlds greatest works of art a message from the earth i mean it doesnt matter who daubed the paint on its a spiritual work a coded message to mankind theyre all willing sacrifices i mean for heavens sake a shepherd knows when theres a storm coming a shepherd on salisbury plain and i was born near there he knows to avoid the stones because when it happens there its going to be a big one i mean not now perhaps because stonehenge is pretty useless now with all the tourists but then when was that painted about gave himself up that shepherd and a few sheep im glad you spotted that robert youre starting to understand and whats the message adrian whats the coded message youll see youll know thats why were here right no reply you said stonehenge was pretty useless now thats why youve come here right laughter these stupid railings what do they think theyre keeping out or keeping in very good robert very perceptive are you standing up robert i want to see you so do the knights maiden lay still thought he heard shouts from the circle they were still there what was she doing adrian laughed why dont you come closer robert come and watch its like an army its regrouping gathering its forces conserving its energy and its coming its coming its very close the storm and whats going to happen when it comes i like you robert adrian said but you ask too many questions something came then the first fork lightning a jagged white crack in the sky and it was close speared the trees on the horizon and told you adrian cried splashed with icemilk light arms raised in euphoria amid the knights and the whump of thunder told you told you told you the next one thats the sign the next one will be it no talking this one down all right adrian he stood up im coming over see grayle screamed and she wasnt the only woman there who did when all the stones lit up i thought you knew all about this stuff stone circles attracting lightning and all on account of the streams crossing you stay here youre gonna get blasted oh lets go janny sobbed its all ruined now anyway it was a stupid idea no matthew shouted grayle i cant believe youre doing this this is the most wonderful thing thats ever happened to me its a blessing tell her charlie well charlie said they do say an electric storms an act of god but whether its a blessing its absolutely tremendous its ruined janny shrieked i can get you a church charlie said phone call should do it i think you better had people pushing forward im the brides father and i think shes had just about enough of this nonsense i dont want a bloody church matthew shouted just do the business charlie tie the knot no you dont understand theres a killer out there with jannys father grayle saw was duncan murphy the professor from oxford hadnt noticed him before come on grayle he said i think youve made your point duncan you have to listen me theres a mad guy duncan murphy and some other man they took an arm each and lifted her off her feet and back into the congregation he could see the knights but no adrian no telling how much time he had the only way hed know what they were up against was to get inside those railings step inside the tigers cage and then would he still be robert then when the energy exploded when the shit hit the fan or would have become the man maybe a poor specimen and later tonight the green man would be talking his stormlit death into the burial chamber at black knoll ok im here adrian adrian walking those last few paces his head was clearing pleasanter now the night a bit cooler hands in his pockets the essence of peat coming back to him damp and lonely a dodgy streetlamp flickering on and off and even when it was on it wasnt fully on so you could almost see the filament in the bulb a worm of bluewhite light she was standing under the lamp and seemed to be going on and off like the light you saw her and then you didnt emma he saw the face of the woman under the lamp it wasnt ems though she was about the same age her hair was in a bun she had a case at her feet she disappeared in the lightning it came down against all the earthmystery rules not in the circle but in the pines those skeletal stalky pines but it lit the circle seemed as if it lit up every one of the seventyplus cheesy pockmarked weathered stones so savage and so bright was the lightning that it seemed you would have had time to walk round and count them all one more time before it faded except that grayle and possibly she was the only one of them was not looking at either the stones or the pines a couple of which had caught fire but at jannys wedding dress the only thing here which was conspicuously not an unnatural blazing white jannys wedding dress from the waist to the prim high neck had grown a sunburst of deepest rosiest red no jesus grayle stood transfixed feeling the hands of duncan murphy and the other guy dropping away and then spinning round saw a small flash across the big flat field and there was also a crack not the thunder surely because the thunder was almost directly overhead like an avalanche in the sky and grayle wasnt sure of the order any of this was happening because so many terrible things were happening but that was a shot that god damn it was a gunshot at some point janny finally screamed and maybe it was at the thunder or maybe because she saw that she was soaked with blood or maybe in the light of the burning pine trees she saw charlie sinking slowly to his knees as if he was praying for deliverance with a hole the size of a fist in the front of his surplice and everything emptying out several people saw charlie fall and there were screams of incomprehension that the lightning could do this a guy rushed forward and a woman shrieked dont touch him he could be live but grayle underhill knew there was nothing live about charlie any more and she found herself walking purposefully out of the circle and into the big flat field where shed seen the flash and where by the light of the burning pines she could now see some stones hunched up like gloating old men well as you see adrian said its an old mauser nothing fancy bolt action had it since i was a boy used to be my grandfathers bit of a wartime heirloom super old thing maiden had been struggling to find the gate in the high railings surrounding the whispering knights could have tried to climb over but hed never have made it and adrian would have shot him and left him bleeding there on top of the iron spikes but nothing like that adrian had opened the gate for him peering at his face in the faint sparky light from the blazing pines four hundred yards away adrian beaming come in robert you can come in now proudly showing him the setup the sight he detached the rifle from a metal frame wedged between two of the knights well i simply bought that at a gun shop in worcester utility stuff the support i made myself people say youre very practical one tries sharp screams of terror spattered the sky like sparks over the rollright stones he must have killed or wounded two shots energy adrian said look at those flames thats confirmation oh god robert feel the release feel that glorious glorious release of pure terrestrial energy the fusion of the earth and the sky and whump adrian was skyhigh in his army sweater and his camouflage trousers he looked strong swelling with power you could smell his sweat like engine oil feel his heat he caressed the rifle in his arms even without it he wouldnt have regarded maiden as any kind of threat or any kind of sacred chosen target because maidens approach had been along no known or even suspected ley everything in adrians world was completely straightforward rigidly aligned he grinned from a summit of selfbelief mustve got two robert like some countrysport enthusiast talking pheasants do you think two there was a smell of burning in the hellish rosy night three wouldve been better but i was only given the light for two so one has to go with the surge when youre working together breathing together better than sex adrian maiden recalling the green mans long liquid shuddering moan as the lightning flared and the gun went off wrong adrian stiffened he made a contemptuous noise adrian was a moralist adrian had strict ethics adrian did not like dirty talk so who are you adrian said unfriendly again maiden felt dogtired used up whatever energy had been generated it wasnt accessible to him i said adrian placed a hand in the centre of maidens chest pushed him hard against the rails who are you adrian was bigger heavier swollen with selfrighteousness close up for the first time maiden could see his eyes glittering with the mindless joy of the bully seen it so many times in his dads eyes when norman brought the slipper out norman didnt wear slippers he only had the one used for disciplinary purposes discipline authority adrian would know all about that ok then maiden drew a hard breath im detective inspector bobby maiden he paused this was ridiculous adrian fraserhale im arresting you for the murder of ersula underhill you do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention when questioned anything you later rely on in court anything you do say will be taken oh adrian retreated to the railings the rifle in his arms i see this would be the first time anyone had applied the word murder to adrians continuing programme of sacrificial bloodletting maiden took a determined step towards him further charges will be made later hand me the rifle adrian adrian a faint subdued voice said from the other side of the railings oh shit maiden said she stood in the grass fifteen twenty yards away a small figure in a torn skirt hair sweated to her cheeks come on adrian maiden held out his hands for the rifle but really the hands were out there in prayer do the sensible thing eh maiden said just like the old man wouldve said grayle underhill said oh feeling fraserhales attention waver maiden went for him went for the gun and felt the air pulse as adrian moved with a swift and shocking grace bringing up the rifle half turning as maiden went for him that fixed opaque glaze of madness in adrians eyes his teeth bared and parted you could almost see the twisted fibrous roots and stretched tendrils in the green mans feral smile as he brought down the wooden rifle butt hard into maidens eye the left one the one that was still half closed as maiden sank in agony to his knees the world was divided into blurred segments by the railings through which he could see the pale wavering shape which would by now be sharp and tight in adrians line of fire the womans on the line robert the voice of the green man quivering with euphoria and a kind of wonder at the gloriously unexpected magic of the situation i said it should be three didnt i the womans on the line xlix never occurred to andy to be scared until she was inside the castle walls and there was no light never been here before at night when there werent at least a couple of lights in the house so marcus wasnt here well good good probably where would he have gone down to st marys most likely into the pub andy would turn the car round go check out the pub ok no problem she curved slowly round under the castle wall taken her over three hours to drive down from elham through the rush hour and then another damn rush hour and then foot down but not too hard because it would be pretty stupid if having driven twice round the suburbs to throw off any pursuit she was nicked on some bloody cart track in the black mountains thered been no pursuit anyway shed have known would have been easy enough for riggs to put out her registration to every force in britain it was clear enough now that riggs had done no such thing that the other person tony parker had felt obliged to contact with a view to calling off the bad guys was mr riggs himself and that mr riggs had said no or that tony had died before he could even get round to asking him the bad guys presumably had been but had the bad guys gone best to stay in the car a while andy checked the doors were locked leaning across to the passenger side glancing out of the passenger window she saw the body marcus backed up in a frenzy turned the car round so that the headlights were on the face breathed again when it turned out not to be a face she knew some young guy with dark brown dried blood around a deep dent in his forehead one arm skewed out with a hand upturned clawed a block of stone beside him big enough to mark his grave if he needed one wasnt moving looked all twisted up but the hell with this andy got out checked for vital signs cold dead a good while what was this this one of the bad guys way he was twisted it was pretty clear hed come crashing down the tower steps treacherous those steps particularly in the dark but why the hell would he go up there in the first place andy looked around dead silence and then the house door opened sister anderson guy in a bomber jacket was walking across the dark yard towards her she knew the voice but then she knew a hell of a lot of voices whoever it was hed been in the house if anybody was in that house it ought to be marcus not so much scared as seriously apprehensive she waited right where she was within reach of the car until his face was in the headlights well she said i didnae think itd be you bloody judas eh it began to rain big hard vertical bullets with a lot of difficulty grayle raised her eyes from the rifle barrel which didnt move so long as she didnt which was pointing steadily at her breast bone this is where i i get to die right she tried to see his face she thought how charlie had died not even crying out never knew poor charlie came to conduct a wedding and he died adrian said dont talk rejoice rejoice grayle flared up that what you told ersula when she the bitch was unreceptive at the end she heard bobby maiden speak though she couldnt see him he sounded weak he sounded hurt adrian said be quiet robert bloody coward adrian but thats hunting isnt it essence of a great british tradition guys with guns against animals that only run guys on horses with packs of hounds against one exhausted shut up natural balance isnt it but hell adrian yours dont even get a chance to run ill kill you you miserable piece of townbred vermin when this is over ill take you away to somewhere less sacred and ill kick the life out of you in the meantime youll shut your drivelling mouth and you dont kill bobbys voice battling against the rain singing on the stones the earth kills remember you cant do it on your own and the moments gone the lightnings over storms past its raining youve lost it you cant do it without the lightning please god grayle thought no more lightning please god please cindy also bobby said from somewhere down on the ground between adrian and the back rails also this is grayle you killed her once and it wasnt her you blew it got it wrong grayles bad luck for you adrian i do not get it wrong youre always getting it bloody wrong what about the barbed wire in wales put it out for a man you catch a young lad but he didnt die did he you screwed up silence other noises behind the spattering on the stones the smell of smoke from the pines grayle felt the rain pouring down her face blurring her vision her clothes like a second sodden skin she was afraid to blink adrian said how do you know about that ah bobby said didnt tell the stones did you didnt tell the stones you screwed up distant sheet lightning no more than a veil grayle cringed the barrel twitched oh jesus involuntarily grayle squeezed her eyes shut screamed adrian do you know who you shot down there you shot charlie shot the goddamned minister well good he screamed back through the torrent charlie was a disgrace charlie took drugs and what the fuck did you give to ersula bobby yelled you watch your filthy vermin mouth maybe grayle would like to know what else you dont tell the earth hey considering where we are considering how stones record maybe the earth would like to know what happens when you when you take a sacrifice when you pull the trigger bring down the rock sink in the knife shove shovel in the gravel and the concrete when the earthenergy floods into your system like golden light and you feel this blinding joy maybe grayle and the good old earth goddess your mother your holy bride would like to know what happens then how you always come in your pants when you filthy swine grayles eyes jerked open to the sight of adrian up on the lone recumbent stone screaming holding the rifle by the barrel smashing it down on bobby maiden bobby shouting get off the line grayle get off the fucking line and then it was all lights l that supposed to mean on the edge of the headlight beams the guy looked worn out two days grey stubble tony sent you right kind of nothing to do with riggs like i dont work for riggs oh aye well nobody does do they nobody works for riggs officially look sister vic clutton said times getting on ive got a bit of cleaning up to do before i leave i hope that doesnae include me pal oh dont be bloody daft clutton pulled a gun a black pistol out of his jacket pocket tossed it into the dirt pick it up feel safe andy ignored the gun what happened to your oppo over there shit sister you gonner let me get a word in parker andy took a breath clutton said parker had me down here to keep an eye on em didnae do a great job there victor look avoiding her eyes talking rapidly to his shoes i was to watch her getting into bad company policemen this kind of

white van pulls in and out jumps these blokes and shit i know em last seen in maidens flat you remember that business just a minute andy walked over to the corpse who is this guy and wheres names bez he was shambling across the yard a short fat guy in a tartan dressing gown the big stupid bull terrier trotting alongside like this was big walkies time dont ask me what kind of bloody name that is anderson and hes fucking well dead and im merely dying so if you happen to have your little nurses outfit with you vic said mr bacton i thought i told you to lie down the cops came in from all directions almost simultaneously in force four cars and a van the van was directly into the field all these guys tumbling out with automatic rifles the whole place surrounded portable lights the stone circle cordoned off armed guys around the back of the pines some of them still smouldering in the hard vertical rain a helicopter hovered above the whispering knights with a searchlight in case adrian fraserhale should overpower the three detectives and the four armed response blokes and make a break for it across the fields seemed adrian wasnt in the mood when he saw the van coming hed stopped hitting bobby with the gun and hed turned it round and grayle had thought jesus hes gonna put it in his mouth but adrian had just looked at the gun in dismay like checking the barrel wasnt bent or anything and then the cops were screaming at him ordering him to lie down grayle too also bobby except the poor guy already was adrian handcuffed was looking kind of affronted offended the way hed been a couple times on the journey from cefnybedd in the van the seniorlooking whitehaired cop said bobby knew him called him ron as the back doors of the van flung open adrian turned looked at them didnt seem to see anyone it was all so absolutely right he insisted i couldnt get over how right it was they shoved him in the doors were slammed what did that mean bobby ron said a hand over one eye blood oozing between the fingers bobby demonstrated to ron how the rollright stones could be perfectly viewed in the gap no more than a foot wide between two of the whispering knights now with all the lights in the circle it looked almost too easy a target far closer than four hundred yards one megalithic site to another bobby said bang he sighed how many he got two shots off killed the vicar outright ron said one through the back another bloke caught one in the thigh so hell be ok ambulance on its way better take you too after we charge you that a joke lets bloody hope so stupid bastards whoever decided to put your name out they should be for the jump riggs still need a good explanation bloody hell hell have one he always has one so who called you out message from west mercia woman reported a body buried in concrete down near the welsh border hayonwye area funny name magda ring yeah after they see that body they start taking her a bit seriously mind you ron smiled ruefully if she hadnt given west mercia the name fraserhale and a photograph wed probably have let him go and pulled you for the lot bobby yes david a uniformed sergeant came over sir theres a bloke he coughed a bloke in a birdsuit of course there is ron said this is the rollright bloody stones tell him to piss off grayle saw bobby maiden grin it looked like it hurt two cops took her back to the circle nobody was allowed out of it despite the downpour just about everybody got searched charlies body had been covered up there were some cases of latent hysteria janny oates still unmarried was not among them two policewomen were with her under an umbrella she was entirely silent deep in shock drenched with blood and all of it charlies jesus grayle could only feel numb andy took marcus back inside made him lie on the study sofa malcolm across his feet checked him over for broken bones but marcus carried plenty of padding cheekbone was a possibility it was hard for him to talk which was a mercy for all of them he should be in hospital some chance round the back of the house vic showed her the body of a man called gallow some of his head had been blown away youre looking at contract boys vic said the hirings always done through a third party sorter thing maybe even a fourth party riggs wouldnt touch em with coaltongs these boys would never evenve heard the name riggs vic and andy both wore gloves for this vic did most of the carrying hed found some sacking in the barn and tied it round his waist with orange baler twine andy said so when riggs found out where bobby was thanks to my foolishness he took no steps at all to bring him in he just made a phone call prove it vic said word has it andy said that if you yourself turned queens evidence or whatever they call it enough stones might get turned over to open up a path direct to riggss door i helped fit up several small operators sure including dean my lad god rest him but that was for parker i wont drop parker in it of course andy said you wouldnaeve heard would you they put both bodies in the back of the white van they put the guns in too the sawnoff and the pistol vic had found near bezs body and used on gallow when he was about to kill marcus vic found the keys to the van in bezs pocket he said hed probably drive down the wye valley and dump the van somewhere near the severn bridge there was a mess of link roads around a halfbuilt industrial estate hed walk to the motorway services get himself a lift with a lorry driver to anywhere stay out of sight for a week or two maybe grab a holiday minehead or somewhere and youll think about what i said andy said ill think about it andy walked back to the farmhouse and wondered not for the seventeenth time what it would really be like living here li cold the stones prickly with frost she had to touch just once before she walked away dug her hands into coat pockets halloween night of the dead didnt seem like a good time for this but then it wasnt halloween any more what did they call the day after halloween was that all saints day or all souls day anyway the celtic new year cindy said so that was ok and a new moon too must count for something and im still here grayle thought what am i doing still here waiting for the start of some stupid ceremony to rehabilitate a pile of rocks the predawn wind was kicking at the grass rattling the gorse bushes there were no bad vibes around the place but no good vibes either just some old stones and a bunch of dysfunctional fruitcakes after two days of questions and statements and assuring them that shed return in good time for the trial grayle had left oxford in a fresh hire car theyd found the little red rover up against a field gate couple of hundred yards from the path to the whispering knights backed up ready to go another sign that adrian had seen no reason why he wasnt going to walk away from this at duncan murphys place grayle had spent a halfhour on the phone to her father she told him ersula was dead murdered by a cleanshaven nicely groomed oldfashioned wellspoken allround decent guy who loved his country then she burst into tears her father had not asked when she planned to return her father only ever had one daughter precisely what adrian fraserhale had done to ersula grayle did not at that time know soon the whole world would know somehow without quite figuring out why grayle had found herself driving west again tuesday night she was back in her depressing old room at the rams head in the village of st marys along the passage from an even crummier room occupied by one sydney marslewis i should go home she said to him in the bar that night but i feel so restless so dislocated so so goddamned angry a hundred years ago cindy was wearing his insouciant smile he would have been hanged and his body brought back and laid out on the capstone at black knoll so that everyone damaged by him could walk up and watch him rot would that have helped get outa here grayle had said now she looked at the high knoll burial chamber and thought maybe this was what they were about to do kind of someone put an arm around her waist she looked up into an eyepatch bobby maiden hadnt been back to elham hed been in hereford for two weeks engaged the whole time on the fraserhale case sitting in on the days of interviews with adrian who was cooperative and expansive and sometimes although never quite for maiden almost charming different people kept listening to the tapes load of balls armstrong would say periodically whichever way you look at it the fellers bloody mental armstrong being the detective superintendent in charge now because adrian was so polite and cooperative armstrong didnt hate adrian he hated cindy instead i dont understand where that mad welsh poof comes into it hed say every time maiden strongly suggested they consult cindy about some arcane issue relating to earthmagic armstrong hated having cindy in the same room seymour the forensic psychologist inflicted on the team hated having cindy in the same county dont worry about it lovely cindy said how would i have coped with all that fame at my age he did send one letter to superintendent armstrong it suggested they should never become blase or loosen the security around adrian fraserhale that they should be very careful about which police stations or remand centres he was to be held in which courtroom was to be used for his trial which prison or unit for the criminal insane was to house him for perhaps the rest of his life cindy advocated the use of an ordnance survey map and a ruler armstrong showed maiden the letter before he shredded it tell this old toerag if he pesters me again ill nick him for wasting police time maiden wondered whether he was going to quit the job officially before or after the court case but he still wanted riggs one night he had a call from mike beattie to say his car had been found in telford avenue jacked up on bricks all four wheels gone what did he want doing with it oh and had he heard old tony parker was no more sure hed heard it all from andy whod given herself either two weeks holiday or a nervous breakdown depending how elham general wanted to play it she was staying in the dairy cottage at castle farm to care for marcus who in maidens view was playing weaker than he actually was but not too weak to keep ringing maiden up in hereford asking if theyd arrested falconer yet unlikely falconer was coming over dumbfounded after all just look at the chap would you think he was capable does he look like a peter sutcliffe a charles manson a jeffrey dahmer a fred bloody west the university of the earth will quietly fade away magda ring predicted over a lunchtime drink in the rams head im expecting a lump sum from roger what i think is called a golden gag of course i could probably equal it were i to write the full story of roger and adrian for one of the sundays you really think he knew how much did he know is the only valid question i think he kept adrian like zoologists keep apes do you know what i mean they were going to write a book together you mean falconer was going to write a book about the adrian phenomenon and may still when hes had time to disentangle himself completely ill swing for the bastard first marcus said ah there you are lovelies cindy wore a long doublebreasted coat and a tan fedora no feathery cloak maiden said too cold brrrr cindy shook his arms bangles jangled oh while i remember he slid a small package into maidens jacket pocket there you are youve got everything now lovely what is it its the cassette we recorded on the knoll when you slept on the stone your dream tape do i want to hear it well cindy said the truth is most of it didnt come out i lied what that whole dream session you can call it a psychological placebo if you like but i am a shaman and i collected the soil and i believe anyway recorders and cameras and such items often do malfunction when something really quite significant is happening someone up there laughing at us there is however something about a lady under a streetlamp oh wow grayle said maiden smiled that was my mum interesting cindy said do expand well actually the truth of it came to me bizarrely when the fork lightning was coming down in the pines and fraserhale was firing and i was struggling to find the bloody gate in the railings and failing i didnt think about it again until last night your mothers death perhaps in the hitandrun my dad told me and the inquest that she obviously ran out to push me away from an oncoming lorry while he was at work and someone left the gate open not quite how it happened how old were you two i feel that what happened was that my mum was finally leaving the old man because hed hit her once too often hed dreamt about her again last night a sputtering lamp in old church street coming on going off a woman beneath it lit up for a strobing second a small woman in a light cardigan over a summer dress with bullseyes a small pale face curly hair held back with clips that often fell out claimed he wasnt there at the time but he was he came back maybe suspecting something and she was waiting at the bus stop with a small case and me she was taking me with her it was a very quiet lane almost in the country no immediate neighbours he got very angry he hit her she stumbled and that was when i ran out in the road how do you know this bobby bobby maiden gave him back the brown paper parcel containing the cassette tape how the hell should i know youre the bloody shaman a pale band had appeared in the eastern sky how you gonna handle this grayle wondered cindy seemed a little despondent id hoped for more people actually we need to demonstrate that things have changed six of us and all outsiders still we can but try so how cindy tapped his chin and his bangles rattled well for a start i thought it would be nice if one of us could go inside the chamber its collapsed annie managed it and of course the good sister anderson replaced a little weight since then fortunately for her i wonder who is the smallest of us now uhuh no way grayle said lets forget this right now i should never have even suggested it my apologies i simply thought that as only one of us has been permitted to see her it was am a thin amber line over the malvern hills hullo marcus said whats this a chain of lights coming up the rise ufos maybe grayle thought something for the phenomenologist shed been thinking a lot about the phenomenologist what a piece of crap it was although it didnt have to be a piece of crap with a little more cash behind it a redesign some real journalism stupid a pipe dream she didnt belong here quite a few of the buggers marcus noted andy said probably the entire hospital trust come to drag me back they came up the path taken cindy understood by annie davies herself on a morning when the castle ruins hung damply in the mist around the yard annie sliding through the scabbed and knobbly remains towards the pinkening light not this time of year of course there would have been no chill then it would be another hot day there were not a great many fewer than thered been at the funeral by the light of the torches cindy recognized several of those who had been in the pub when amy jenkins had broken the villages silence cindy spotted the old man in the flat cap the fat woman with the hat and the old woman with the funny eye and amy herself of course who would have rounded them up badgered cajoled blackmailed offered to wipe slates clean cindy met her at the edge of the knoll amy he said if i were a real man i should ask you to marry me bobby maiden spotted a familiar shabby figure looking slightly uncomfortable amongst all these yokels the lady in the pub said id find you here no other police around vic clutton said we need to talk mr maiden always happy to talk with you vic saved my life as i recall yeah vic said like this had only just occurred to him i did didnt i you heard about me saving anyone elses life at all wouldnt surprise me but no really no really no or any other incidents dont know what youre on about so theres no question of any of these incidents raising their ugly heads sorter thing in the future wouldnt be because of me because i havent heard of them right right erm that time you suggested riggs had dean strung up mmm maiden said i dont see us standing that one up either im afraid but there are other issues on which riggs might be put away and beattie and one or two others once you take away a few bricks in a jerrybuilt place like elham you know what i mean got you all right ill be in touch vic nodded and turned away be seeing you mr maiden dont go maiden said stay for our little rustic ritual illegal drinks afterwards at the tup all nice decent people oh except for marcus bacton the murderer with the capstone only inches above her the supporting stones on all sides and all the gaps between them blocked by the legs of the thirtyplus people standing in a circle around the monument it was dark as hell in here ersula was right the claustrophobia can be intense you start to scream inside all you want is out of there but like i said you have to stop your conscious mind getting a hold of you what you are dealing with here is the unconscious and that must be left to find its own route to what you would probably call enlightenment scary fun huh ersula however even without her coat she found it curiously warm she laid her head on her folded arms cindy was leading some kind of chant out there and it was kind of soporific maybe she fell asleep maybe she dreamed maybe she didnt when she awoke or didnt her left hand was like on fire and when she inched forward it was suddenly so bright on her face that she had to shut her eyes in a long long moment of amber radiance grayles body was suffused with a startling warmth now ok this was crazy by all the laws of prehistoric science this should not be happening because this was november and the chamber was supposed to be oriented to the midsummer sunrise the warmth settled around her like a fleece but very lightly and then she felt it inside her in the lowest part of her gut like good brandy she kept her eyes tight shut and lay very still this was no hardship in the closeness of the burial chamber on high knoll she felt she never wanted to move again that shed be quite happy to die here in this long ecstatic moment at the age of goddamn it nearly thirty and what had she done that was in any way worthwhile when she opened her eyes she found herself at the very end of the tunnel and what had seemed like a slit well because of the positioning of the stones and the peoples legs it was now wide enough to be almost a doorway she guessed that what had happened was that the capstone having collapsed had collapsed some more and the sun was coming in through some other slit whatever the sun was a glorious deep red made all the more intense by the frosty air the starkness of the trees youd swear it was coming down like just for her and annie davies bullshit grayle whispered uncertainly feeling somehow that she was not alone in here
