takes a thief mercedes lackey gerrup skifs dreams shattered leaving him with vague fragments of being somewhere warm cozy and sweetscented a toe scientifically applied to skifs rib cage with enough force to bounce him off the back wall of the understair cubby he called his own reinforced the otherwise incomprehensible order that he wake up he woke as ever stiff cold and with a growling stomach it was the beginning of another beautiful day at the hollybush tavern an good mornin to you too bastard he scrambled to his feet keeping hunched over to avoid hitting his head on the staircase his ratty scrap of a blanket clutched in both hands his uncles eldest son looked him up and down and grunted probably disappointed that skif was awake enough that a pickmeup cuff to the side of the head wasnt going to be necessary this time skif squinted kalchan was a monolithic silhouette against the smoky light from the open kitchen door narrower at the top and swiftly widening where shoulders would be on an ordinary human his only distinguishing characteristics from neck to knee being a pair of pillowlike arms and the fat bulging in rolls over his waistband skif couldnt see his face which was fine as far as he was concerned kalchans face was nothing he cared to examine closely under any circumstances breffuss kalchan grunted jerking his head over his shoulder so that his greasy locks swung in front of his face skif ducked his head and quickly folded his blanket dropping it on the pad of rags over straw that served him as a pallet he didnt need to dress in the winter he slept in every stitch of clothing he owned satisfied that skif was on duty kalchan went on to awaken the rest of the tavern staff yah an do not a hands worth of work neither breakfast was what kalchan had said but he hadnt meant that it was time for skif to partake of that meal as soon as he was out of the way skif scuttled out into the kitchen and began the tedious business of lighting the fires hindered by the fact that his uncles pennypinching ways were reflected in every aspect of his purchases for firewood he relied on the ragandbone men who swept out fireplaces and ovens in more prosperous households sifting out the ashes for sale to the tanners and soap makers and selling the clinkers and partiallyburned ends of logs to people like londer galko keeper of the hollybush tavern nor would uncle londer actually buy a decent firestarter much less keep a candle or banked coals going overnight skif had to make do with a piece of flint and one of some other rock the fact that at least half of this firewood had been doused with water which was in fact the law before the ragmen picked it up didnt make it any easier to light before he could do anything about a fire skif went to the pile of sweepings from the floor of the common room that hed collected last night after the last drunken lout had been rolled out the door every bit of dust and fluff that looked as if it might possibly catch fire became his tinder at worst case hed have to sacrifice a precious bit of the straw stuffed into his boots for warmth heh sommun been trackin in straw hayseed from country prolly oh ayah here be nice dust bunny too swearing under his breath skif hacked his two bits of rock together trying to generate sparks hoping one of them would land in the tiny patch of lint and fluff when one finally did and finally cooperated with his efforts he coaxed it into a tiny flame then got the flame to take hold of the driest of the wood he nursed it tenderly sheltering it from the drafts along the floor begging it to take finally he set it on the sooty hearth surrounded it with what was left of the dry wood from last night and slowly fed it until it was large enough to actually cook over only when the kitchen fire was properly started did the slattern used by uncle londer as a cook dishwasher and general dogsbody finally shuffle down the stairs from the loft where she slept into the room scratching head and buttocks at the same time without ever dislodging any of the vermin who called her home skif often wondered why so few people who ate here died perhaps it was only because their stomachs were already full of the acidic potions his uncle sold as wine and beer and once a stomach was full of that rotgut nothing that came in from the food lived long enough to cause sickness the kitchen door stood open to the cold courtyard kalchan came in that way every morning bringing the days supplies uncle londer never bought more of anything for the inn than he absolutely had to now skif braced himself to head outside into the cold where ud it hurt if e bought for a week wouldn e get it cheaper that way skif ran out into the courtyard to unload the wagon hired for the purpose by the candlemark together with a boy to drive it the quicker skif unloaded the thing the less uncle londer would be charged and if he didnt save uncle londer every possible pennybit hed learn about it when kalchans fist connected with his head the boy stared at the ears of his donkey studiously ignoring skif who was so much lower in the social scale than he was this boy had a coat new boots both clean ah stuck up skif thought and stuck out his tongue at the unresponsive back first off a halfsack of flour followed by a tub of tallow grease thriftily saved from cookshops where they skimmed off the grease from roasting and frying and resold to those who could not afford butter and candles maisie would be put to taking peeled rushes and dipping them in the melted grease to make the tallow dips that served the tavern as lights and the cook would use the same grease in baking and on the bread skif moved it carefully and set it down beside the flour sometimes the stuff was still liquid underneath and he didnt dare spill it then came a bucket of meat scraps which would serve for the soup and meat pies i don wanna know what that meat came from reckon it might meow next a peck of withered spotty turnips another of dried beans and peas that were past their best and smelled of mold last of all two barrels of beer and one of wine both represented the collected dregs from barrels all over the city collected last night from one of the large merchants who supplied goods to other inns and taverns needless to say this was the cheapest conceivable form of beverage it even cost less than the sweet spring water collected from outside haven it was so awful that guild cooks wouldnt even use the stuff in sauces stale and loaded with sediment it smelled sour even through the wood of the barrel skif got the barrels off the wagon quickly and the boy turned the wagon just as quickly and sent his donkey trotting out into the street skif lugged the food into the kitchen where old moll the cook took charge of it all only she or kalchan were allowed to touch the food and drink once it came off the wagon skif had no intention of touching any of it he never ate here not that uncle londer encouraged him to he wasnt done yet he had to bring in enough water from the courtyard pump to fill the halfbarrel in the kitchen one bucket at a time he stumbled on the rutted frozen dirt of the courtyard his boots stuffed with straw for extra warmth were far too big for him he didnt care better too big than too small leastwise they don pinch now skif went out into the common room to ready it for the first customers lighting the fire there with a brand from the kitchen fire arranging bits of wood on either side of the hearth to dry taking the benches down off the tables and the shutters off the windows the oiled paper in the windows didnt do a great deal to keep out the cold but with snow in the street outside there was some light getting in this morning so it was just as well that oiled paper hindered more than it helped in that direction skif would never want to see what the common room looked like in the full light of the sun as horrible as the food and drink here in the hollybush were there were two customers waiting for skif to open the door he knew them both by sight two men who would down a minimum of six mugs of foul beer and choke down a slice of stale burned bread with a scraping of nameless fat before shambling off somewhere not to be seen until the next morning presumably they had jobs somewhere and this was their breakfast they slumped down on the benches nearest the door and skif yelled for maisie the fourth member of uncle londers tavern staff as usual she emerged from her own cubby of a blockedup stair that once led to the second floor which unlike skifs had a flap of patched canvas for a door followed by kalchan as usual she said nothing only scuttled into the kitchen for the customers beer and bread her face set in a perpetual mask of fear kalchan hitched at his trews and grinned showing yellowed teeth and followed her into the kitchen skif shuddered as awful as his position was here maisies was worse this was a tavern not an inn and the kitchen and common room were all there was of the place the tenement rooms upstairs although they belonged to uncle londer were not available for overnight guests but were rented by the month there was a separate entrance to the rooms via a rickety staircase in the courtyard this limited the tenants access to the inn and the fuel and food kept there uncle fully expected his tenants to pilfer anything they could lay their hands on and they responded to his trust by doing so at every possible opportunity not that there were many opportunities kalchan saw to that now skif was free to leave at last for the lessons that every child was required by valdemar law to have until he was able to read write and cipher not even uncle londer had been able to find a way to keep skif from those lessons much as he would have liked to skif didnt wait around for permission from kalchan to leave or his cousin would find something else for him to do and make him late if he was late hed miss breakfast which would certainly please kalchans sadistic notion of what was amusing see ya but not till dark greaseball he shot out the door without a backward look into the narrow street this was not an area that throve in the morning those who had jobs were usually at them by dawn and those who didnt were generally out looking for something to put some money in their pockets at least that early or were sleeping off the results of drinking the vile brews served in the hollybush or other endofthealley taverns the hollybush was in fact located at the end of the alley giving uncle londer the benefit of giving custom no chance to stumble past his door there were other children running off up the alley to lessons as well though not all to the same place as skif he had to go farther than they constrained by his uncles orders if skif was going to have to have lessons his uncle was determined at least that he would take them where uncle londer chose and nowhere else every child in this neighborhood was running eagerly to their various teachers for the same reason that skif did free and edible breakfast this was an innovation of queen selenays who had decided based on her own observation that a hungry child doesnt learn as well as one with food in his belly so every child in haven taking lessons who arrived on time was supplied with a bacon roll and a mug of tea in winter or a buttered roll and a piece of fruit in summer both came from royal distribution wagons that delivered the supplies every morning so there was no use in trying to cheat the children by scrimping but if a child was late he was quite likely to discover that his attendance had been given up for the day and someone else had eaten his breakfast so there was ample incentive to show up on time if not early for those lessons however difficult or boring a child might find them skif had no intention of missing out on his share his stomach growled as he ran and he licked his lips in anticipation unless luck went his way this might be the only really edible food hed get for the rest of the day and there was no doubt in his mind that the rest of the children in his group were in the same straits the narrow twisting streets he followed were scarcely wide enough for a donkey cart the tenement houses three stories tall including the attics leaned toward the street as if about to fall into it there was not enough traffic to have worn away the packed dirty snow heaped up against the walls of the houses on either side and no incentive for the inhabitants to scrape it away so there it would remain accumulating over the course of the winter until it finally thawed and soaked into the dirt of the street turning it to mud but that would not be for several moons yet there was all of the winter to get through first at least the cold kept down the smell from backyard privies chicken coops pigeon houses pig sties the poor tried to eke out their meager foodstuffs any way they could pigeons were by far the most popular since they could fly away by day to more prosperous parts of town and feed themselves at someone elses expense there were clouds of them on every available perch sitting as close together as possible for warmth and whitening the broken slates and shingles of the rooftops with their droppings of course with all the snow up there the droppings were invisible in winter skif was finally warm now his breath puffing out whitely as he ran he had no coat of course but no child in his neighborhood had a coat there were three ways to get warm in the winter work until you were warm do something that kept you near enough to the fire that you werent freezing or be as creative about finding warmth as skif was after six turnings he was in a slightly more respectable neighborhood the streets were marginally wider a halfhearted attempt to remove the snow had been made and there were a few dark little shops on the first floors of the tenement houses more chimneys sported thin streams of smoke and at the end of this final street just before it joined one of the main thoroughfares was the temple of belden it wasnt a large temple as such things went it had only four priests and a halfdozen novices but the order of belden was a charitable order which was just as well since there wasnt much scope for anything but charity down here as such one of the charitable acts performed here was to educate the poor children of the area but skif wasnt here because he had chosen the place or even because uncle londer had picked it from a number of options he was here because his second cousin the middle son of his uncles brood of three was a novice here cousin beel had as little choice about his vocation as skif did uncle londer wished to impress his social superiors with his sense of charity and so beel became a novice beel seemed to like the life though or he liked it as much as this curiously colorless young man could like anything beel was as forgettable as kalchan was remarkable skif pushed open a little side door in the chapter house next to the temple the door opened directly into a public room with several tables and benches in it there were thirty or forty other children that took lessons there and about half of them were already sitting on the benches waiting for their meal skif slid in beside one of the smaller girls a tiny bigeyed thing called dolly she smiled up at him in welcome he was her protector and kept her from being harassed by any of the more aggressive children who would try to bully her outside of classes for anything that they thought they could get from her he took her cold little hands in his and held them until they warmed while they waited for the last of the children to straggle in skif heard her stomach growl while they waited his answered hers and she gave a little giggle finally a small bell rang somewhere in the temple marking the end of the first service and a door at the back of the room opened beel and one other novice entered carrying baskets the delicious aroma of bacon wafted gently to where skif sat trying not to fidget every eye in the room was riveted on those baskets as beel and the other novice left and returned with steaming pots of tea and thick clay mugs cor can they move any slower it seemed an eternity before the last of the paraphernalia of breakfast finally was brought in and arranged to beels liking only then were the children permitted to come up to him one at a time and receive their rolls and mugs by then of course the rolls were stone cold and the tea at best lukewarm it didnt matter so long as the rolls werent frozen hard as stones so long as the tea wasnt a block of ice there wasnt a child here that wouldnt devour every crumb and drink down every drop some of them began eating and drinking while they walked back to their places but not skif and not dolly either for she followed his example it wasnt for the sake of manners skif didnt have any no more than any of the others it was because he had figured out that if he ate over the table he could catch every crumb and he did when they were done he and dolly licked their fingers and picked up the tiniest fragments from the wood lukewarm as the tea was it was still warmer than the room the mug served double duty as a hand warmer until the tea was gone they werent allowed to linger over it though not with two novices standing over them then beels fellow novice collected the empty mugs and vanished leaving beel to his teaching duties skif should in fact not be here at all he read and wrote as well as any of the children at these tables and the law said only that children had to be able to read write and figure to a certain level before their compulsory education was complete not at what age a child could be released skif enjoyed reading and even took a certain aesthetic pleasure in writing it would have been hard for him to feign being bad at either beel probably would have quickly caught on before long and sent him back to the tavern where hed quickly be slaving for kalchan and doing without his breakfast but figuring had never come easy to him and it was boring besides he still couldnt add two numbers of two figures each and come up with the same answer twice in a row and in all likelihood neither answer would be the right one needless to say although he pretended that he was trying his progress was glacial he had to make some progress of course or even beel would suspect something but he was going to put off the evil day when beel would pronounce his education complete for as long as he could in the meantime since he was so good at reading and writing during those lessons beel saw no reason why he should not take some of the workload off of his own shoulders and skif was put to tutoring the youngest children including dolly he didnt mind he was big enough to be able to bully those who werent at all interested in learning things and beel had no objection to his delivering admonitory cuffs to the ear if it became necessary to keep discipline that was the main thing that was hard about being the tutor littles like dolly who wanted to learn just needed some help over the rough spots it was turn and turn about then and time for one of the other boys to tutor skif along with children three years his junior in figures for skif this was the worst part of the day and not because he himself was a discipline problem being anywhere other than the tavern was an improvement and he wasnt eager to get himself kicked out it was horribly cold in this room there was a fire but it didnt get things much above freezing and by now they were all suffering from icy hands and feet he was bored and breakfast had long since worn thin only in summer was this part of the day bearable for as cold as the temple buildings were in winter they made up for it by being pleasant in summer and smelled of ancient incense rather than the reek of privies of garbage and of the muck of all of the animals hidden away in back courts there the heads of every child in the room skifs included came up as the bell summoning the faithful to midday service rang from the top of the temple if theyd been a pack of dogs their ears and tails would have quivered novice beel sighed all he began and the children literally leaped from their seats and stampeded for the door before he could finish right skif heard faintly behind him as he scooped up dolly and shoved his way with the rest through the open door with her held protectively in front of him once outside he broke away from the mob of children bringing dolly with him the rest streamed in every direction and skif hadnt a clue what made them all so anxious to get where they were heading to do so at a run maybe it was the prospect of finding a little warmth somewhere without a word he wrapped his arm around dollys thin shoulders and turned her in the direction of her home since a few days after her first appearance in the schoolroom when hed caught some of the older children teasing and tormenting her hed played her guardian her father brought her in the morning on the way to his work at the docks but skif was her escort home where she would join the rest of the children in her family and her mother at their laundry in winter despite having to struggle with soaking heavy fabric and harsh soap that irritated and chapped the skin a laundry wasnt a bad place to work since you could always warm up in the room where the washing coppers were kept hot over their fires dolly never lingered once they arrived she only cast skif a shy smile of thanks and scampered inside the building where a cloud of steam poured out into the street from the momentarily open door his selfappointed duty complete skif was now free for as long as he could keep out of the way of his relatives kalchan would work him until he dropped not serving customers since that was maisies job but doing everything else but cooking and everything else included some things that made skif feel sick just to think about on the other hand out of sight was definitely out of mind with kalchan and so long as skif didnt claim meals his eldest cousin probably thought he was in lessons during the daylight hours fortunately beel had suffered enough under his older brothers fist as a child that he didnt go out of his way to enlighten kalchan as to skifs whereabouts out of school that did leave him some options sometimes he could find someone with errands to run sometimes he could shovel snow or sweep crossings for a pennybit there was refuse to haul off for the ragandbone men if they came up short a man but none of that was to be counted on as a source of food or money to buy it and skif had finally hit on something that was it took him far out of his own neighborhood and into places where his ragged coatless state was very conspicuous that was the drawback before he reached his goal he might be turned back a dozen times by suspicious folk who didnt like the look of him in their clean and prosperous streets eventually he left the tenements and crooked foul streets and penetrated into places where the streets were clean and kept clean by people whose only job was to sweep them the transition was amazing to him and even more amazing was that there were single families that lived in buildings that would serve to house a dozen or more families in his area he didnt even try to venture onto those streets there were all sorts of people there whose only job was to keep people like him out now he went to the alleys slinking from bit of cover to bit of cover there was plenty of cover here permanent rubbish bins where ashes broken crockery bits of wood scraps from food preparation too small or too spoiled for anyone from these houses to consider useful were left for the rubbish collectors this was where the wood and possibly some of the foodstuffs bought by uncle londer came from skif knew better than to rummage in those bins they belonged to the rubbish collectors who guarded their territories jealously with curses kicks and blows but the rubbish collectors didnt care who they saw in their alleys so long as he left the bins alone and they ignored skif as if he was invisible sometimes there were other things left back here as well usually weeds bags of dead plants and leaves sticks and trimmings from gardens it all made places for a small boy like skif to hide these alleys were faced by blank walls that rose well above skifs head but not all of those walls were as impervious as they seemed he had skipped over three or four social strata now hed known better than to look for a mark among people like dollys parents or the small merchants such folk feared to lose what theyd built up and were as penurious in their way as his uncle they didnt share what they had and when they caught someone trying to get a bit for himself punished him with fury no when skif decided that he was going to help himself to the bounty of others he knew hed need to find someone who had so much that he couldnt keep track of it all and so many servants that it wasnt possible even for them to do so the drawback was that in such a rich household there were privileges that were jealously guarded and as he knew very well even those things that the owner thought were refuse had value the cook and her staff all had the rights to such things as fat skimmed from the cooking the burned or otherwise spoiled bits and broken meats which last were cooked leftover items that had been cut into or served from without actually having been on someones plate depending on the household unless such items were designated to go to the poor the cook and helpers could sell such items from the back door or give them to relatives who were less wellprovidedfor or a combination of all of these things scrapings the leftovers scraped from plates into a slop bucket by the dishwashers belonged to the dishwashers in some households or were fed to household animals in others and again could be sold or carried off if not fed to animals stale bread and cake were the provenance of the pastry cook sometimes a different entity from the head cook who had the same options all these leftover items were jealously guarded from the time they became leftovers but from the time they left the hands of the cooks until the moment that they were brought back to the kitchen no one was paying any great amount of attention to the quantities on platters in a socalled great household and that was where skif had found his little opportunity to exploit the situation he noted the first breach in the defenses by the cloud of sweetscented steam rising over the wall this was a huge household that had its own laundry making sure that he wouldnt be spotted he kicked off his boots and hid them inside the wall squeezing them in through a place where hed found a loose brick it had occurred to him more than once that he was probably using someone elses hiding place bricks in welltended walls like this one didnt just come loose by accident he wouldnt be the least surprised to learn that someone or several someones in this great house had once used the place to store small articles purloined in the course of duties to be retrieved and carried off later now barefooted he climbed nimbly over the top and into the open laundry yard full of vats of hot water bleaches and soap in which household linens soaked before being pounded by a dozen laundresses rinsed and hung up to dry between the vats sheets and towels were strung on lines crisscrossing the yard the bleaches were so harsh that these vats were kept in the open and away from the rest of the laundry where the clothing was cleaned for a careless splash could ruin a colored tunic forever the steam and the hanging linens gave him cover to get into the room where the livery for the pages was stored once it had been laundered and on his way through he grabbed a wet towel out of one of the vats to take with him the pages there were at least twenty of them went through a dozen sets of livery apiece in a week for the servant who had charge over them insisted on absolute cleanliness this room which they called a closet although it was as big as the hollybushs common room held only shelves that were stacked with tabbards tunics and trews for every possible size of boy they didnt wear boots or shoes perhaps because they were so young that they would probably outgrow boots or shoes too quickly instead they wore colored stockings with leather bottoms which could fit a wide variety of feet hence skifs current barefoot status the rest of the livery was designed to be oversized on practically any child so skif would have no difficulty in fitting into whatever was clean within moments his own clothing was hidden under piles of discarded but clean tabards too worn to be used for anything but really dirty jobs but too good to be relegated to duty as rags a quick wipe all over himself with the damp towel a dirty boy would stand out dreadfully among the clean pages and a quick change of clothing and skif was now a page just in time for luncheon now properly outfitted and hence invisible to the rest of the staff he dropped the filthy towel in a pile of others waiting to be cleaned trotted out of the laundry just as if he was on an errand he crossed a paved court to the kitchens slipped inside the door and joined the line of pages bringing common food into the lords great hall he made certain to take a platter heavily laden with a pile of what looked like boiled baby cabbages no bigger than his thumb by the time it got to the table two of them were in his pockets this lord orthallen must be a very important person every day he entertained a horde of people at his table perhaps fifty or sixty of them besides the dozen or so of his own immediate family that was just guests there was a small army of his own servants and retainers at still lower tables but they had to serve themselves from great bowls and platters brought from the kitchen by one of their own number skif and the other pages served only the guests who got foods that were designed to be eaten with ones own knife and hands after the tiny cabbages he purloined a dainty little coinsized meat pie a soft roll of white bread a cube of cheese more cheese wrapped in pastry a small boiled turnip and an apple that was all his pockets would hold he made certain that he was in the procession of pages that got the platters going to those who sat below the lords salt he didnt have the manners to serve at the head table and he knew that hed be recognized for an interloper those who sat lower were too busy eating gossiping and watching their betters to pay attention to the pages once his pockets were full skif made certain to accidentally get some grease on the front of his tabard an accident that occurred to at least three of the pages at every meal since many of them were young and they were all rushing to and fro as he expected he was sent to the laundry to change once there he swiftly changed back into his own clothing left the soiled uniform with others like it and went back up but not over the walls and into the alleys after all why should he he had nothing particular to do out there his friends were all too busy working or on schemes of their own to get themselves fed to have any time for play playing was what the fortunate children of the rich did for the moment he wanted a warm place to rest and eat and there was one right here at hand there was an attic over the laundry a loft area that was barely tall enough to allow him to walk hunched over where old tubs and some of the laundry stores were kept it got more than enough heat from the laundry below to be comfortably cozy and more than enough steam to keep down the dust here skif curled up inside an overturned wooden tub for extra concealment and dug into his purloined food he could of course have eaten three times what hed stolen but it was twice what hed get at the tavern and not only entirely edible but tasty to boot with his stomach relatively full he curled up in the tub for a nap here and not in his cubby at the hollybush was where he could sleep in comfort and security and he did no matter how comfortable he was skif slept like a cat with one eye open and one ear cocked in case trouble stole upon him thinking to catch him unaware so even though he didnt know what woke him when he woke he came alert all at once and instead of jumping to his feet he stayed frozen in place listening wood creaked slightly somewhere in the loft was it a footstep the sound came again a trifle nearer then fabric brushed against something harder there was someone up here with him now it wouldnt be one of the laundry servants on proper business they came up the stair clumping and talking loudly it might be a servant or a page come up here to nap or escape work if it was although skif would have a slight advantage in that the other wouldnt want to be caught he had a profound disadvantage in that he didnt belong here himself and the other could legitimately claim to have heard something overhead and gone to investigate if that was the case hed be stuck under this tub until the other person left it might also be something and someone entirely different a thief who wouldnt want to be found any more than skif did who might flee or might fight depending on the circumstances if skif came out of hiding he didnt know enough yet better to wait it was highly unlikely that the other would choose skifs particular tub to hide himself or anything else underneath it was out of the way and smallish and skif had chosen it for precisely those reasons instead he peered under the edge of it as the surreptitious sounds moved closer thanking his luck that it wasnt dusty up here now would be a bad time to sneeze it sounded given the direction the sounds were coming from as if the unknown had gotten into the loft the same way that skif had through the gable window at the end skif narrowed his eyes waiting for something to come into his area of vision among the slats of the wooden tubs the light was surprisingly good up here but the sun was all wrong for skif to see a shadow that might give him some notion of who the other intruder was the creaking gave skif a good idea that the fellow moved toward the stairs which meant he was at least thinking of using them to descend into the laundry itself that wasnt an option skif would have chosen unless of course the fellow was a thief and was planning on purloining something from the laundry itself there was plenty of stuff to steal in there silk handkerchiefs and scarves the embroidered ribbons that the young ladies of the household liked to use for their necks and hair and the young men liked to give them the gossamer veils they wore in public all light easy to carry presumably easy to sell the only reason skif hadnt helped himself before this was that he didnt know where to dispose of such things and was not about to share his loot with kalchan a foot slid slowly into view not a big foot and most importantly of all not a foot clad in the soled sock of a page or liveried indoor servant this was a foot in a halfboot of very flexible black leather laced tight to the ankle and calf much worn and patched not much larger than his own attached to a leg in rusty black trews with worn places along the hem this foot and the person who wore those trews did not belong here no one in lord orthallens service wore anything of the sort skif made a quick decision and struck before the other knew he was there skifs hand darted from under the tub and skif had the fellows ankle held fast in a hand that was a lot stronger than it looked skif had half expected a struggle or at least an attempt to get free but the owner of the ankle had more sense than that or was more afraid of the attention that the sounds of a struggle would bring than anything skif could do to him so now it was the others turn to freeze skif mentally applauded his decision he thought he had a good idea of what was going through the other fellows mind now the arm that skif had snaked out from beneath the tub was clad in a sleeve that was more patch than whole cloth so skif obviously didnt belong here either and the two of them were at an equal advantage and disadvantage for either to make noise or fuss would mean that both would be caught and no point in trying to claim that one had seen the other sneak over the wall and followed to catch him either an honest boy would have pounded on the back entrance to report the intruder not climbed up after him no no if one betrayed the other both of them would be thrown to the city guard so the other fellow did the prudent thing he stayed in place once skif let go of him so that skif could slip out from under the tub like it or not for the moment they were partners in crime skif however had a plan there was a moment when the other could have tried to knock skif out and make a run for it but he didnt such an action would have been noisy of course and he still might have been caught but with one unconscious or semiconscious boy on the floor to distract those who would come clambering up here he might have been able to get away skif breathed a sigh of relief when he was all the way out from under the tub and was able to kneel next to it looking up at the interloper what he saw was a boy of about fifteen but small for his age so that he wasnt a great deal taller than skif his thin face as closed and impassive as any statues gave away no hint of what he was thinking his eyes narrowed when he got a good look at his captor but there was no telling what emotion lay behind the eyes his clothing was better than skifs but then again whose wasnt skif wore every shirt he owned three all ragged all inexpertly patched by his own hands all faded into an indeterminate brown with a knitted tunic that was more hole than knit over the top of it all his linen trews patched as well were under his woolen trews which for a change had been darned except for the seat which sported a huge patch made from an old canvas tent this boys clothing was at least all the same color and the patches were of the same sort of material as the original in fact unless you were as close as skif was you wouldnt notice the patches much he had long hair of a middling brown color and a headband of dark braided string to keep it out of his eyes his eyes matched his hair and if hed been fed as well as one of the page boys his face would have been round as it was the bones showed clearly though not nearly as sharply defined as skifs there were other signs of relative prosperity the other boys wrists werent as thin as skifs and he showed no signs of the many illnesses that the poor were prone to in the winter if he was a thief and there was little doubt in skifs mind that he was this boy was a good enough thief to be doing well the two of them stared at each other for several moments it was the older boy who finally broke the silence wot ye want he asked in a harsh whisper until that moment when hed seized the others ankle skif hadnt known what he wanted but the moment his hand had touched leather his plan had sprung up in his mind teach me he whispered and saw with satisfaction the boys eyes widen with surprise then his slow nod he squatted down beside skif who beckoned to him to follow on hands and knees skif led him into the maze of tubs and empty packing crates until they were hidden from view against the wall next to the chimney there they settled screened by stacks of buckets needing repair from below came the steady sounds of the laundry which should cover any conversation of theirs ye aint no page an ye aint got no reason tbe in the wash house wot ye doin here the boy asked more curious than annoyed skif shrugged same as you only not so good he replied he explained his ruse to get fed to the boy whose lips twitched into a thin smile not bad done fer a little he acknowledged noboddie never pays mind tlittles ye cud do better though real work not this pilferin bits uv grub i kin get through places a mun cant an ye kin get where i cant we might cud work tgether thats why i want ye tteach me skif whispered back cant keep runnin this ferever won look like no page much longer the boy snorted wont need to here shake ont he held out his hand a thin hard and strong hand and skif took it cementing their bargain with a shake mnames deek the boy said releasing his hand skif was happy to note that deek hadnt tried to crush his hand in his grip or otherwise show signs of being a bully call me skif he offered deek grinned good now you stay here i come back in a tick an well scoot out by th back tgether he cocked his head down at the floor and it was pretty clear that there wasnt anyone working down in the laundry anymore it was probably time for supper the laundresses and some of the other servants ate long before their betters and went to bed soon after sundown for their work started before sunrise skif nodded he saw no reason to doubt that deek would play him false since he was sitting on the only good route of escape he and deek made their way back to skifs tub skif ducked back inside and deek crept down the stairs into the laundry deek came back up quickly and the quick peek of silk from the now slightlybulging breast of his tunic told skif all he needed to know as he had expected deek had managed to slip downstairs purloin small items of valuable silk and get back up without anyone catching sight of him as long as he took small things items unlikely to be missed for a while that werent such rare dainties as to be too recognizable it was quite likely that the owners themselves would assume theyd been mislaid no specially embroidered handkerchiefs for example or unusual colors of veils he beckoned to skif who followed him out over the roof both of them lying as flat as stalking cats as they wiggled their way along the tiles to minimize the chance of someone spotting them from below from this position they couldnt see much just the lines of drying linens in the yard the tops of bushes past the linens that marked the gardens and the bulk of the magnificent mansion beyond if anyone looked out of the windows of the mansion they would be spotted not likely though the pipeclay tiles were infernally cold after the warm washhouse attic and skif clenched his teeth together to keep them from chattering as he slid bellydown along them they kept finding tears and rents to protrude through right against his bare skin the edges of the tiles caught on his rags too he had to move carefully and make sure that nothing had snagged as he moved to keep from dislodging one of them and sending it down with a betraying clatter it seemed to be getting a little darker although the sky was so overcast that skif couldnt tell where the sun was that was good the closer it was to dusk the less likely anyone would see them already his bare feet ached with cold the most risky part of this procedure was the moment that they got down from the roof onto the top of the wall the roof actually overhung the wall so that they had to dangle over the alley and feel with their toes for their support and of course this put them in clear view of anyone in the alley but as skif already knew it was too early for scrap collectors and too late for the ragandbone men too late for tradesmen and too early for those delivering special items that lord orthallens cooks did not have the expertise to prepare in time for an evenings feast there was no one in the alley deek went first skif followed he slipped his legs over the edge of the roof and lowered himself down hanging on grimly to the lead gutters groping after the rough stone of the wall somewhere underneath the overhang with his benumbed toes when he finally got his feet on it and set them solidly he eased himself down and under the overhang his arms hurting with the strain deek crouched there waiting for him with great patience and he paused for just a moment to shake some feeling back into his fingers from the wall they climbed down to the alleyway skif noted with concealed glee that deek came down the same route that he himself used wait a mo he said as deek made to move off and retrieved his boots from the hidden nook deeks mouth dropped open cor that be right handy that do he whispered in amazement skif just grinned and shoved his boots on quickly they still couldnt afford to be caught here someone might search them deek wasted no more time but led skif off in the opposite direction from which skif had come he didnt go that way for long however just far enough to get back into a more modest area then he cut back in the direction that skif had expected he didnt slow down not for a moment and skif had to stretch his legs to keep up with him for all that he didnt look like a boy who was somewhere he shouldnt be he strode with his head up paying close attention to anything that stood out like a landmark quite as if he had an errand hed been sent on skif tried to emulate him as they worked their way back toward the south and east deek started to talk quietly enough so that it wasnt likely theyd be overheard sjest me an a couple boys an bazie deek said bazie hes the clever cuz what tells us how tnobble caint do it hisself aint got no legs but e kin show us an he innerduced us tthe fence so we gotta place tsell the swag he gonna have a prollem with me skif wanted to know deek shook his head nah he said decisively we bin one short since larap tookt off on is own no flop an no feed though he added casting a look aside at skif not lessen ye bin wi th gang a sixmun gotta flop skif replied shortly an i kin feed mself i kin wait but secretly he was astonished at his good luck that he even had a chance for a new place to sleep and meals if he could just get out of uncle londers clutches anything would be better than the hollybush deek laughed and slapped skif on the back as they turned a corner and entered a workingclass neighborhood where they could leave the alleys and take to the streets this wasnt one anywhere near the hollybush and skif wondered just how far they were from the tavern far i hope he thought don want kalchan catchin wind uv this each turning that deek made took them deeper into the kind of areas that skif called home though nothing looked familiar the streets grew narrower the buildings shabbier and in worse repair another corner turned and they came unexpectedly into a little square where there was a market going at full shout with barrows and stalls everywhere deek ignored the noise the hagglers the confusion of people and barrows he pushed in between a ragandbone man selling bundles of halfburned wood and a barrow full of broken and cracked pottery leading skif into a narrow passage between two buildings not much bigger than his own slim shoulders then with an abrupt turn in the half dark he darted into an opening in one wall and up a staircase skif followed taking care where he put his feet for there was plenty of debris on the rickety wooden stairs some of it slippery the stairs were steep and switched back and forth with landings on each floor that led to two or three closed doors at the top however there was only a single door which deek opened without knocking skif followed him inside only to be confronted by a long hallway with more doors lit from above by a single skylight with some translucent stuff in it that let in enough light to make out the doorways deek went straight to the end of the hall much to skifs bafflement there was nothing there but the blank wall an expanse of waterstained plaster with a couple of old rusted hooks on it deek paused at the end and grinned back over his shoulder at skif figger it out yet he taunted then pulled on a hook a door separated itself from the cracked plaster the lines of the door previously completely hidden in the cracks deek motioned to skif to go inside and closed the door behind him now they went down a stair more of a ladder than a staircase one somehow sandwiched between the walls of buildings on all four sides and in a moment skif realized that this must be an air shaft and at some point someone had juryrigged a stair inside it there were windows looking into the shaft but most of them had shutters over them to keep out the cold air they climbed down and down until they passed through the bottom of the shaft and skif knew that they were below street level if he hadnt already guessed that the sudden increase in dampness would have given it away there was a door at the bottom of the stair deek knocked on this one in a definite pattern that skif didnt quite catch the door swung open and deek grabbed his arm and pulled him inside another boy this one older than deek with hair of a mousy blonde color closed the door behind them skif stood at deeks side and took it all in without saying a word it was warm down here warm and humid the source of the warmth was a copper wash boiler which was also the source of the moisture it sat in a brickwork oven in the far corner of the stonewalled room a chimney running up the corner behind it with a fine fire burning beneath it and presumably laundry soaking in it hanging just below the ceiling were strings of drying wash silk objects hung there expensive silk mostly scarves and handkerchiefs a few veils some ladys stockings and finelyknit silk gloves and a few perfectly ordinary shirts and tunics and trews stockings all darned and patched well hey if theyre washin the swag they mights well wash their own stuff i guess the fire beneath the cauldron despite the name of wash boiler was not hot enough to boil the water only to keep it warm next to the cauldron was a remarkable figure seated on a stack of flat cushions busily darning the heel of a silk stocking with fingers as fine and flexible as a womans he was bald shinypated in fact with enormous shoulders and chest muscles beneath a shabby tunic the legs of his equally patched trews were folded under at the knee as deek had implied he didnt look up from his work there were two more boys in the room one stirring the laundry with a stick the other cracking and peeling hardboiled eggs at an old table with one broken leg propped up and crudely nailed to an old keg skif tried not to look at the eggs his pilfered lunch had long since worn thin besides the table and the stool the boy sat on of furnishings there were none there were boxes in various states of repair old kegs halfbarrels and a wide variety of cushions quilts and other linens anything that was made of fabric unlike the rest of the contents of the room was neatly patched and darned and in good repair and clean very clean there was plenty of light here from a motley assortment of lamps and candles and there was definitely one thing missing the usual smell of poverty compounded of dirt mildew grease mouse and sweat the man finished his darning and with a gusty sigh tossed the stocking in with the rest of the laundry in the wash boiler only then did he look up his eyes a startling black seemed to bore right into skifs brain where ye get thisun he asked deek turning his gaze on skifs companion if deek had possessed such a thing as a cap hed probably have snatched it off and held it diffidently in front of him in both hands as it was he ducked his head e caught me bazie deek told the man e wuz in th washhouse loft an e caught me cummin in then having gotten the difficult bit over with admitting that hed been caught by a mere child he continued with more enthusiasm describing skifs own lay and his wish to be taught the other two boys pretended not to listen but skif caught them watching him surreptitiously figgered e cud take laraps place mebbe if n e makes it past sixmun deek concluded looking hopefully at his mentor now bazie transferred his unwavering gaze to skif ye livin rough he asked and skif knew that hed better tell the truth at hollybush he replied shortly kalchans mcuz londers mnuncle evidently bazie knew the hollybush since he didnt ask where or what it was his gaze became even more piercing bonded with relief skif shook his head nuhuh he denied vigorously ma didn bond me fore she croaked londers pretty het bout it but aint nothin e kin do now an e niver cud put me out cuz e took me in on th rolls an all reckonin t get me bonded a bonded child was just short of property required to serve in whatever capacity his guardian chose until he was sixteen for the privilege of being sheltered and fed skifs mother had neglected perhaps on purpose to bond her toddler to her brother when her man left her and she fell ill she worsened and died before londer could get the bond signed and sworn to it was too late now no notary would swear to a faked bond well no notary would swear to a faked bond for the pittance of a bribe that was all that londer would offer by the point when skifs mother died londer was already on record with the same temple beel served at as the responsible party for his sister and nephew hoping to get skifs bond as such he was technically required by law to care for skif until the age of twelve without any benefit at twelve which was no more than a couple of years away he could turn skif out but he probably wouldnt skif was still supplying free labor at no real cost to him and as long as that was going on londer would let sleeping dogs lie now the fact was that although skif was under no obligation to serve at the hollybush for his keep the only thing he could coerce out of kalchan and londer was a place to sleep the food they offered him the leavings from customers meals a pig wouldnt touch if he wanted to eat he had to either find alternate ways of getting meals as he had or do even more work than he already was and as long as he wanted to sleep at the hollybush which though wretched was infinitely better and safer than trying to find a place on the street he had to obey kalchans orders whenever he was around the tavern there were a lot of things that could happen to a child on the street living rough and most of them were far worse than being beaten now and again by kalchan who had no taste for little boys or girls course if e thunk e cud get away wit it ed hev no prollem sellin me kalchan would sell his own mothers services if he thought he wouldnt get caught as it was on the rare occasions when skif got dragooned into helping he often had to endure the surreptitious caresses and whispered enticements of some of the customers who had wider ideas of pleasure than kalchan did as long as kalchan didnt actually accept money in advance for the use of skifs body there was nothing that skif could report to temple or guard and as long as kalchan didnt take money in advance the customers could only try to entice a boy they wouldnt dare try to force him in public the likelihood of one of them cornering skif somewhere private was nonexistent there wasnt a wall built he couldnt climb and he knew every dirtyfighting trick there was for getting away from an adult after some time during which skif felt very uncomfortable bazie nodded now at last he showed a faint sign of satisfaction e might cud do he said to deek give im a try deek grinned and elbowed him wouldn mind puttin one i theye uv that bastid londer bazie continued a gleam in his own black eyes yew work out in one moon yer in deek sucked in his breath he had told skif it would be six moons not one before hed be accepted into the gang skif was amazed himself and tried hard not to grin but failed bazie raised an eyebrow don get cocky he cautioned tis as much t put one i the eye uv londer skif ducked his head yessir he said earnestly i unnerstan sir but he couldnt help feeling excited yell be teachin me then ye kin start now at boiler bazie grunted gesturing to the boy at the cauldron ye take lyles stick skif was not at all loath for the second time today the first had been when he was asleep in the washhouse loft he was warm stirring a cauldron full of laundry was nowhere near as much work as toting rubbish for the ragandbone men lyle was happy enough to give over the stick to skif who industriously stirred away at the simmering pot every so often at bazies imperious gesture hed lift out a kerchief or some other piece of fabric on the stick if bazie approved the second boy took it and hung it up to dry if not it went back in the pot meanwhile deek sorted his loot by color into baskets along the wall bazie darning yet another silk stocking noted skifs incredulous stare as he did so and snorted ye think m gonna ruin goods w dye runnin think agin we gets twice fer th wipes cause theys clean an mended boy thas a fair piece fer damn liddle work wi no risk well put that way skif kept stirring lyle began taking down kerchiefs that were dry bazie continued to mend and deek picked through one of the baskets looking for more things that needed fixing the third boy finished peeling the hardboiled eggs and stood up m off bazie he said he was clearly the oldest and bazie looked up from his mending to level a measuring gaze at him ye mind now the man said carefully ye mind whut i said raf ye slip one an move on no workin a crowd on yer lone the boy raf nodded impatiently with one hand on the doorknob as soon as bazie finished speaking he was already out the door bazie shook his head he don lissen the man said with gloom ah he lissens deek assured their mentor es jest inna hurry theys a street fair agoin by weavers an e wants t get tot afore they pockets is empty bazie didnt seem convinced but said nothing to deek lemme see yer hands he said to skif instead but shook his head sadly over the stubby paws that skif presented for his inspection yell not suit th liftin much he decreed least yell nivver be a master ye got thev long finners fer the liftin kin ye climb deek answered for him like a squirrel i seen im the boy chimed in cheerfully an look at is nose an feet e aint gonna get big for a good bit yet maybe not fer years bazie examined him carefully from top to toes i thin yer right he said after a moment aye reckon ye got a matey deek thatll do deek replied with a grin and turned to skif well be learnin ye th roof walkin then wi me in an out winders mostly an ye live t see summer yell be doin the night walks bazie said with a little more cheer wont be wipes yer bringin ome then nossir deek snorted and skif felt his heart pounding with excitement not likely deek said with scorn wipes more like glimmers ye bring ome the glimmers and well be findin new digs me lads bazie promised his eyes gleaming with avid greed aye that tis usll be eatin beef an beer when we like an from cookshop lyle however looked worried though he said nothing skif wondered why it was clear from the wealth of kerchiefs wipes and other things here that bazie was a good teacher skif saw no reason why that expertise shouldnt extend to secondstory work and the theft of jewelry hed never actually seen any jewelry that wasnt fake all foiled glass and tin but he could imagine it he could imagine being able to eat all he liked of the kinds of food he served to lord orthallens guests too and possessing fine clothing that wasnt all patches and tears nuff mooncalfin bazie said sharply recalling them all to the present boy skif be any more i the pot jes this skif said fishing out the last of the garments on the end of the stick bazie examined it and grunted thatll do he decreed and lyle took it to hang it up deek next lot deek brought over the next batch of wash which was of mingled saffrons tawnys and bright yellows and dumped it in the cauldron lyle got up and took the stick from skif without being prompted and began energetically thrusting the floating fabric under the water ye kin hev two eggs boy an then deekll get ye thin sight uv hollybush bazie declared eat em on th way yessir skif said overjoyed mouth watering at the idea of having two whole boiled eggs for himself he picked a pair out of the bowl tucking them in a pocket and followed deek out the door and up the rickety staircase once down on the street he and deek strolled along together like a pair of old friends deek putting in a laconic comment now and again while skif nibbled at his eggs making them last hed had boiled eggs before this they were a regular item at lord orthallens table but not so often that he didnt savor every tiny bite once deek darted over to a vendors wagon and came back with a pair of buns paying for them somewhat to skifs surprise and handing one to his new mate why didn ye nobble em he asked in a whisper deek frowned ye don mess yer nest he admonished thas bazies first rule ye don take nuthin from neighbors tha way they don know what we does an f hueancry goes up they aint gonna hep wi lookin fer us well that made sense it had never occurred to skif that if your neighbors knew you were a thief youd be the first one they looked for if something went missing he ate his bun thoughtfully as deek pointed out landmarks he could use to find his way back tomorrow i got lessons skif pointed out reluctantly and deek laughed no worries the boy replied bazie won be wake till midday ye cum then look ye know this street skif looked closer at the street they had just turned onto and realized that he did he had just never come at it from this direction before aye he told deek hollybush be down there and pointed gwan deek gave him a little push see ye midday the other boy turned on his heel and trotted back through the gloom of dusk along the way theyd come and in a moment skif couldnt make him out anymore with a sigh and a bowed head he trudged toward his uncles tavern and the cold welcome that awaited him but at least tonight he had something to look forward to on the morrow kalchan never asked him where hed been so long as he came back before dark he just welcomed skif back with a cuff to the ear and shoved him into the kitchen by now the kitchen was full of smoke and the cook coughed and wheezed while she worked it wasnt just the fault of the chimney which certainly could have used a cleaning the cook routinely burned the bottom crust of the bread burned what was on the bottom of the pot dripped grease on the hearth which burned and smoked skif didnt have to be told what to do since his duties were exactly the same thing every day poor halfwitted maisie on the other hand had to be told carefully how to go about her business even though it was all chores shed done every day for the last howevermany years that was why if skif wasnt back by dark and the time when the big influx of customers came hed get more than a cuff on the ear if you gave maisie one thing to do then interrupted her with something else she became hysterical and botched everything first the water barrel had to be filled again not because anyone had used much of it in cleaning but because like everything else in the hollybush it was old used and barely functional it had a slow leak and it cost nothing to have skif refill it to have it mended would have meant paying someone so back and forth skif went doing his best not to slosh the icy water on himself particularly not down his boots when the barrel was full the next chore was to take the bundle of twigs on a stick that passed for a broom and sweep the water and whatever else was on the floor out into the courtyard where the water promptly froze in winter or turned into mud in summer since skif was the one who went into and out of the courtyard most often it behooved him to at least sweep it all to one side if he could next was to bring wood in from the woodpile in the courtyard and mend the fire in the common room which was also full of smoke but not as bad as the kitchen then he collected the wooden plates left on tables carried them to the kitchen and thriftily scraped the leavings back into the stew pot over the fire it didnt matter what went in there since it all blended into the anonymous lumpy brown muck well flavored with burned crud from the bottom that was already there a quick wipe with a rag and the plates were clean and ready for the next customer mugs were next hed figured that it was better to take plates in stacked and not try to mix mugs and plates for if he tried hed drop something and get beaten for breaking it these were crude clay mugs with thick bottoms to make the customer think he was getting more beer than he was those didnt even get a wipe with the rag unless theyd been left in a plate and had greasy gravy all over them they were just upended and stacked beside the plates there was no tableware to bother collecting londer wouldnt have anything that could be so readily stolen in this however he was exactly like every other tavern keeper around this area customers ate with their own wooden spoons usually hung on the belts beside their money pouches some ate with their personal belt knives although these useful implements were used less often the food in cheap taverns was generally soup or stew and didnt need to be cut up nor was there often anything in the bowl or on the plate large enough to be speared on the point of a knife those who had no spoon shoveled the food into their mouths with improvised implements of heavy black bread black bread was all that was ever served at the hollybush made of flour that was mostly made of rye buckwheat and wheat chaff like everything else associated with uncle londer it was the cheapest possible bread to make the strong taste covered a multitude of culinary sins and since it was already black it had the advantage of not showing how badly it was burned on the bottom when mugs and plates were collected it was time to add to the stew in the cauldron the cook put skif to work chopping vegetables while she cut the meat scraps the stew kept going day and night over the fire had been depleted by lunch and early dinner and now had to be replenished londers picks at the market were like everything else more of what better inns and kitchens threw out with a knife that had been sharpened so many times that it was now a most peculiar shape and as flexible as a whip skif chopped the tops and tails of turnips carrots whiteroots and beets and flung them into the cauldron along with the leftover crusts of burned bread too hard to serve even their customers the cook added her meat scraps and began stirring directing him to deal with the bread she had removed from the bake oven built into the side of the chimney there were only three rather lumpy loaves but they wouldnt need more than that the bread was used mostly as an implement and secondarily to soak up the liquid part of the stew so that every drop paid for could be eaten skif sawed at the bread better bread would not have held up under the treatment he gave kalchans loaves but this stuff was as heavy and dense as bricks and just about as edible every slice was thriftily measured out to the minimum that the customers would stand by means of two grooves cut in the tabletop and once cut was buttered with a smear of fat and stacked up waiting to be slapped onto a plate no one ever complained that it was stale skif was not certain it would be possible to tell a stale slice from one freshly cut off of these loaves when the bread was done it was time to go get plates again business was picking up skif could not imagine what brought all these customers to the hollybush unless it was that kalchans prices were cheaper than anyone elses it certainly wasnt the food which would have poisoned a maggot or the drink which would have gagged a goat and maisie was no draw either plain as a post with her dirty hair straggling down her back and over her face she skulked among the tables like a scared skinny little starling delivering full plates and empty mugs while kalchan followed in her wake collecting pennybits and filling the mugs from his pitcher only kalchan dispensed drink the one time that skif had dared to do so in kalchans momentary absence his cousin had left stripes on his back with his leather belt no one actually ordered anything there wasnt anything to order by way of choice you sat down at a table and got beer bread and stew or beer alone by waving off maisies proffered plate or sitting at the fireside bench with the steady drinkers when customers were done skif came around and collected their plates and mugs if one wanted more he waited until maisie came around again and took another laden plate from her if not he took himself off this way kalchan never had to worry about a customer complaining he hadnt been served when hed paid or about a customer sneaking off without paying the only exceptions to this rule were the folk occupying the two benches in front of the fireplace they got beer period and signified they wanted refills by holding up their mugs to kalchan when they were done they left their mugs on the floor which were usually claimed by another bench warmer before skif could collect them skif made his rounds in an atmosphere thick with smoke and the fug of unwashed bodies grease stale beer and burned food light came from tallow dips held in clamps on the wall and from the fire in the fireplace it wasnt much and all the smoke dimmed the light still further he couldnt have made out the faces of the customers if hed wanted to they were just an endless parade of darkshrouded lumps who crammed food into their mouths and went their way without ever saying anything to him if he was lucky every so often one would fondle maisies thigh or breast but if kalchan caught him at it he would have to pay an additional pennybit for the privilege there wasnt any entertainment in the hollybush kalchan didnt encourage selfentertainment either like singing or gaming most of the customers didnt know each other or didnt care to so conversation was at a minimum as for fighting it was wisest not even to consider it kalchan discouraged fighting by breaking the heads of those who fought with the ironheaded club he carried at his side and dumped the unconscious combatants outside the drunks here were generally morose and quiet and either stumbled out of the door on their own two feet when their money ran out or passed out and were unceremoniously dumped in the street to free up space for another customer once in the street an unconscious former customer had better hope that friends would take him home or the cold would wake him up because otherwise the thieves would strip him of everything of value and drop him in a gutter difficult as it was to believe customers kept coming in all night long the benches and tables were never empty until just before closing skif and maisie never had a moment to rest hed tried once to reckon up how much money in the tiniest of coins the pennybit kalchan took in of a night there were four pennybits to a penny beer was two a mug bread and stew were three for a plate just by way of comparison a mug of good clean water from something other than a pump in dubious proximity to a privy cost two pennybits but it wouldnt get you drunk and a mug of sweet spring water was three and a bun like the one that deek had bought him this afternoon was a full penny so you could have something wholesome though not much of it for the same price as a full meal in the hollybush evidently bad as it was there were enough people who felt they were getting value for their money to keep coming the two fireside benches sat four each and the four tables accommodated six eaters unless they planned a night to get drunk the tables cleared pretty quickly skif figured that there were probably a couple hundred customers in here over the course of a day that was where skifs grasp of numbers broke down but he reckoned that the hollybush brought in a couple hundred pennies in a night and maybe a third of that during the day uncle londer obviously had a good thing going here his costs were low buying cheap as he did and the hire of his help was even lower maisie was a halfwit uncle londer paid some relative of hers for her services whatever he paid it wasnt much and she never saw any of it all she got was food and a place to sleep skifs labor was free of course and he seldom ate here and the cook well he didnt know what the cook got he never saw her getting paid but she stayed so she must have been getting something it couldnt have been that much even he could cook better than she did maybe the attraction for her was the unlimited supply of beer he never saw her without a mug somewhere nearby and she had the yellowish color of someone who was drinking herself to death although her shuffling footsteps were steady and she never seemed drunk the upshot was this place was mostly profit for londer that much was for sure skif wasnt going to feel at all guilty about vanishing in a moon uncle londer could just find himself another boy or do without what kalchan was getting out of the situation was less clear certainly he had maisies dubious charms to enjoy whenever he cared to he did get real food rather than tavern swill and he had his own special butt of drink that no one else touched but what else was he getting every night after he locked the front door he waddled down to his fathers home with the nights takings and came back emptyhanded except for the box that held his own dinner he slept in the common room on a greasy featherbed piled high with blankets that were stored during the day in the unused staircase was londer splitting the profit with his son if he was what in havens was kalchan spending it on it wasnt clothing it wasnt women not even the shabbiest streetwalker would touch kalchan with a barge pole without a lot more up front than the penny or two kalchan was likely to offer it had occurred to skif lately that maybe cousin kalchan was just as stupid as he looked and uncle londer gave him nothing in return for his labors at the hollybush if so he didnt feel in the least sorry for him by the time that kalchan dumped the last of the bench warmers outside and locked the front door skif was absolutely dead on his feet not tired hed had that nap in the wash house but aching from neck to toes and longing for a chance to sit down kalchan threw the bolt on the front door and waddled out the back when skif heard the door slam shut behind him he dropped down onto a bench to rest for a moment the cook brought in three plates of stew and bread and dropped them on the table skif took one look at the greasy congealing mess and pushed it toward maisie who had come to rest across from him and was already shoveling her food into her mouth as if she was afraid it was going to be taken from her at any moment the cook had brought her own mug and picked up the beer pitcher that kalchan had left on a table shaking it experimentally finding there was still beer in it she took it her mug and her plate to the fireside and settled down facing the remains of the flames her back to her fellow workers maisie finished her plate picked up the platter in both hands and licked it then went on to skifs portion she never said thank you she never said anything she never even acknowledged his presence skif shuddered got to his feet and plodded into the nowdeserted kitchen from his cubby he took a tiny tin pot and a packet of chava leaves that hed filched from lord orthallens kitchen dipping water out of the barrel he added the leaves and brewed himself a bedtime cup of bitter chava the stuff was supposed to be good for you and make you feel relaxed and calm at any rate at this time of year it made a nice warm spot in his belly that let him get off to sleep he drank it quickly to get it down before kalchan came back and then retreated to the cubby the tin pot was shoved into the farthest corner where he kept a few other things that kalchan didnt think worth taking his own wooden spoon a couple of pretty pebbles some bird feathers a spinning top hed found then he wrapped himself up in his castoff blankets pillowed his head on his arms and waited for kalchan to get back feigning sleep the only light in the kitchen came from the fire and it was dying it was the cooks job to bank it for the night but she forgot more than half the time which was why he had to start it again in the morning when kalchan came back grunting and snorting it was hardly more than a few flames over glowing coals kalchan pulled the door shut and dropped the bar over the inside paying no attention to skif which meant that it had been a good night by kalchans standards if it hadnt been he would either have hauled skif out and knocked him around a bit before letting him get back to his bed or hed have bawled for the cook and had her lay into skif kalchans return was the cooks signal to go on up to her loft she shuffled in dropped the curtain over the door shoved ashes over the coals and limped up the stairs there was some sound of fumbling with cloth overhead then silence meanwhile kalchan settled down to his dinner which he had brought back from his fathers kitchen in theory half of that dinner was supposed to be skifs but in all the time hed lived here hed never gotten a morsel of it kalchan shared it with maisie that is he dropped tidbits to her as if she was a dog in return for which skif generally tried to be asleep by that time the moment when kalchans bedding was arranged to his satisfaction beside the fireplace and maisie was arranged to his satisfaction in it and tonight both exhaustion and the unusual circumstance of having had three decent meals in a day conspired to grant him his wish for slumber he woke from the oddest dream that morning a dream he couldnt quite fathom unless it had come from yesterdays encounter with bazie he had been climbing like a spider along the ledge of a building several stories up it was the dead of a moonless night and he was dressed all in black including a black hood that covered everything except for a slit for his eyes and he had the impression that there was a girl behind him although he hadnt seen any girls at bazies it was an interesting dream though wherever it had come from he heard kalchan snorting and moving around in the next room slowly waking up it must be morning then somehow kalchan had the knack of being able to wake up at exactly the same time every morning although it usually took him some time to go from sleep to full wakefulness the one and only time that knack had failed him hed been dead drunk after swilling himself senseless on the free wine given out at some guild midwinter feast three years ago not that kalchan belonged to any guilds but hed somehow managed to get himself invited or sneak in and hed certainly drunk far more than his share hed gotten back to the tavern on his own two feet but had fallen straight onto the bedding that skif and the cook had laid out in anticipation of his return and he hadnt awakened until noon then between anger at losing a whole mornings custom and the temper caused by his hangover hed beaten skif black and blue blacked maisies eyes and kept them all working and away from the temple largesse of midwinter day all taverns closed the afternoon of midwinter day there was no point in remaining open since there was a feast laid on at the temples for anyone who attended the service beforehand it was the one time of the year that skif maisie and the cook got a chance to stuff themselves sick on good toothsome food and kalchan kept them from it and beat them again the next day for good measure that had marked the lowest point of skifs life and if hed been bigger or older hed have run away and damn the consequences they never let him oversleep by that much again not even though it meant a beating for awakening him not even broken bones would keep skif from a temple midwinter feast he was already up and waiting for kalchan to unbar the kitchen door by the time his cousin waddled into the room kalchan looked at him with nothing other than his usual irritated glare and performed that office then turned and went back into the common room leaving skif to start the fire or go wait for the pony cart in the yard as he preferred for a wonder when the cook had remembered to bank the fire shed actually done it right there must not have been as much beer in the pitcher as she had thought there was one coal left not a lot but enough to get some flames going with the help of lint straw and a little tallow for once skif was done with his morning duties early and he dashed out before kalchan noticed that meant he was waiting at the temple door long before any of the other pupils and decided against his usual custom to go into the sanctuary and watch beel and his fellow priests perform the service not that he cared one way or another about religion but the sanctuary was a place to get out of the cold and to sit down for a service like this one where no one was really expected to come join in the worship there was no grand procession up the center of the temple instead a few priests came in from doors on either side of the altar lit candles and incense and began very quiet chanting if you knew the chants and wished to join you could otherwise you could observe and pray according to your own nature he was the only person in the sanctuary other than the priests and he had found a marginally warm place in the shadows of a pillar so they probably didnt even notice him they certainly didnt make any effort to pitch their voices to carry and the distant murmur combined with the fact that he could lean up against the pillar allowed him to drop into a drowse again he drifted back into the dream of this morning it seemed to be a continuation of the same story this time he and the girl were crouched together in a closet listening to something in the next room the murmur of the priests at their devotions blended with the murmurs in the dream then the dream changed abruptly as dreams tended to do and he found himself incongruously staring deeply into a pair of large deep blue eyes that filled his entire field of vision blue eyes whose blue eyes he didnt know anyone with blue eyes abruptly the bell signifying the end of the service rang and he started awake huh he thought with bemusement havent dreamed this much in cant member when mustve been evthin i et he got to his feet when the priests were gone sauntered out of the sanctuary and joined the rest of the pupils now gathering for their lessons but today was going to be different for the first time ever he put real effort into his attempts to master numbers if he was going to have a position with bazies gang he didnt want the authorities looking for him to clap him back into lessons there was always a chance that they would catch him if that happened his uncle would know exactly where to find him no the moment that bazie had a place for him he wanted to be able to pass his test and get released from school then he could disappear and uncle londer could fume all he wanted at the moment he couldnt see how hanging with bazies gang could be anything but an improvement over the hollybush his determination communicated itself to his tutor and the younger boy put more enthusiasm into the lesson than skif had expected by the end of it hed made more progress in that single morning than he had in the four years hed been taking lessons when lessons were over and the bell rang he got ready to shoot out the door with the rest but before he could he felt a heavy hand on his shoulder holding him in his seat beel he must have noticed something was different skifs stomach knotted and his heart sank he was in trouble he must be and for once he didnt know why or for what reason and that made it worse you can all go said beel whose hand indeed it was but beels hand kept skif pinned where he was only when the room had emptied did beel remove his hand from skifs shoulder and the young priest came around in front of him to stand looking down at him soberly skif do you do work at the tavern in the afternoons beel asked a peculiarly strained expression on his face what skif hesitated if he told the truth surely beel would tell his father that skif was a regular at playing truant from the hollybush and he would be in trouble but if he didnt beel was a priest and might be able to tell and he would be in worse trouble but beel didnt wait for him to make up his mind about his answer i want you to do something for me skif he said urgently his eyes full of some emotion skif couldnt recognize i want you to promise me that today you wont go near the tavern from the time lessons let out until the time darkness falls the look skif wore on his face must have been funny since beel smiled thinly i cant tell you why skif but i hope that you can at least trust the priest if you cant trust your cousin my father is not as clever as he thinks he is someone is angry angry at him and angry at kalchan i think unless he can be persuaded to curb his anger that he is going to act this afternoon you have nothing to do with all this and you do not deserve to be caught in the middle and with those astonishing words beel turned and left as he always did as if nothing out of the ordinary had ever transpired between them after a moment skif shook off his astonishment and slowly left the building once out in the sunlight he decided that whatever beel was hinting at didnt really matter because he had no notion of going back to the tavern during the day anyway he was going to meet deek and get his first lessons in the fine art of thievery deek wasnt lurking anywhere on the way to the building where bazies laundry was but skif remembered the way back to bazies including the secret passages perfectly he suspected that this was his first test and when he rapped on the door in an approximation of deeks knock it was deek himself who opened it with a grin i tol ye ed member deek crowed drawing skif inside an i agreed wi ye bazie said agreeably if e hadn e wouldn be much use woulde there was new laundry festooning the ceiling today stockings and socks only lyle was with bazie and deek the third boy was nowhere to be seen jeet yet asked lyle as deek drew him inside at skifs head shake the other boy wordlessly gestured at the table where half of a decent cottage loaf of brown bread waited with some butter and a knife beside it was a pot of tea and mugs buttered bread half eaten sat on a wooden plate next to bazie all in all it was the sort of luncheon that wouldnt disgrace the table of a retiring spinster of small means not that skif cared what it looked like hed been invited to eat and eat he surely would he fell on the food cutting two nice thick slices of bread and buttered them generously pouring himself a mug of tea bazie watched him with an oddly benevolent look on his face eat good but don eat full afore a job he said in a manner that told skif this was a rule and hed better pay close attention to it nivir touch stuff as makes ye gassy an nothin thatll be on yer breath whut if ye has t hide summun smells onions where no onions shud be or wuss he blew a flatulent razz with his lips and the other boys laughed oh laugh if ye like but i heerd boys been caught that way aye an growed men as shoulda knowed better skif laughed too but he also nodded eagerly bazie was no fool no matter that what his gang purloined was small beer compared with jewels and gold it was obviously supplying them with a fair living and at the moment skif wouldnt ask for more nah good gillyflar tea thas the stuff afore a job bazie continued with satisfaction makes ye keen sharp thas what ye need he waited while skif finished his bread and butter and drank a mug of the faintly acidic but not unpleasant tea he knew gillyflower tea from the temple where it occasionally appeared with the morning bread and it did seem to wake him up when he felt a little foggy or sleepy nah tday deek i don want wipes bazie continued i got sumthin i been ast for special mun wants napkins ye ken napkins deek shook his head but skif who had after all been serving in lord orthallens hall as an ersatz page nodded bits uv linen bout so big he measured out a square with his hands thicker nor wipes kinda towels but fine like them highborns use em t meals wipes their hans an face on em sos they aint all grease an looks sweetly ha bazie slapped his knee with his hand good boy deek where ye think ye kin find this stuff deek pondered the question for a moment then suggested a few names that skif didnt recognize we haint touched any on em for a while make a go bazie ordered i needs twa dozen so don get em all in one place eh right ye ready deek asked looking down at skif who jumped to his feet were off not like that e aint lyle protested glory deek e caint pass i them rags bazie concurred with a decided nod gie im summat on ourn ere lyle i the cubberd lyle went to the indicated alcove and rummaged around for a moment ere thesere too small fer any on us the boy threw a set of trews and a knitted tunic at skif who caught them they were nearly identical to deeks the same neat and barelyvisible patches the same dark graybrown color happy to be rid of his rags skif stripped off everything but his smallclothes and donned the new clothing now bazie and lyle nodded their satisfaction together well boil up yer ol thins an mend em a bit ye kin ave em back when ye git back bazie said we don wan yer nuncle t wonder where ye got new close yessir skif said bobbing his head thenkee sir bazie laughed jest get me napkins imp now properly clothed so that his ragged state wouldnt attract attention skif was permitted to follow deek out into the streets they walked along as skif had already learned to as if no matter how fine the neighborhood they belonged there that they were two boys who had been sent on an errand that needed to be discharged expeditiously but not urgently deek however knew every illicit way into the laundries and wash houses of the fine houses on these streets and he led skif over walls up trees and across rooftops together they waited for moments when the laundresses and washerwomen were otherwise occupied and dropped down into the rooms where soiled linens were sorted for washing it was skif who picked out the napkins from among the rest no more than two or three lightly soiled squares of linen at each place he chose nothing that was so badly greasestained that it was unlikely it could be cleaned nor did he pick out items that were new once retrieved deek did something very clever with them he folded them flat and stuffed them inside the legs of his trews and skifs so that there was no way to tell that the bits of fabric were there at all without forcing them to undress when they had the full two dozen with no close calls and only one minor alarm deek called a halt and they strolled back to bazies skif was tired but very pleased with himself hed kept up with deek and hed been the ones to pick out the loot bazie wanted nothing new nothing overfine nothing that would be missed unless and until a housekeeper made a full inventory not likely that not in the places that deek had selected they made their way up over and down again and back to bazies den this time when deek knocked it was bazie himself that opened the door for them and skif watched with covert amazement as he stumped back to his seat like some sort of bizarre fourlegged creature supporting himself on two wooden pegs strapped where his legs had been and two crutches one for each arm aaa bazie said in a note of pain as he lowered himself down to his seat and quickly took off the wooden legs when ye brings back th glimmers youngun ill be getting properfittin stumps fust thing he gestured in disgust at the crude wooden legs thems no better nor a couple slats hows it that a mun kin be sa good wi needle an sa bad wi whittlin he put the crutches aside and looked at them expectantly here ye be bazie said deek taking the lead and pulling napkins out of his trews the way a conjure mage at a fair pulled kerchiefs out of his hand skif did the same until all two dozen were piled in front of their mentor hah good work bazie told them nah youngun ye look an ye tell me whas the big problem we got wi these fer sellin uv em that was something skif had worried about every single napkin theyd taken had been decorated with distinctive embroidered initials or pictures on the corners them whatchacalls in th corners skif said promptly dunno what they be but theys all different theys t show what owns em but ol bazies gotta cure for that eh deek bazie positively beamed at both of them and took out a box from a niche beside his seat he opened it and skif leaned forward to see what was inside sewing implements very fine as fine as any great ladys tiny scissors hooks and things he couldnt even guess at his mouth dropped open and bazie laughed ye watch an ye learn youngun he said merrily an nivir ye scorn till ye seen bazie took out the tiniest pair of scissors that skif had ever seen and a thing like a set of tongs but no bigger than a pen and several other implements skif had no names for then he took up the first of the napkins and set to work on it within moments it was obvious what he was doing he was unpicking the embroidery but he was doing so with such care that when he was finally done only a slightly whiter area and a hole or two showed where it had been and the threads he had unpicked were still all in lengths that could be used nah ill be doin that t all uv them then into th bleach they goes an no sign where they come from bazie rubbed his hands together with glee an thatll mean a full five siller fer the lot from a feller whats got a business in these things an all fer a liddle bit uv easy work for ye an me nah what sez ye t that youngun skif could only shake his head in admiration that im mortal glad i grabbed fer deeks ankle yesterday and bazie roared with laughter som we boy he chuckled som we skif did not go out again nor did deek instead they emptied out the cauldron of its warm soapy greengray water pouring it down a drain hole in the center of the room and refilled it with fresh this was no mean feat as it had to be done one bucketful at a time from the common pump that everyone in the building shared which was predictably in a well house attached to the side of the building to keep it from freezing bazie had special buckets with lids that kept the water from slopping but it still made for a lot of climbing no wonder bazie was ready t bring me in skif thought ruefully as he poured his bucketful into what seemed to have become a wash cauldron without a bottom his arms ached and so did his back this business of becoming a thief was more work than it looked how often dye empty thisun he asked bazie who was mending a stocking as dexterously as he had unpicked the design on the napkins oncet week bazie replied we saves all th whites fer then wouldna done it early forbye th napkin orders on haste an yere here t hep skif sighed and hefted the empty bucket to make another journey this was like working at the hollybush he had no doubt that he would be the chief cauldron filler until bazie took on another boy so he had this to look forward to once a week for the foreseeable future on the other hand bazie appeared to feed his boys well and treat them fairly skif had plenty of time to think about the situation to contrast how raf deek and lyle all acted around bazie and how wellfed if a bit shabby they looked so bazie wasnt running a gang that was wearing silks and velvets and had servants to do their work so he and the rest of the boys had to do a hauling now and then they were eating they were warm and bazie was a good master what was a little hard work set against that so he hauled and dumped hauled and dumped while his arms back and legs complained on every inward journey when the cauldron was at last filled bazie let him rest for just long enough to drink another mug of tea when the tea was gone bazie put him to building up the fire beneath the cauldron then adding soap and a pungent liquid that he said would whiten the worst stains when the water was actually boiling at bazies direction he added the napkins then other articles that should have been white there wasnt a lot pure white was a very difficult state to attain so the boys didnt steal anything that should be white dunno how them heralds does it bazie said half in wonder and half in frustration them whites sall they wears an how they nivir gets stains i dunno magic deek opined cheekily and bazie laughed gimme stick deek told skif take a breather deek took over then stirring while skif lay back on a pile of strawstuffed sacks that served as cushions letting his aches settle lyle arrived tapping his code on the door and deek let him in raf was right behind him both boys began emptying their pockets and the fronts of their tunics as soon as they came in skif sat up to watch as bazie supervised what came out of their clothing wasnt kerchiefs and other bits of silk this time but metal spoons knives packets of pins and needles fancy pottery disks with holes in the middle ah bazie said with satisfaction wool market good then aye the boy named raf said crowd this was the one that skif hadnt seen much of yesterday and if someone had asked him to point raf out in a crowd he still wouldnt be able to raf was extraordinarily ordinary there was nothing distinctive in his height middling his weight average his face neither round nor square his eyes and hair brown or his features bland and perfectly ordinary even when he smiled at skif it was just an ordinary polite smile and did nothing it seemed neither warm nor false and it certainly didnt light up his features bazie watched him as he examined the other boy and mentally dismissed him and bazie grinned so youngun wot ye thinko raf he asked don think much one way or tother skif said truthfully bazie laughed and so did raf na ye don seet does ye bazie said wall he wouldn see it now woulde raf put in ifn e did thatd be bad the others seemed to think this was a great joke but it was one that skif didnt get the point of they all laughed heartily leaving him sitting on the stuffed sacks looking from one to the other perplexed and growing irritated whas the joke he asked loudly use yer noggin lyle said rubbing his knuckles in a quick gesture over skifs scalp rafs on the liftin lay dummy so i dunno skif retorted his irritation growing whazzat got ter do wi wot i think uv im it aint wot yer think uv im tis is looks deek said with arch significance which made the other two boys go off in gales of laughter again and bazie to chuckle well e aint gonna ketch no gurls wi em skif replied sullenly e don look like nothin special and deek prompted then shook his head at skifs failure to comprehend wots special bout not special finally finally it dawned on him and his mouth dropped open in surprise hoy he said caint give no beak no ways t find im a beak skif knew was one of the city watchmen who patrolled for thieves and robbers took care of drunks and simple assault and other minor crimes anything major went to the guard and anything truly big went to one of the four city heralds not that skif had ever seen one of these exalted personages hed never seen a guard either except at a distance the guards didnt bother with the neighborhoods like this one not unless murder and mayhem had occurred bazie nodded genially thas right aint no better boy fer learnin th liftin lay he said with pride evenf sommut sees him ow they gonna tell beak wot e looks like ifn e don look like nothin now it was skifs turn to shake his head this time in admiration what incredible luck to have been born so completely nondescript raf could pick pockets for the rest of his life on looks like his he wouldnt even have to be particularly good at it so long as he took care that there was nothing that was ever particularly distinctive about him how could a watchman ever pick him out of a crowd when the description his victim gave would match a hundred a thousand other boys in the crowd es got nother liddle trick too bazie continued ere lyle nobble im not at all loath lyle puffed himself up and seized rafs arm ere you he boomed or tried to his voice was evidently breaking and the words came out in a kind of cracked squeak he tried again ere you you bin liftin now raf became distinctive somehow the eyes grew larger innocent and tearful the lower lip quivered and the entire face took on a kind of guileless stupidity mingled with frightened innocence it was amazing if skif had caught raf with his hand in skifs pocket hed have believed it was all an accident whossir messir raf quavered nossir im be gettin packeto pins fer me mum sir and he held out a paper stuck full of pins for lyles inspection tears filling his eyes in a most pathetic fashion bazie and deek howled with laughter as lyle dropped rafs arm and growled gerron wi ye as soon as the arm was dropped raf pretended to scuttle away with his head down and shoulders hunched only to straighten up a few moments later and assume his bland guise again he shrugged as skif stared at him play actin he said dismissively damn good play actin bazie retorted dunno ow long ye kin work it but whilst ye kin serve ye better nor runnin from beaks he set his mending aside and rubbed his hands together sall right me boys oo wants tfetch dinner me raf said don wanta stir washin an don wanta sort goods the other two seemed amenable to that arrangement so raf got a couple of coins from bazie and took himself off the napkins in the cauldron were finally white enough to suit bazie so skif got the job of pulling the white things out and rinsing them in a bucket of fresh water while lyle hung them up and deek sorted through the things that lyle and raf had brought back presently he looked up six spoons two knifes packet uv needles three uv pins empty needlecase four spinnin bobs he said reckon thas nuf wi wot we alriddy got bazie nodded arter supper ye go out t clave ye kin take napkins t dooly at same time an half th wipes lyle yell take t rest uv th goods t jarmin kin do lyle replied genially taking the last of the napkins from skif youngun git that pile an dunk in wash eh he pointed to a pile of dingy shirts and smallclothes in the corner with his chin thas ourn he added by way of explanation ye kin let fire die a bit sos its cool nuf fer the silks when ourns done skif had wondered the stuff didnt seem to be of the same quality as the goods that the boys brought back to bazie obediently he picked up the pile of laundry and plunged it into the wash cauldron and began stirring ye moght be a wonderin why we does all this washin an wimmin stuff bazie said conversationally i tell ye fust i tell mboys allus t nobble outa the dirty stuff cause thas inna pile an nobody aint counted it yet see skif nodded he did see it was like playing a page at lord orthallens meals food was checked before it became a dish for a meal it was checked for pilferage before it was taken to the table and it was checked when it came back to the kitchen as leftovers but there was that moment of opportunity while it was in transition from kitchen to table when no one was checking the contents so dirty clothing and linen probably wasnt counted why should it be but if you stole something off a wash line or out of a pile of clean clothing intended for a particular person it would be missed so we gets stuff tha way but ifs dirty it aint wuth so much f it were just th odd wipe we git from liftin lay wouldn be wuth cleanin an thas why most on liftin lay don clean whut they nobble cause they gotta get glim fer it now sos they kin eat bazie peered at skif to see if he was following us we pass straight onta couple lads as has stalls in market cause what we gots clean an got no markins ont looks jest like wha yed sell t market stall an yer ol mum croaked an yere droppin er goods we spread it round t several lads sos it don look bad that made perfect sense the usedclothing merchants buying the things had to know they were stolen of course either that or they were idiots but there was no other way to tell and once bazies loot was mixed up with all the other things in a merchants stall it all looked perfectly ordinary servants often got worn outgrown or outmoded clothing from their masters as part of their wages or as a bonus and most of that ended up with a usedclothing merchant then those who wished to appear welltodo or seamstresses looking for usable fabric for better garments would find bargains among the bins pickpockets unlike bazies gang who lifted used kerchiefs and the like and outright muggers who assaulted and stripped their victims bare would have to sell their soiled goods to a rag man rather than directly to a stall holder me old mam made me learn th sewin bazie continued m a pretty dab and at un mended stuffs wuth moren toreup an unpickin the pretties makes em plain well like napkins all it costss time an hellfires i got time smart skif said meaning it bazie looked pleased some lads thinks as is sissy stuff an couldn stick i wi us deek put in scornfully some lads sayin no names but as rhymes with scareup thinks is a waste uv time some ladsll end up under the beak inside a moon lyle said lazily cause some lads kin ony think uv glim an glimmers an dont go at thins slow i don care longs i gets m dinner bazie laughed as skif nodded agreement vigorously thas m clever lads bazie said approvingly roof over thead full belly an warm flop thas th ticket glim an glimmers kin wait on learnin t be better nor good righto deek affirmed takes a morto learnin theys old thieves an theys bold thieves but they aint no old bold thieves that seemed excellent advice to skif who stirred the cauldron with a will it wasnt until he began pulling garments out with the stick that skif noticed his own clothing was in with the rest and that bazie had neatly mended and patched it while he was gone hed resewn skifs clumsy work to much better effect and skif felt oddly touched by this considerate gesture raf returned as he started on the next lot of purloined scarves carrying a packet and another loaf of bread theys morto doins over t hollybush he said as he handed bazie the packet skifs head snapped around what doins he asked sharply dunno fer certainsure raf replied summun sez a couple toughs come in an wrecked t place summun sez notwas a fight an evun sez summuns croaked or near it all i knowss theys beaks an a guard there now figgered ye shud know bazie mulled that over as skif stood there stunned the wash stick still in his hands reckon five fer supper he said judiciously huh i cud go wiim arter dark lyle offered we cud reck th doins bazie shook his head nay no goin near raf ye good fer goin out agin hev a drink i th arms the grandly named kings arms was the nearest rival to the hollybush and its owner had no love for kalchan or uncle londer one reason for the rivalry was economic the arms didnt serve the kind of swill that the hollybush did and charged accordingly many many of the poorest customers opted for quantity over quality and their custom went to kalchan if anything bad had happened to the hollybush or its owner the buzz would be all over the arms oh aye raf laughed they don know me there an leastwise ye kin drink th beer thout bein choked arms beers nought so bad bazie said complacently here he flipped a fivepenny coin at raf get a drink and fill me can an come on back raf caught the coin right out of the air picked up a covered quart beer pail and saluted bazie with two fingers im be back afore the bacons fried he promised skif could only wonder what had happened and how beel had known that it would and what if beel hadnt given him that timely warning he could have walked straight into a fight or a trap or who knew what trouble a shiver ran down his back for his own near miss and not for anything that might have happened to kalchan in fact he sincerely hoped that kalchan was at the very least cooling his heels in the gaol given all the rotten things that kalchan had done just the things that skif knew about he had a lot coming to him he shook his head and went back to his stirring bazie had been watching him closely and seemed satisfied with what he saw ye mot not hev a home he ventured skif shrugged hell bargains a bargain ye said a moon ill not spect a flop afore that f nobuddys there i kin sneak in t sleep i kin sleep on roof or stairs or summat he managed a weak grin or even lord orthallens wash house bazie now looked very satisfied evidently skif had struck exactly the right note with him no pleading no asking for special consideration hed got that already just matteroffact acceptance sidestis only for a moon that aint long even in winter actually the wash house wasnt a bad idea skif had slept there once or twice before when kalchan had decided that in addition to a set of stripes with the belt he didnt deserve a bed and locked him out in the courtyard overnight from dark until dawn the only people there would be the laundry maids who slept there and none of them would venture up to the storage loft after dark the ones that werent young and silly and afraid of spirits were old and too tired to do more than drop onto the pallets and snore it would be cold but no worse than the hollybush the only difficulty would be getting in and out since beaks and private guards were on the prowl after dark in force well hed deal with the problems as they came up and not before hard on me if i cant slip past a couple beaks he didnt have very long to wait for his news by the time the next batch of laundry was in the cauldron raf returned with bazies pail of beer and a mouth full of news well he said as soon as deek let him in ol londer did hisself no good this time what i heerd e cheated a mun sommun wi some brass an th mun got a judgment on im sos the judgment sez the mun gets hollybush ony nobuddy tol yon kalchan or kalchan figgered e werent gonna gie up or londer tol kalchan t keep mun out so mun comes wi bullyboys t take over an kalchan e sez i don think so an lays inta em wi iron poker hoo skif said eyes wide with glee wisht ida been there oh nay ye don cuz it went badwrong raf corrected with relish th cook she comes arunnin when she hears th ruckus lays in w stick an th girl she tries t run fer it an slippet an starts t scream an that brings beaks so beaks get inta it an they don love kalchan no more nor anybuddy else an they commences t breakin heads well when tis all cleared up theys a mun dead wi broke neck an kalchan laid out like cold fish tcook ravin an tgirl raf gloated tgirl she turn out tbe bare fifteen no schoolin an pretty clear kalchans been atop er moren once fifteen skifs eyes bulged ida swore she was eighteen sure sixteen anyroad then again hed simply assumed she was there wasnt much of her and she wasnt exactly talkative she had breasts and she was of middling height but some girls developed early wasnt there a saying that those who were a bit behind in the brains department were generally ahead on the physical side thas whut londer e tried tsay but they got th girls tally from temple an shes no moren bare fifteen an that jest turned raf practically danced in place so ol londer he got it fer not schoolin th girl an puttin er where

wouldnt know where he was nor would kalchan who was in any event in no position to talk the trouble was beel knew he had stayed away so would beel send anyone looking for him and should he tell bazie about all of this reluctantly he decided that he had better thiss gettin complisticatered he said unhappily and explained about beel and beels warning the others all sat silent for a moment their eyes on him this beel e knows nowt bout us bazie asked his head to one side quizzically skif shook his head e aint niver sed much tme afore this he replied i allus figgered e wuz jest londers eyes niver reckoned on im warnin me he considered the odd conversation a little further mustve known an didn warn his da neither niver reckoned on im stickin t th law an ye kin bet londer wouldnt huh turned on is own da bazie nodded slowly niver know wut bein in templell do wi a mun he said sagely gets tthinkin bout is own soul mebbe starts thinkin is ol man cud stan bein took down a peg mebbe figgers th ol man cud stand t get held countable figgers a kid don need t get mixed up int point is aint nobuddy knows bout us said raf he stared intently at skif for a very long and uncomfortable moment finally the older boy seemed to make up his mind bazie i sez we votes now youngun aint behind wi helpin an deek sez es good over roof bring un in bazie looked at the other two as skif blinked with bewilderment what on earth was he getting at aye deek exclaimed in by me makes three said lyle lazily es already done moren a couple days than you know did in a week now skif realized what they were saying and his heart leaped as he looked to bazie the leader the teacher oh id already reckoned bazie said with a smile e mights well jump in lyle ye take im wi ye t jarmin sos jarmin gets t know is face an e gets t know th proper pay fer th goods he clapped skif on the back yer in young un theys room nuf an a bed nobuddy got an plenty t go round yere wellcome hey les eat deek exclaimed before skif could really get it fixed in his mind how his life had just been turned around that he had just been fully accepted into the gang that he never had to go back to kalchan and the misery of the hollybush again and no more lessons bazie laughed and distributed the labor skif was set to cutting the loaf and buttering the slices deek to frying slices of fat bacon over the fire beneath the cauldron lyle to get the plates and pot of mustard raf to pour small beer for all of them skif was a bit surprised by that last kalchan never shared beer with anyone but raf divided the quart equally among the five of them with bazies approval it was the first friendly meal that skif had ever shared with anyone the first time he had ever within memory eaten in a leisurely manner while they ate bazie decided what goods they would take to each buyer as soon as darkness fell it would be better to take their bundles of goods out under the cover of night just to be certain that no one in their building saw them toting around unusually bulky packages once they were out in the street of course they would just be three boys carrying out errands but their neighbors in the building shouldnt be given the excuse to be nosy as soon as dinner was polished off and the last of the laundry hung up to dry skif and lyle packed up the goods for jarmin the old clothes seller evidently jarmin was a man who catered to those with a taste for finer things almost all of the fancier goods were going to him when everything had been selected they each had a fairly bulky bundle wrapped in oilcloth bazie showed skif how to use a piece of rope to make a crude backpack of it to keep his hands free take a stick he cautioned skif lyle had already selected a stout cudgel from six or so leaning over in a corner near the door plenty uv folk out therell beat ye jest hopin ye got summat they want like i dont know that skif thought but he didnt make any comments he just selected a stick for himself the packs made negotiating the stairs a little awkward but they got out all right and lyle strode down the street with the air of someone who had a place to get to in a hurry skif had to trot to keep up with him for all that lyle acted lazy back in the room he could certainly put out some energy when he chose to he didnt waste any breath on talking either what he did was to keep his eyes moving up and down the street peering at doorways watching for trouble skif followed his example until now he hadnt been out on the street much at night and he was very conscious of how vulnerable two boys were there wasnt much light nobody wasted much money on streetlamps around these neighborhoods what little there was came from windows and a few open doors and from the torches people carried with them they didnt have a torch but skif didnt really want one certainly having a torch or a lantern made it easier to see your way but it also made it very clear how many people were in your group and whether or not you had anything that looked worth stealing plus you couldnt see past the circle of light cast by the torch which made it easier for you to be ambushed the street was anything but deserted despite the darkness people came and went from cookshops and taverns groups of young toughs strolled about looking for whatever they could get into streetwalkers sauntered wherever there was a bit of illumination with their keepers if they had one lurking just out of sight of potential customers there were ordinary working men and women too coming home late from their jobs for a bit it would only be a little more dangerous to be out on the street than it was during the day skif had figured that this jarmin would be somewhere nearby but apparently he was wrong they must have gone a good ten blocks before lyle made a turn into a deadend street that was very nicely lit up indeed if the dim and sullen hollybush had been at one extreme of the sorts of taverns frequented by the poor this was at the other the whole back of the culdesac was taken up by a tavern blazing with tallowdip lights that had torches in holders right outside the door and light spilling from parchmentcovered windows there was music raucous laughter the sounds of loud talk a group of men were betting on a contest between two tomcats out in the street and with them were three or four blowsy females of negotiable virtue hanging on their arms and cheering on the two oblivious cats on either side of the tavern were shops still open skif never got a chance to see what the one on the left sold because they turned immediately into the one on the right this was their goal an oldclothes shop that specialized in fancy goods of all sorts but mostly for women skif had a shrewd idea where most of the females from the tavern spent their hardearned coins jarmin a perfectly ordinary clerkly sort of fellow had an assistant to help him and when he saw lyle entering the front door he left the customer he was attending to the assistant and ushered them both into the rear of the shop have you got sleeves jarmin asked as soon as he dropped the curtain separating front from back behind them i particularly need sleeves and veils but particularly sleeves and i dont suppose youve got silk stockings lyle shrugged out of his pack and skif did the same aye jarmin all uv that thiss skif es wi us now im be showin im th way uv things yes yes jarmin dismissed skif entirely his attention focused on the packs you know if you just have some good sleeves and stockings i can sell a dozen pairs tonight for some reason all or nowt jarmin ye know that ye takes all or nowt lyle had gone from lazy boy to shrewd salesman in the time it had taken to reach this place and skif marveled at him as he bargained sharply with the fretful shopkeeper at length they arrived at a price that was mutually satisfactory and skif tried to look as indifferent as lyle did it was hard though hed never seen so much money before in all his life aye but thats from how much work a week mebbe an theres five uv us tfeed lyle divided the cash between them just icase he said darkly and showed skif how to wrap it so that it didnt clink and tuck it inside his tunic where it wouldnt show only then did they ease out of the shop where already jarmin had frowsty girls crowding around the counter demanding shrilly to see the new goods if lyle had set a brisk pace going out he did better than that coming back only when they were safely in the building and heading up the stair did he finally slow down with skif panting behind sorry he said apologetically hate goin out got caught oncet fore i worked fer bazie no worries skif assured him i don like it much neither in fact he didnt feel entirely comfortable until he was safely back in bazies room where they pulled out their packets of coin and turned the lot over to a grinning bazie good work he told them both fagged out bout ready t drop skif admitted now that they were back in the warmth and safety the very long day with all of its hard work and unexpected changes in his life suddenly caught up with him not me lyle declared and made a growling face ready t match ye at draughts ol man bazie chuckled show th youngun is cupbard then an ill get us set lyle pulled on skifs sleeve and took him to the side of the room opposite the laundry cauldron where he opened what skif had taken to be shutters over a window shutters they were but they opened up to a cubby long enough to lie down in complete with a strawstuffed pallet blankets and a strawstuffed cushion by skifs standards it was a bed of unparalleled luxury and he climbed up into it without a moment of hesitation lyle closed the shutters for him once he was settled blocking out most of the light from the room beyond within moments he was as cozy and warm as he had ever been in his life and nothing was going to keep him awake in fact the sounds of laughter and dice rattling from the other room couldnt even penetrate into his most pleasant of dreams if skif thought he was going to get off easy by no longer attending lessons at the temple he got a rude awakening the next day he was used to getting up early and he woke or so he guessed at or near his usual time for a moment he was confused by the total darkness scent of clean laundry and the lack of stench and most of all by the fact that he was warm and comfortable he had never awakened warm and comfortable before even in the middle of summer he was generally stiff from sleeping on the dirt floor and except in the very hottest days and nights had usually had all the heat leeched from his body by the floor initially he thought he was still dreaming and moaned a little at the thought that now he was going to have to awaken to kalchan cold and misery then he sat up hit his forehead on the inside of the sleep cubby before he got more than halfway up and remembered where he was he lay back down he hadnt hit his head that hard since he hadnt tried to get up very fast im at bazies ol kalchans in trouble deep n sos mnuncle an i dont never have tf go back t th tavern he lay quietly on his back stroking the woolen blanket with one hand tracing the lines of each patch it must have been patched and darned by bazie the seams were so neat and even no one else was stirring though and for the first time he could remember he lay back in his bed and just luxuriated in the freedom to lie abed as long as he cared to or as long as the others would let him but it looked as if the rest were in no hurry to get about their business what was this new life going to be like the other three boys seemed content and wellnourished and he couldnt see how a legless man like bazie could force them to stay if they didnt want to there would be hard work and a lot of it he knew that much from yesterday when hed hauled water all afternoon danger too despite the fact that the other boys had a cavalier attitude about being caught there was a lot of danger involved in the life of even a petty thief and the penalties were harsh plenty of people meted out their own punishments on those they nobbled before the beaks were called which generally meant a bad beating first then being clapped in gaol then any of a variety of punishments official punishments were many and varied none of them very appealing whichs the point i spose a thief could be transported to work in someones fields could be sent to work as a general dogsbody for the guard could be left in gaol could get lashes it all depended on the judge that was for the first time you got caught after that the punishments were harsher but he wouldnt think about that until after hed been caught for the first time if he was if he was clever fast smart he might never be why not i bin keepin from gettin caught till now an im just a youngun yed think id just get smarter as i get bigger there would be a lot of learning time though a great many menial chores as well and he couldnt expect to share in the profits even his own hauls brought in for a while that didnt matter life here would be a paradise compared with what his life had been like at the tavern in fact he didnt much care if all he did was wash the stuff the others brought in for the next year it wouldnt be any harder than working at the tavern and hed be full and warm all the time with a bed like hed never had before and clothing that wasnt more hole than fabric he lay in the darkness contemplating his future until he heard someone stirring heard the shutters of another bed open and the pad of feet on the floor he turned on his side and saw a flicker of light through the cracks in the shutters of his cubby he pushed them open cautiously and looked out heyla nother lark eh raf said genially come gimme and then skif hopped out and shut the cubby doors behind him raf was bent over the fire under the wash cauldron coaxing a flame from the banked coals take yon tallow dip take a light from here an light them lamps he ordered jerking his head at a tallow dip on the otherwise clean table behind him barely visible in the dim and flickering light from the handsized fire skif picked it up lit it at rafs little fire and went around the walls to relight the lamps he vaguely recalled hanging there there were a lot of oil lamps four and all of them were cobblers lamps with globes of waterfilled glass around the flame to magnify the light the most expensive kind of oil lamp there was skif was impressed he hadnt paid any attention before other than to note absently that although this room didnt have any windows there was plenty of illumination it was interesting bazie didnt spend money on luxuries but in places where it counted the good soap for the laundry for instance and the lighting and decent fuel for the fireplace under the wash boiler bazie got the best when he was done he blew out the tallow dip and put it with the others in a broken cup above the firebox by this time the shutters of another cubby one just above skifs had been pushed open by a foot and deeks tousled head poked out eh bazie he called yawning yon geop men rafr op youngun skif too aye came a muffled reply and the shutter to a third eased open this one was larger taller rather and bazie was sitting up inside peering out at them the stumps of his legs hidden under his blanket satisfied that the fire was well started raf got up and deek swung himself out and down onto the floor the two of them went to bazies cubby and linked hands bazie put an arm around each of their shoulders and swung himself onto the chair made by their hands they carried him to a door beside the one that led outside one that skif hadnt noticed before bazie let go of rafs shoulder which freed one of his hands and opened it and they carried him inside there was evidently another room there that skif had no notion existed the door swung open enough to see inside the room was a privy skif gaped then averted his eyes to give bazie a little privacy but it wasnt just any privy it was a real water closet the kind only the rich had and there was a basin in there as well the boys shut the door and left their leader in there with the door closed until a little later when a knock on the door told he was finished they carried him back to his usual spot beside the fire directly under one of the lamps and mornin tye youngun bazie said genially mornin bazie skif replied wondering with all his might just how anyone had gotten a water closet built down here and where bazie had gotten the money to do so and why skif yere low mun now tis yer task t fetch water fer privy an all said bazie which answered at least the question of where the water for flushing came from an twill be yer task t keep it full which he added pointedly it needs now yessir skif said obediently and went for the buckets well at least one thing hadnt changed here he was fetching water first thing in the morning it took about three trips to fill the tank above the privy and the pitcher at the basin and another trip to fill the water butt that served for everything except the wash boiler by that time all three boys were up and tidying the room at bazies direction after a breakfast of hardboiled eggs and tea he ordered them all to strip down and wash off using the soapy laundry water and old pieces of towel which were dropped back into the wash cauldron when they were done then much to skifs utter amazement instead of putting their old clothing on they all got new clean clothing smallclothes and all from the same cupboard as his outfit from yesterday had come out of their old clothing went straight into the piles waiting to be washed whats on yer mind youngun bazie asked as he tried to keep his eyes from bulging dwe get new duds evry day he asked hardly able to believe it dpends on how hard ye bin workin bazie replied but aye an itll be ev third day at least yere dirty ye stan out ye canna stan out an mind wut i tol ye bout smell skif minded very well and he couldnt believe how thorough bazie was it was brilliant really thas why yon fancy privy raf said with a chuckle heh twas coz ye didn fancy carryin me t tother up an down stair bazie countered and they both laughed but aye coulda had earth closet or jest dropped privy down tsewer thout it bein water closet but thered be stink ye ken an thatd be on us an on tgoods we washed eh so we got mun t put in water closet when we tookt this place raf sighed took a morto th glim it did he said wistfully didn know yed saved tha much ye ol skinflint kept fer when we neededt bazie replied yer wuz liddler nor th youngun had ames an jodri an willem then an we madet up quick enow wut happened t them skif asked cautiously fearing to uncover some old bad news but bazie laughed amess off tookt up wi some travelin show runs t cupnball lay liftin i th crowd jodri es on is own tookt t sum place tsouth an willem made th big un got hisself th big haul an smart nuff t say thassit bought hisself big ouse uv flats like thisun ony in better part uv town lives i part an rents out trest set fer life bazie chuckled and skif sighed with relief if bazie wasnt lying and there was no reason to think that he was then his pupils had done well for themselves and so should he it also spoke well that bazie was perfectly pleased about their success and didnt begrudge them their independence nah youngun ye did good yestiddy buttis in mmind that mebbe ye shouldn be seed fer a bit bazie made a question out of it and skif was in total agreement with him if th guards got inta it what wi th girl maisie an all mebbe they lookin fer me skif replied ol kalchan well e got hisself in bad deep an guardll be lookin fer witness t whut e done an ol londer ell be lookin fer me tshet me up no doubt mebbe permanent bazie lost that expression of pleasant affability that skif had become accustomed to i know sumthin uv ol londer an mebbe e wouldn dirty is ands personal but e knows plenty as would take a int bout gettin ye quiet skif shuddered he had no doubt about that f im not bout ell let ol kalchan ang specially f kalchan don ever wake up an ell say e didn know nothin bout th girl an no one t say otherwise londer had three sons after all he could afford to lose one hellfires ell prolly get a girl and breed him a couple more just t be on th safe side skif thought with disgust he rather doubted that his uncles longdead spouse had enjoyed a love match with the man for londer never mentioned or even thought of her so far as he could tell and londer wouldnt have any trouble finding another bride either all he had to do was go down to the neighborhood where the hollybush had been or one like it and he could buy himself a wife with a single gold piece there were dozens of husbands who would sell him their own wives or their daughters brothers who would sell sisters dozens of women who would sell him their own selves well that was hardly anything skif could do something about i think yere gonna be mlaundry maid fer a fortnt or so youngun bazie said skif was disappointed by that of course but there really wasnt any way around it he had to agree himself he didnt want to get picked up by the guard and he surely didnt want his uncle looking to keep him quiet there wasnt going to be any excitement in washing up scarves and veils but he figured he might as well put a good face on it nawt sbad he replied as cheerfully as he could don mind doin laundry specially bein as its pretty cold out there raf lyle and deek looked pretty pleased over the situation though well they should be since it got them out of hauling water washing and taking out whatever trash couldnt be burned cheer up raf said clapping him on the back bazies nawt sbad compny eh bazie an tis warm enuf in ere real cozylike better nor that there ollybush eh oh aye an e aint eerd all me tales yet bazie laughed so i got an audience wut won fall asleep on me one by one the other boys went out to prowl the streets and see what they could filch leaving skif alone with bazie little did skif guess what lay ahead of him when he finished all the chores bazie set him including to his utter shock washing the stone floor and the last of what bazie referred to as their piece goods were hung up on the lines crisscrossing the ceiling to dry lunchtime had come and gone by then and the boys had flitted in and out leaving swag behind to be cleaned and mended when bazie said right skif fetch me th book there i th shelf next t loaf obediently skif went to the set of shelves that held their daily provisions bazie never kept much around because of the rats and mice that couldnt be kept out of a room like this one and found the book bazie wanted it wasnt difficult since it was the only book there a battered copy of a housewifes compendium of medicines recipes and advice lacking a back cover he brought it over and started to hand it to the old man nay nay bazie said sit ye down ere where lights best an read it out loud puzzled but obedient skif opened it to the first page and began to read it was hardly the most fascinating stuff in the world but bazie followed his every word frowning with concentration as he sounded out a few terms that were unfamiliar to him and correcting him on the one or two occasions when he didnt say the words quite right thatll do bazie said with satisfaction when he finished the chapter ye read good nuff na get ye bit uv charcoal from fire an copy out that fust receipt on table on table skif asked flabbergasted thatll make right mess an ye kin wash t off after bazie countered in a tone that brooked no argument so skif fished out a burned bit of stick and did as he was told with bazie leaning as far forward as he could to see just how neat skifs writing was thatll do he said again when skif finished wash that but don drop th charcoal yere gonna do sums sums skif squeaked turning around to stare at the old man sums wut goodre sums gonna do a thief theyre gonna make sure ye aint cheated by fence thas wut bazie replied as sternly no far more sternly than ever beel was ye thin im gonna let ye tak th swag t fence if ye caint even tell ifs cheated ye ow ye think me other boys did so well eh ow ye think raf an lyle an deek knows wuts wut aw bazie skif wailed an none uv yer aw bazie i aint havin no boys here wut caint do th bizness get th coal in yer and an sit ye down the look in bazies eye warned skif that if he argued he might find himself out on the street promises or no promises with a groan he bent over the scrubbed table and prepared to reveal the depth of his ignorance and it was abysmal it wasnt long before bazie called a halt to the proceedings with skif wondering the whole time if bazie wasnt going to reconsider now that he knew what a dunce his new boy was skif skif skif bazie sighed looking pained oh lad tell me ow tis summun as smart as ye are got t be so iggnerent i didn wan miss me breakfust skif said humbly head hanging in shame t queen sez ever youngun whuts still takin lessons gets breakfust niver did like sums sos easy nuff not t learn em silence from bazie for a moment then much to skifs relief a chuckle well tis onest nuff answer an nay so stupid a one bazie replied well youngun yere bout t learn them sums an learn em thard way the hard way skif soon learned was to get them by rote bazie drilled him and drilled him and then when he grew hoarse and skif thought he might be done for the day at least bazie paused only long enough for a mug of hot tea to lubricate his throat and began the drill all over again only when skif was mentally exhausted did bazie give over and at that point skif was only too pleased to haul water instead of reckoning his fourtimes table shortly after that lyle returned with the makings of dinner and helped skif put together a satisfying meal of bacon dayold bread and apples as the bacon fried and the bread toasted the other two appeared with a new lot of loot raf brought in more sleeves this lot was a bit worn and threadbare about the hems but bazie examined them and gave it as his opinion that he could make a sort of trim out of some of them that would serve to cover the worn parts making them look new deek brought back only a couple of scarves and kerchiefs but a great deal of news for skif yer nuncle londers angin is boy kalchan out t twist on is own which i guess we all figgered he announced as skif and lyle tucked thick slabs of bacon between two pieces of toasted bread and added mustard before handing them around it don look like ol kalchans gonna be much like hisself though healers say is skull wuz fair cracked an they figger is brains is addled they reckon ell be good fer nowt but stone pickin fer is life an i reckon theyll put im out wi sum farmer or tother skif snorted e wuz no prize anyroad he countered but if es addled reckon e caint conterdick nuncle londer but it was an odd thought kalchan who never turned his hand to any physical labor if he could help it eking out the rest of his life in the hard and tedious work of picking stones out of farm fields to make them easier to plow such work was endless or so hed heard it seemed that no matter how many stones one dug out of a given field there were always more working themselves to the surface serves im right it might not be a punishment that accurately fit the crime but it suited skif his only regret was that once again uncle londer was going to escape the consequences but it don bother me nuff that i wanta go talk t guard about it the new owner of the hollybush had already moved his own people in the cook was gone no one knew where but possibly still in guard custody the hollybush was back in business but with slightly better food and drink and slightly higher prices or so deeks sources had told him the new people were a hardfaced woman who acted as cook and her henpecked husband who managed the drink and their three grown children rumor had it that the two daughters who acted as serving wenches could be had for a modest price plying their trade in the curtainedoff alcove that had served maisie as a sleeping cubby given that there were probably no wages being paid to the children plus the added income brought in by the daughters the place would probably remain profitable despite higher prices that would drive some customers elsewhere what was important to skif was that there was no point in going back after his meager belongings by now anyone who was grasping enough to serve as madam to her own daughters would have claimed everything usable for herself well they were welcome to it f i nivir ear uv mnuncle agin twill be too soon skif proclaimed loudly an whoivirs got the ollybush kin ave it much good mayt do em eard awt uv maisie though yer cuz beel wuts wi th temple took er they sez deek told him cleaned er up ad ealers wi er they sez shes twork i temple i kitchen mebbe scrubbin an cleanin she nivir did me arm skif observed slowly nawt thet she ad moren a scatterin uv wits t begin wi ol beel e dun me a good turn reckon es dun wut e cud fer maisie like i sed bazie put in when comment seemed called for niver know wut a monll do when e gets in temple i reckon ol londer ain gonna be too pleased wi yon beel from ere on skif smiled slowly reckon yer right bazie the next several days passed much as the first had skif had originally been more than a little cautious around bazie especially when he found himself alone with the man crippled or not skif was in bazies control and there was always the possibility that bazies interests in his boys went beyond the obvious but bazie never once showed anything but an honest friendliness that was both nurturing and practical if skif had ever known a real father he would have recognized the odd feelings he was having now as being those of a son for a caring father and he would have seen that bazies actions were like those of a caring father for his sons he only knew that he liked bazie enormously and he trusted the man more and more with every moment for his part bazie pretty much took care of his own needs requiring only to be carried to and from the water closet skif was impressed by how calmly selfsufficient he was he had guessed by now that bazie was at least forty or fifty years old and yet he never seemed old there was one thing however that bazie always insisted on which seemed rather odd to skif one of his daily chores was to set a handful of wheat to soaking and rinse the sprouting grains from previous days when the sprouts got to a certain length bazie would eat them he didnt seem to like them very much but he doggedly munched them down f ye don like tha muck whyd ye eat it ev day skif finally asked cuz i like m teeth bazie said shortly f i don eat tha muck seein as i niver sees th sun twont be long fore i lose mteeth an gets sick thas wut healer tol me fust time m teeth started bleedin an i got sick mucky grasss cheapest stuff round sos thas wut i eat in winter summer course theys good stuff i market as the days passed skif finally grew bold enough to voice some of his curiosity about this most curious of situations besides getting bazie to talk made a welcome break from being drilled in sums as he scrubbed or stirred the laundry kettle at first his questions were about commonplaces but eventually he got up the courage to start asking more personal things and finally he asked the most important of all bazie wut appened t yer legs he ventured and waited apprehensively for a hurt or angry reply but bazie voiced neither instead he gazed at skif for a moment tis a long story but tothers ave eard it an likely theyll figger it oughta be me as tells ye he paused ye ever ear uv th tedrel wars skif shook his head thought not bazie sighed gustily wuz back yon twenny yearn easy mebbe thutty well i wuz int tedrel mercs thas mercenaries theys people wut fights wars fer money fer them as don figger on doin the fightin thesselves they wuz paid tcome up from south t fight gainst valdemar fer karse ony twasnt t be

twas good luck thet i lived or bad got took up wi rest uv prisoners an when war wuz over didn hev nowhere t go ony i wuz in meres cuz i wuz caught thievin an had t ide so men a couple other young fools decided we stick tgether an see f i cud teach em wut i knew bout thievin so we did an i did wut appened to em skif asked bazie shrugged went back ome when they had th glim an by then i ad young ames n jodri an i reckoned i ad a good thing i teach the young uns an they share th swag works out he smiled a little tightly sorta like gettin some uv th loot i wuz promised heh mebbe i aint got part uv valdemar but valdemars still feedin me an im still alive so i reckon im doin all right skif pondered all of that it was kind of interesting so how come ye take sech good care uv us eh he asked bazie laughed aloud an yed do what if i didn run off right sides i kinda like the compny ad a good famly an i miss it me da wuz a good un ony e got urt an died an i ad t do wut i culd fer me an mum an m brothers till they got sick an died i plague allus wished id ad family uv me own ony theys nuthin but hoors wi mere army and wut wimmin ud hev a famly wi me now he shrugged so i reckon i make me own famly eh they sez i temple skif ventured thet friends is th famly ye kin choose i sures hellfires wouldn hev chose m nuncle nor kalchan reckon this ways a bit better he was rewarded by a beaming smile from bazie and perhaps just a hint of moisture in his eyes hastily and covertly removed with a swipe of the hand aye bazie agreed reckon thas right skif quickly turned his questions to other topics mostly about life as a mercenary which bazie readily answered tis a life fer the youngn stupid mostly im thinkin he admitted leastwise wuz wi tedrels seems t me if yer gonna fight mebbe ye shouldn be fightin fer things summun else thinks is portant but twas lively did a morta travelin though twas mostly on shanks mare got fed reglar seems t me that lot uv lads joined thinkin they wuz gonna get

different bazie acknowledged theys got onor when they aint elpin beaks theys watchin border cleanin out bandits an slavers he shook his head got no use fer bandits an slavers us we ony take frum people kin afford a bit tookt frum em thas rule right skif nodded hed already been given that rule numerous times here in the poorer part of town the only legitimate targets by bazies rules were the people like kalchan and uncle londer most thefts were out of the pockets and possessions of those who had the money to spare for luxury bandits an slavers theys hurtin people nor better orf than usn bazie declared so bein in guards onorble an valdemar guard takes care uv their own sos not so daft t join op this was getting altogether too confusing and complicated for skif and evidently bazie saw from his expression that he was sorely puzzled don worry bout it fer now he cautioned tis all complisticated an real ard t splain ellfires sometimes i caint figger it out skif pursed his lips but decided that bazie was probably right there was just far too much in life that was altogether too complicated to try and work out like religion if the gods cared so much about people why did they allow the kalchans and the londers and worse to go on doing what they did why wasnt everybody fed and warm and happy why were there rich people who had piles more things than they needed and people like him who didnt have anything it was all far more than he could wrap his mind around and eventually he just had to give up on it all maybe someday hed have some answers for right now he had food in his belly a warm place to sleep and friends and what more could anyone ask for really gods and honor and all the rest of that stuff could go hang he would put his loyalty with those who earned it skif was excited finally two weeks after he had officially joined the gang something he had been hoping for all along happened bazie decided that when the boys returned from their own forays into the streets although his talent probably lay in the area of burglary he ought to have training in the liftin lay the art of the pickpocket all three of the boys were enthusiastic when bazie put it to them e mights well as not raf exclaimed aint no arm an e might ave th touch arter all deek nodded sides bazie any mun kin run shakensnatch an fer that we orter ave a newun anyroad so raf and deek got out some bits and pieces from various cupboards and began to put together a most peculiar object when they were done there was something like a headless man standing in the middle of their room one hung all over with bells there bazie said looking at their handiwork with pleasure mind yons not wut a mun wants t ave in is place when beaks come callin dead giveaway that but i do sez i done good work wi that lad yell no find a better un this side uv th border so bazie had built this thing in the first place it was very sturdy in spite of being assembled from a lot of apparently disparate bits in the mannequins pockets were handkerchiefs around his neck was a kerchief and he had two belt pouches slung from his belt and a third tucked into the breast of his tunic skif could not imagine how anyone could get at any of these tempting articles even the belt pouches were slung right under the mannequins stuffed arm but raf their expert was about to show him watch close young un bazie chuckled yon rafs slick he strolled up to stand beside the mannequin looking from side to side as if he was observing the traffic in a street meanwhile without ever so much as glancing at his quarry his hand moved very very slowly toward one of the handkerchiefs just barely hanging out of a pocket thread by thread almost he delicately removed it and when it fell free of the mannequins pocket he whisked it into his own so quickly it seemed to vanish as slowly as it had seemed to move the whole business had not taken very long certainly it was reasonable to think that a target would have remained standing beside the thief for that period of time especially in a crowd or at the side of a busy street with a lot of traffic on it thas th ard way bazie told skif who watched with wide eyes raf es th best i ivir showed es got th touch fer certainsure now raf sidled up to the other side of the mannequin still casual and calm he pretended to point at something and while the targets attention was presumably distracted for a moment out came a knife no bigger than a finger and between one breath and the next the strings of both belt pouches had been slit and knife and pouches were in rafs pocket and all without jingling a single bell now it was lyles turn and he extracted the remaining handkerchief without difficulty although he was not as smooth as raf im not near that good deek said so im got t do th shakensnatch tha takes two he got up and he and lyle advanced on the mannequin together then lyle pretended to stumble and fell against it setting all the bells jingling as it fell into him deek grabbed for it ey there lad he exclaimed steady on an you watch where yer goin you mussin up a gennelmun like that skif would have expected deek to pretend to brush the mannequin off and get hold of his goods that way but deek did nothing of the sort he simply set it straight they both moved off but now the mannequin no longer had the kerchief around its neck and deek held up both the kerchief and the pouch that had been tucked inside its tunic triumphantly thas th easy road but riskier bazie noted chance is if mun figgers es been lifted ell send beaks lookin fer th shaker thas lyle an im be clean lyle pointed out aint nothin on me an beakll let me go but if e knows th liftin lay itll be deek ell set beak on an deek aint clean or mun might even be sharp nuff t figger twas both on em bazie cautioned ye run th shakensnatch ye pick yer cony careful gotta be one as is wuth it got nuf glim t take th risk but one as aint too smart ye ken an dot whens a mort uv crowd but not sos ye caint get slipput away skif nodded solemnly na tis yer turn jest wipes fer now skif then spent a humbling evening trying to extract handkerchiefs from the mannequins pocket without setting off the bells try as he might with sweat matting his hair from the strain he could not manage to set off less than two and here hed thought that hed been working hard hauling water and doing laundry or going over walls and roofs with deek that had been a joke compared with this at length bazie took pity on him thatll be nuff lad he said as skif sagged with mingled weariness and defeat ye done not bad fer th fust time yell get better ye ken put yon dummy it corner an leave im fer now time fer a bit uv supper skif was glad to do so it was beginning to occur to him that the life of a thief was not as easy as most people believed and most thieves pretended the amount of skill it took was amazing the amount of work to acquire that skill more than he had imagined not that he was going to give up ill get this ift kills me so whas news mlads bazie asked deftly slicing paperthin wafers of sweet onion this was going to be a good supper tonight and they were all looking forward to it deek and skif had done well for the little gang lyle sliced bread and spread it with butter that skif had gotten right out of a fancy inns kitchen that very morning he and deek had been down in the part of town where the best inns and taverns were actually just passing through when one of those strokes of luck occurred that could never have been planned for the inn next to the one they had been passing had caught fire they never found out why only saw the flames go roaring up and heard the hue and cry everyone in the untouched place theyd stopped beside staff and customers alike had gone rushing out either to help or to gawk and he and deek had slipped inside in the confusion somehow without having a plan theyd gotten in snatched the right things and gotten out within moments for one thing they had gone straight to the kitchen as the best bet taking money was out of the question they didnt know where the till was there was no time to search for valuable property left behind in the confusion without discussion they had gone for what they needed where they knew they would find something worth taking the kitchen like the rest of the inn it was deserted when the chief cook left everyone else had taken the excuse to run out too there must have been a big delivery not long before since the kitchen was full of unwrapped and partially unwrapped parcels of food it was like being turned loose in the best market in town skif had grabbed a wrapped block of butter a cone of sugar and a ham and a handful of the brown paper the stuff had come wrapped in deek had gone for a whole big drycured hard sausage a string of smaller ones and half a wheel of cheese then out the back and over the wall they went into an alley that was full of smoke and hid them beautifully as soon as they were in the smoke skif and deek pulled out the string bags they always brought with them just in case something in the nature of foodstuffs presented itself quickly wrapping up the articles in paper under cover of the smoke they stuffed their booty into the bags then came running out of the smoke into the crowd coughing and wheezing far more than was necessary acting like innocents whod gone shopping for their mums and been caught in the alley no one paid them any mind they were all too busy ogling the fire and the bucket brigade or craning their necks to see if the fire brigade had gotten to the burning inn yet skif and deek had strolled homeward openly carrying enough food to last them all for weeks all of it luxury stuff too not the sort of thing they got to taste more than once in a while they had eggs a lot since they were pretty cheap with just about anyone who had a bit of space keeping pigeons or chickens even in the city bread was at every meal bread was the staple of even the poorest diets roots like tatties and neeps were cheap enough too and cabbage and onions even old kalchan had those at the inn dried pease and beans made a good soup and kalchan had those too though more often than not they were moldy skif had eaten better with bazie than he ever had in his life even allowing for what hed snitched from lord orthallens kitchen good butter though butter that was all cream and not mixed halfandhalf with lard they didnt see much of that deeks cheese wasnt the cheap stuff that they generally got made after the cream had been skimmed from the milk and as for ham and sausages sausages where you didnt have to think twice about what might have gone into them well those were food for the rich and sugar skif had never tasted sugar until he started snitching at lord orthallens table bazie had a little screw of paper with some and once in a while they all got a bit in their tea now theyd be able to sweeten their tea at every meal each of them had a slice of bread wellbuttered with a thin slice of onion atop and a slice of hard sausage atop that the aroma of sage and savory from the sausage made skifs mouth water bazie had put some of his sprouting beans on his slice and had taken a second slice of buttered bread to hold it all together skif hoped the sprouts wouldnt taste bad with all that good stuff in and around it they were going to eat like kings for a while kalchan croaked that was from lyle with his mouth full they sez nobuddy sez nothin bout londer i ast round bout skif don seem nobuddys lookin fer im now reckon they figger e saw tsetto an run off huh skif shrugged tol ye about th fire thas all we saw deek nodded agreement but his mouth was full so he added nothing white shirts sniffin round little puddin lane said raf dunno why askin a mortuv questions they sez huh wonder what herald wants down there there wasnt anything down in that part of town that a herald should have been interested in little pudding lane was just a short step above the neighborhood of the hollybush so far as poverty went stay clear uv them for now bazie advised they got waysuv tellin whos lyin no fear there raf promised aint gonna mess wi no witchy white shirt be stupid to skif reflected not that hed ever actually seen a herald except once passing at a distance even then he wasnt sure it had been a herald it could just have been a palecolored horse bazie shrugged dunno they be witchy jest sharpish ah likes not tis summat got nawt tdo wi likes uv us when anyun seed a white shirt down here eh not sos i kin member raf the oldest said at last skif and deek both shook their heads saw un oncet passin through lyle offered and grinned passin fast too reckon had burr under is saddle white shirts don bother wi us bazie said with certainty and finished the last bite of his supper with great satisfaction slavers raiders aye big ganguv bandits aye een summat highwayman een footpad f es stupid nuff to murder alonguv robbin but us a bituv cheese here a wipe there nothin fer them tis th beaks we gotta watch for but all th same he finished brow wrinkling steer clearuv em they nivir done me no arm een wi me an the rest fightin em but they nivir done me no favors either an karsites allus said they was uncanny he laughed well demons is wut they said but figger the source when skif went to bed that night though he wondered what would have brought a white shirt a herald down as close to their territory as little pudding lane it had to be something important for as bazie said the heralds didnt bother themselves about petty thieves as long as it was only a crime against property and not against a person bazie had strict rules about that too not the least because if by some horrible accident someone was hurt it could be a hanging offense it made no sense to court that kind of trouble all for the sake of some loot you could get another time better to drop everything and run if it all went bad even if you were one of a team there was no point in coming to the rescue when that would only mean that two of you would be caught instead of one the worst that would happen to any of them would be some time in gaol and perhaps a beating administered by the victim only raf had a previous offense against him and he would take care to give another name if he was caught bazie had coached skif on this with great care the very best ploy was to get rid of anything you had on you so youd be clean if you couldnt do that the next best was to act scared and cry and carry on and say that you were starving had no job and couldnt get one then produce a convincing cough as if you were very sick none of them were so wellfed that they looked prosperous though none of them ever went hungry either and they could probably carry the story off as long as the beaks didnt get involved lyle with his innocent face and ability to make his eyes seem twice their size had gotten away with that more than once wish i could skif thought with envy but lyle was another on the liftin lay and it was easier to get away with that when you were caught out on the street than it was when you were caught in someones house raf was sitting up with bazie although deek and lyle had already gone to bed their voices came easily through the shutters of his bed lissen bazie midwinter fairs acomin an im thinkin we should be workin it in twos raf said quietly one liftin an one tcarry mebbe im bein nervy but i don like tidea uv yon white shirt sniffin round you reckon bazie sounded interested hadn tried that afore hevwe aints risky reckon i takes the youngun lyle take deek an evry time we gets a lift we takes it t carrier carrier brings it here then no matter how wrong t all goes aint noun caught wi moren one lift onim raf sounded very sure of himself and truth to tell skif agreed with him it would be a lot more work that way for the carrier who would have to run back and forth between wherever the fair they were working was being held and here but raf was right no matter what happened no matter what went wrong no one would be caught with more loot than a single kerchief or pouch somthin got ye spooked bazie asked shrewdly skif could imagine rafs shrug cant magine white shirts lookin fer lifters mebbe somethin i th air not like white shirts t be i this t th chancy partsuv town somethins up an raf paused lotsuv forners pretendin not tbe forners lurkin about itaverns askin questions little too casuallike na ye stay clearuv them boy there was real alarm in bazies voice thas stuff fer th highborns aint no call tget mixed up wi them eh raf agreed but he still sounded worried bazie ye gotta wonder how long afore their bizness gets down amongst us ye know whut they sez rotten apple falls fastest and futhest ony thin you an me an the likesuv us got t ave tdo wi them is t get out uv way when they falls and that seemed to be the end of that skif was asleep before raf helped bazie into bed when the midwinter fairs began the first thing they had to do was try and figure out which ones they would work because every other thief and pickpocket in haven would be doing the same bazie had a shrewd way of eliminating them based on the number of beaks assigned to each the general level of prosperity and the number of drunks by midafternoon he wanted a moderate number of beaks a slightlybetterthanmiddle level of prosperity and a high level of drunks so not too surprisingly he decided that they should work the fair associated with the brewers guild he also picked one very large fair held just outside the city where there were going to be a large number of tent taverns because it was playing host to a series of contests among performers not bards in fact bards were excluded these were to be contests among ordinary musicians with no gifts he chose a third fair for no reason that skif could tell but raf and deek grinned over it so broadly that he figured hed get the joke when he saw it the last chosen was the first fair of the seven days of midwinter festival lyle went out with deek early in the afternoon with skif and raf following about a candlemark later it was an overcast day the still air with a soft feeling about it and humid the clouds hung low so low they looked about to touch the roofs of the buildings to either side of the narrow street skif kept looking up as they walked down the streets heading for the square where the fair had been set up weather like this meant snow the kind that packed together easily he wasnt disappointed it came drifting down shortly after they got on their way big fat fluffy flakes of it is snow good or bad fer bizness skif asked anxiously midwinter had never been more than a date to him before this hed avoided the fairs since he hadnt any money to spend and kids as ragged as hed been back in the bad kalchan days were generally chased away by stall holders and beaks why bother to linger about the edges of a place you wouldnt be allowed into so he hadnt any idea what to expect or whether weather would make any difference in the number of people crowding the aisles between the stalls raf cast a glance upwards and smiled this kinda snows good he opined gets people playful belike gets em thinkin bout fun an not bout keepin an eye out na snow wit a nasty wind thas diffrent or colder thas diffrent too thiss nearperfek perfek ud be sun right arter this kinda snow he scratched his head speculatively this weather olds reckon therell be drink stalls an ot food stalls down triver too an aside summa th ponds i fancy parks peoplell be skatin makin snow stachoos an forts avin snowball fights kids skif asked littles raf laughed na growed people too graybeards even i seed em skif could only shake his head at the notion of fullgrown adults having the leisure to pursue snow sports they heard the fair long before they saw it a jangle of instruments laughter loud voices echoing down the narrow street and when they saw it it was just a patch of color at the end of the street only as they approached it did the patch resolve into people waving banners and a couple of tents bedecked with painted signs on canvas obviously there was far more to it than that to account for all the noise but that was all they could see at the end of the street this was usually the cattle market where larger livestock was bought and sold once every fortnight part of the market the part where really fine horses and stud bulls and prize milch cows were sold was actually underneath a building on ten tall stone pillars it was like a fine house where the ground floor had been reserved for stalls for beasts skif didnt know what went on in the building atop those pillars but it was probably some sort of commerce the rest of the place was just an open square which on market days had rough wooden pens set up for the more plebeian stock sheep goats donkeys mules and those cattle and horses without aristocratic lineage as they came to the end of the street the fair filled that square and even edged onto the walkways around the perimeter and the first thing that met skifs astonished eyes was a woman in a flounced dress so short he could see her legs up to the thigh balancing along a rope strung from the eaves of a shop to the staircase of the stone cattle stalls na youngun raf said in his ear iffn ye kin do that ye kin call yersel a roof walker eh skif shut his open mouth and followed raf into the aisles of the fair within a very short time it became perfectly obvious to him why bazie had picked this fair for them to prowl there were next to no women among the patrons and very little besides food and drink for sale the drink was all alcoholic mulled ales wines and ciders cold beer cold wine and cold spirits of wine which skif had only heard of never seen the food was all hot spicy or salty the rest of the stalls were uniformly for either entertainment or games of chance and there were more entertainers in this place than skif had ever seen in his lifetime jugglers acrobats musicians that was only the start of it there were trick riders most of them women and attired very like the girl on the rope overhead a man who did the most astonishing things with a loop of rope a fireeater a sword swallower and girl dancers whose costumes were even more abbreviated than the riders which was probably why most of the patrons here were men and boys the dancers of which there were two different troupes and a set of raree shows promising to display the most amazing oddities held pride of place in the stone cattle stalls theyd used their tents to fashion canvaswalled rooms beneath the roof firmly anchored to the stone sides of the stalls making it impossible to lift the corner for a free look to the acute disappointment of the boys swarming the place the rest of the entertainers had to make do with their tents raf found a good place for him to stand out of the way just beside the stone staircase where he also had a fine view of the ropedancers he disappeared into the crowd wake up now he told himself sternly yere here t work not gawk it was hard though so many distractions what with the dancers going across the rope when the crowd tossed enough in their dish to make it worth their while with the glimpses of men on stilts at the farther edge of the fair the music coming from the dancers stalls and the enthusiastic bawling of the tent men each proclaiming that nothing had ever been seen like the wonders in his tent well certainly skif had never seen anything like this just as he was starting to get cold raf reappeared with a cunninglymade paper cone full of hot chestnuts which they shared and under cover of which raf passed skif a fat belt pouch after skif had peeled and eaten enough nuts to warm hands and stomach raf took back the halfempty cone and loudly told him to run on home after a brief whining plaint skif trotted off exactly like a younger brother chased off by an elder and once away from the fair he broke into a loping run in no time at all he had left the pouch with bazie to be examined and counted and he was on his way back more than warmed up by his exertions it took longer for raf to return the second time skif hoped that this meant he was being very careful he also hoped that by the time he brought back rafs second or third lift bazie would tell him that theyd collected enough for the day although this fair was exciting and completely fascinating skif couldnt help being nervous about the composition of the crowd mostly male and mostly drinking it wouldnt take much for an ugly situation to develop the ropedancers didnt seem to mind his being there though which was a plus hed been afraid they might chivvy him off while he waited for raf to appear again he watched them closely trying to figure out how they did it there were four of them two girls a young man and a little boy the latter didnt walk the rope himself he seemed to be there mostly to balance on the shoulders of the young man reckon since ye caint see up his skirt fer an extra thrill they figger they gotta have th littleun there t make it more dangerous of the two girls the youngest was the most skilled while the older one just walked the rope stopping midway for some onefooted poses the younger one had an entire repertoire of tricks so far skif had seen her balance on one foot while she drew the other up with her hands to touch her heel against the back of her head dance a little jig in the middlemost part of the rope jump up and come down on the rope again and make three skips with a jump rope out there it was evenup between her and the older one for the dancers called out most often the older one was well older and had breasts and all but the younger one was more daring it soon became obvious to skif that the young man and the little boy were there to draw the crowd they were the ones that went out for free the girls didnt dance unless there was enough money collected in the tin bucket hung at the side of the stone staircase and there was an older man with them who emptied it every time one of them went out skif thought there was a distinct family resemblance there with all of them just then raf came up again this time with a pair of waxed paper cones full of hot mulled cider he handed one to skif be kerful drinkin he cautioned in a lowered voice theys summut in bottom seen lyle skif asked in a normal tone e sed ed be ere didn e oh aye an is mums gonna be right riled raf said cheerfully as skif sipped the hot spicy liquid fragrant with apples es ad a pair uv beers an es aworkin a third lyles gotten two lifts and raf saw him working a third that was good news by this point skif understood why raf had warned him there was something hard and heavy at the bottom of the cone heavy enough that if he didnt finish the cider quickly and carefully the cone might start to disintegrate and leak im gonna go ome an seef mumll be lettin us stay past dark he offered raf gave him a nod i be over torse dancers he said and wandered away as skif trotted off again he continued to sip at the hot cider until he could actually see what was in the bottom it looked like jewelry chain with a seal attached and from the taste now in the cider it was silver he ducked into a blind alley and fished the thing out dumped the last of the cider and then thinking put it back into the paper cone nobody as poor as he was would waste waxed paper by throwing it away it was too useful as a spill for starting fires so he screwed the thing up into a spill shape with the chain and seal inside and went on his way again bazie was pleased with the lift but gave no hint that he was ready for them to stop so back skif went again raf had warned him that he might be noticed by the ropedancers themselves if no one else if he went to the same spot a third time the new meeting point was the tiny corral holding the trick riders raf had pointed out a good place the first time theyd gone past where a farm cart full of hay was pushed up against the corral fence that was where skif went propping hands and chin on the lower railing as he watched one of the riders riding standing on the back of a remarkably placid horse a heavy hand gripped his shoulder skif jumped or tried to with that hand on his shoulder he couldnt do more than start heart racing he turned his head expecting a beak im clean he thought thanking his luck that he was im clean e caint do moren tell me tget out but it wasnt a beak that held his shoulder it was his cousin beel beel he squeaked im pleased you recall one family member skif beel said gravely id like to know where you have been skif thought quickly wuz runnin errand came back an saw tfight he said trying to look absolutely innocent saw beaks int an well ad tspook beel couldn do nothin so i ad tspook beel nodded but then where have you been why didnt you come to skif took a chance and interrupted beel i caint go back t nuncle londer he whispered them beaks they want me ttell em stuff bout maisie but ye know thas stuff nuncle don want me ttell the corners of beels mouth turned down but he took his hand from skifs shoulder it would be wrong of me to put temptation in the path of anyone let alone my own father he said reluctantly he didnt say what temptation but they both knew what it was just tell me no dont tell me where you are and what youre doing but are you continuing with your lessons at least skif groaned and beel smiled reluctantly am i theys wusn you set me a sum i dare ye twelve plus fifteen beel asked instantly knowing that skif couldnt have added that when hed run twenny skif screwed his eyes shut and concentrated twennyseen he looked up at his cousin triumphantly beel lifted his hands conceding defeat but what should i say if my father asks if ive seen you the priest wondered out loud worriedly lying skif clambered up into the hay tell im ye seed me i cattle market then ina farm cart frum tcountry he suggested pertly antwont een be a fib now beel smiled ruefully and shook his head youre too quick and facile for your own good skif he said you worry me but all right if uncle londer thinks youve gone and hired yourself out as farm labor hes not going to bother trying to find you he rested one hand on skifs head in a blessing and moved off into the crowd fortunately no one else seemed to have been paying any attention to this interchange skif clambered down out of the cart reluctantly for the hay had been soft and warm before anyone from the trick riders group could scold him for being up there he was still sweating just a little that had been a narrow escape how could he ever have guessed that beel of all people would show up here this was not the sort of atmosphere hed expect a priest to seek out he looked anxiously for raf hoping the older boy hadnt been caught after much too long a wait he spotted raf working his way through the crowd coming toward him the relief was enough to make him feel lightheaded time t go raf said as soon as the two of them were together wut i got nowll gi bazie nuff an i sore yer cuz ere i did moren see im skif said as they worked their way out to the street together he explained what had happened as they walked together toward home aw hellfires raf responded making a motion of wiping his forehead thas a closeun too close skif agreed i tookt chance on beel bein a goodun ye ken e warned me afore th todo an e is i guess well i saw im doin some beggin fer temple guess thas ut brung im there raf said id made lift an i nipped off tlook fer ye it had been far too close a call and skifs heart was still beating hard but at least theyd made some good lifts today and no harm done skif had managed by luck and a glib tongue to squeak out of danger again it was a good dark night not quite moonless but it had been a day moon shining in the blue sky half the afternoon and it would be down before skif was done with tonights job right now the shadows were perfect for getting into his target skif sniffed the air appreciatively but silently it was crisp and cold with a hint of wood smoke but not as much as there would have been if all of the fireplaces in his target house were running with a dry autumn this year there was no treacherous ice on the roof or tops of the walls in the fall the first bit of cold kept people off the street at night and tucked up in a cozy tavern instead of wandering about taking a chance of getting run off by the watch for the fun of gawking at the show homes of the rich all except for the rich themselves of course who were making the rounds of their estates if they had them or their friends estates it was hunting season and no one who was anyone would be caught dead in haven at this time of year not when they could go out to the country and use the slaughter of wild game as an excuse to have house parties it was very strange granted wild game was a luxury and featured prominently in the menus of the rich but surely their foresters and servants could do a better job of going after it than people who didnt hunt for a living still all to the good a smart lad with the wit to go and hold horses outside the great houses always knew who was having a countryhouse party and who was going to it when the master was away the servants left behind took their own sort of holiday and getting into and out of a place was childs play well it was if the child was skif hidden in a join of two walls where one stuck out a little farther than the other and left a vertical slot of dark shadow skif waited until the watch passed there was always the nightwatch to reckon with in the fine neighborhoods when hed worked by day snatching things out of the laundries of many of the fancy houses he now robbed he hadnt had to worry about the nightwatch not that he worried too much about them now so long as he knew the schedule he kept his head turned away as they passed with their lantern to keep from having his night vision ruined then nicked across the top of jesolons wall to the top of kalinks the home of the arrogant new money grain merchant kalink was his goal tonight the irony was that this kalink wasnt even the one who made the money that had been the work of the old man who according to gossip had been perfectly content to live quietly if comfortably in the country until he died not the son though gossip grudgingly admitted he had as good a head for business as the old man maybe better but he wasnt going to molder in the countryside not he he got himself a showwife long on looks and short on wits and had this brand new manor house built right up against jesolons first tearing down the smaller place that had been there he hadnt been content to simply add on no nothing was good enough for him but brand new nor would he hear any advice on the subject it didnt matter to him that having walls run right up to the side of a house just made a road for a thief to walk on hadnt he the very latest in locks and catches and other theftfoiling hardware hadnt he ornamental ironwork on all the windows hasnt he left enough room between them bars to put a donkey through skif snickered to himself as he slipped over the roof of the stable to the uneven triangle of shadow just against the wall of the house that the moon wouldnt reach at this time of night he managed it all without a hint of sound not the rattle of a stone not the slip of a slate in his allblack sneak suit with hands in black gloves and face wrapped in a black scarf smeared with charcoal where the scarf didnt reach the only part of him visible was his eyes oh yes indeed kalink was new money in haven and proud of it proud enough to have halved the space where his garden had been in order to put in a stable for a single horse the fool true enough a horse was a very expensive very conspicuous luxury in the city but one horse would only pull a cart which there was no room for or a tiny twowheeled halfcarriage called a gig that would only carry two people at a time and which barely fit in the stable with the horse your servants couldnt use it for real shopping it was fair useless for transporting anything large or heavy if you had a country estate or summer home as kalink did you still had to hire a wagon to carry your baggage when you went back for hunting season or summer you had to drive it yourself for there wasnt room for a driver it was good for two things for arriving at a fancy do with the wife and for the wife or a daughter to go off with a servant to drive to make her daytime social calls if wife or daughter couldnt drive the only way your women could use it for their shopping was if they arranged for whatever they bought to be delivered which was of course what kalinks brainless bit of a showwife always did though she did have wit enough to be able to drive herself so she took her personal maid instead of a manservant skifs lip curled in contempt very nice and in exchange for this ostentatious bit of statusflaunting merchandise you lost half your garden and had to have an extra boy around to drive and to tend the creature from dusk to dawn just to keep the beast from stinking up the neighborhood and drawing flies the showwife had a weakness for jewelry and brainless though she might be she had a true experts eye for picking out the best and a boy who volunteered to hold mladys horse while she browsed through the goldsmiths row in search of more of the stuff heard a lot especially when mlady was discussing with her new maid what to do with her purchases and since mlady was in a hurry to go on her social calls as well as brainless and the maid was new and didnt know where the concealed cupboard for the valuables was mlady told her all about it right then and there instead of waiting until she was back home and showing her now came the only tricky part skif wasnt going to take his eyes off the garden below or the garden next door so he had to reach up over his head and feel for the ledge of the gabled window there then pull himself up onto the windowsill by the help of the bars there and the strength of his arms alone quietly smoothly so that no movement of a shadowwithinashadow would draw the attention of someone he hadnt spotted the nightwatch had some good sharp men on it not many but some that was why skif took no chances by turning his back and when hed finished with kalink hed never hit this neighborhood again no matter how juicy it seemed with hands wrapped around the bars on the window he drew himself up into the enclosure like the work of the ropedancers it looked smooth and easy but it was hard work hard enough to make his arms scream as he pulled himself up braced himself pulled himself farther up braced then finally got himself up onto the windowsill he wedged his thin body between two of the bars and waited watching listening for any sign of another shadow down below now slipping out of cover to go and fetch his fellow thief catchers nothing just for good measure he waited until fingers and toes were chilled but not numb and clumsy and only then did he slip the special paperthin flexible knife blade from the sheath strapped to his ankle and slip the catches for there were two which was kalinks idea of being clever of the window beside him he didnt open the window though not yet from out of the breast of his tunic came a tiny bladder full of lamp oil which he used on the bottom edge of the window to ease its passage this was no time to have it stick then he squirted the last of it on the hinges no time to have them groan either only then did he push the two halves of the window open shove his body sideways between the bars and feel with his foot for the floor all of it moving as slowly as a tortoise when he was certain that his footing was secure he put all of his weight on it brought the other leg in through the window and closed it putting on one of the catches to hold it shut there were plenty of jobs that had been ruined because the thief forgot to close the window behind himself on a cold night and some servant felt a draft skif knew where he was the room used by the showwifes maid hed watched over the course of several nights when kalink and his wife were at some party or other knowing that the girl would have to stay up to help her mistress undress the windows of the masters bedroom might have fancy locks on them but the maids cubby wouldnt and it was a guarantee that the maids room would give off right onto the masters bedroom that was one of bazies first lessons when skif began doing real work the layout of the fancy houses the weak point in a house was always the personal maids room or the manservants but the maid was the easiest target the personal maid she had special status because she had to be able to do more than just run errands fine sewing and embroidery hairdressing getting her mistress into and out of her fancy clothes and doing it unobtrusively that was just the start of her duties she might have to cook sweet and soothing dainties if her mistress was indisposed and the cook had gone to bed she certainly had to be able to do a bit of nursing if her mistress was ill pregnant or elderly depending on where her loyalties were she might be the masters spy on his wife or run discreet messages and make assignations with her mistress lovers she had to know how to make and apply beauty treatments even cosmetics and she had to be available day or night except when the mistress was out of the house and hadnt taken her along all that required a room of her own adjoining the masters bedroom or the mistresss if husband and wife didnt share a bed and since the last thing the mistress would tolerate was the ability of her maid to go sneaking off without the mistress knowing about it the maid generally had to go through the masters bedroom to get to the rest of the house that prevented the maid from entertaining men in her own room and greatly curtailed her ability to slip off and be entertained by them elsewhere a good ladys maid was something no woman wanted to lose so it was worth the effort to keep her from the lure of masculine company after all she might get married or pregnant or both then what would her mistress do dismiss her of course and go on the hunt for another this was a quest more fraught with hazard and emotional turmoil than the search for a new cook one could train a new maid of course but then one would have to be willing to put up with a great deal while the girl was in training skif remained crouched on the floor and waited while his eyes adjusted to the deeper darkness in this tiny room he reached out cautiously and encountered the rough wool of a blanket to his right so the bed was there he moved carefully to avoid making the floorboards creak and edged over to the bed making sure not to lean on it he located the head and the foot then eased down to the foot and felt for the wall from the wall he found the door and eased it open creeping through it practically on hands and knees his nose told him that he was in the bedroom and that the room was the exclusive domain of the mistress for the aroma of perfume and scent in here was far heavier than most men would tolerate so the mistress and master slept separately hed rather expected that the showwife whether she knew it or not shared her husbands attentions with a lady of earthier qualities kalink kept her in a nice little set of rooms near the cattle market where she had once been a barmaid the showwife was just that a trophy to be displayed before other men and eventually got with an heir well this was his goal he grinned to himself old kalink thought he was being so clever most hiding places for valuables were in concealed wall cupboards but according to the wife kalink had the brilliant notion to put his in the floor under the bed well kalink thought it was a brilliant idea skif would not only be able to get at it with ease hed be hidden while he went through the goods at his leisure the bed was easy enough to see even in the dim light from the three unshuttered windows for the curtains hadnt been drawn since the mistress wasnt home there was plenty of moonlight in this enormous room which faced south and west poor little maid she had her window on the east side where the sun would smack her right in the eyes if she hadnt gotten up by dawn skif kept his head down though and still moved cautiously traveling crabwise below the level of the windows the bed was one of those fashionable tall affairs that you needed a set of steps to get into so that you could get to the safecupboard under it of course and skif slid beneath it with plenty of room to spare now for the first time he drew an easy breath if he found what he thought he was going to find this one haul of loot would keep him and the two new boys bazie had taken in and do so in fine style for a year or more which we need they aint liftin enough tkeep us in old bread he slipped off one glove and felt along the floorboards for the telltale crack that would show him where the edge of the lid was and whatever sort of mechanism there was to lock it shut he was the last of the old lot deek had undergone an unexpected growth spurt that turned him into a young giant and made his intended occupation of house thief entirely impractical he served as a guard for a traveling gem merchant now who better to watch for thieves than a former pickpocket last skif had heard he was on his way to katashinain raf had gotten caught and was currently serving out his sentence on the border with karse for hed made the mistake of getting caught with his hand on the pouch of a great lord lyle had given up thievery altogether but only because hed fallen in love instead hed gone head over heels with a farmers daughter one fair day in the cattle market and she with him and over the course of six weeks had managed to charm her old father into consenting to marriage lyle had taken to country life as if hed been born to it which amazed all of them lyle himself not the least bazie had gotten two new boys just before lyle fell to the lovegods arrows and it was left to him and skif to train them up that was why skif was going for a big stake now the boys werent up to the lifting lay yet and only one was adequate at swiping things out of laundries skif had the feeling that bazie had taken them more out of pity than anything else lyle had brought them in after finding them scouring the riverbanks mudlarking for anything they could salvage thin malnourished and as ignorant as a couple of savages even bazie wasnt about to try and pound reading writing and reckoning lessons into them that fell on the head of some poor priest at the nearest temple skif traced the last line of the lid of the safecupboard and found the keyhole easily enough no one had made any effort to hide it and he slid his lock pick out of a slit pocket in his belt and went to work by touch before very long he knew for a fact that kalink had been cheated for this was the cheapest lock he had ever come across in a fancy house it wasnt the work of more than a few moments to tickle it open and ease the lid of the safecupboard open with the lid resting safely on the floor skif reached into the cupboard and began lifting out heavy little jewel cases placing them on the floor until he had emptied the cupboard what he wanted was gold and silver gold was soft with a hammer and a stone skif could pound chains and settings into an amorphous lump which any goldsmith would buy without a second thought and at a reasonable price silver wasnt bad to have you could cut it up with a chisel and render the bits unidentifiable hed rather not have gemstones you couldnt just take them to a goldsmith and you wouldnt get more than a fraction of their worth so he opened each box and examined its contents by feel rejecting outofhand all gemstudded rings earrings and brooches he selected chains bracelets pendants anything that was mostly or completely made of metal the emptied boxes went into the bottom of the cupboard with the rest stacked on top with luck the theft wouldnt even be uncovered for days after kalink and his wife returned by then of course everything would have been disposed of melted down it might even become part of whatever baubles the mistress picked to replace what was lost each piece he selected he wrapped in one of bazies purloined silk handkerchiefs to cut down on sound and stored in one of the many pockets of his sneak suit it didnt do a thief a great deal of good to be chiming and chinking when he moved he hesitated once or twice but in the end opted to be conservative in what he chose he had no way of getting rid of that triple rope of pearls for instance nor the brooch that featured a huge carven cabochon and when his fingers told him that the piece he was holding was of finelydetailed enamel he couldnt bear the idea of destroying something that so much work and creativity had gone into the same for the wreath of fragile leaves and flowerlets a clever way of getting around the fact that a commoner couldnt wear a coronet but the rest of what he chose was common enough mere show of gleaming metal without much artistry in it he replaced the last box and eased the lid back down on the cupboard now came the fun part getting out he didnt want the maid to get into trouble that was hardly fair if he left the window in her room with the catches undone shed be the first to be blamed so after he slid out from under the bed he crept across the mistress room to try the next door over it was a bathing room and he laughed silently good old kalink nothing but the best for him for certainsure nothing but the latest there was an indoor privy everything flushed away with water after youd done and a boiler to heat bath water all served from a cistern on the roof good place to leave open he opened the catch on the window and pushed open the shutters that served this room instead of ironwork let kalink presume that this was how his thief got in and wonder how on earth he came up the wall from the yard or down the wall from the steeplypitched roof now he returned to the maids room hed go out the way he came but he had a trick to use on the kind of simple bar catches on that window a loop of string on each of them let him pull them closed again once hed closed the window behind him by now the moon was down and there wasnt a chance anyone could see him in moments he was down in the alley running like a cat heading for his next destination he didnt dare be caught in this outfit there would be no doubt in anyones mind that of what his business was but there was a remedy for that too two streets over was that wonderfully handy cavity in lord orthallens wall and that was where hed left a set of breeches and a tunic in the safety of the utter blackness he pulled the bricks loose and extracted them the hood of his shirt became a high collar the scarf around his face and throat went around his waist beneath the tunic he wiped the charcoal from his face with the inside of the tunic and in very little time a perfectly respectable young lad was strolling down the street with a bundle under his arm he could be anyones page boy or young servant on any of a dozen errands and he even passed patrols of the nightwatch twice without any of them stopping or even looking at him if they had theyd have found nothing worse than a bundle of gentlemans underthings and if he was asked hed mumble and hide his face and say he couldnt rightly say but his mistress had told him to take them quietly to a certain gentleman and there wasnt anything else he could tell them the watch would of course assume that the gentleman in question had been forced to make a hasty exit from a bedroom where hed had no business being and had left the least important of his clothing behind as it was no business of the watch to oversee the morals of anyone skif would be sent on his way perhaps with a laugh the closer he got to his destination the more relaxed he felt already he was planning where to take the metal how to show the two boys to pound the gold and silver into flat indistinguishable sheets hunger caught up with him then he hadnt eaten much following bazies dictum that a full stomach made for a slow thief bazie wasnt actually expecting him for some time yet since it was always his habit to go home by as circuitous a route as possible a thief might be expected to hurry back to his den to hide his loot and so a thief who feared pursuit would do but no one knew that skif carried a small fortune about his person nor did any sign of it show no one knew that the kalink household had been robbed this night there was no pursuit so why hurry back a thief runs when no one chases him was another of bazies dictums and he was right if skif looked guilty acted guilty the watch might detain and search him just on principle so as soon as he reached a street of inns and taverns the same one in fact where he had robbed the kitchen of a burning tavern so very long ago he drifted to the busiest a hostelry called the white rider with a sign of a herald and his companion the place was packed full with not one but two musicians one at each fireplace holding forth it was of course impossible to hear either of them in the middle of the room skif found a place on a bench next to a weary woman and her brood of four children got the attention of a serving girl by grabbing her apron as she went by and ordered food he tried ordering wine he always did and the girl smirked when she came back with his meat pie and drink the drink was cider he sighed and paid her while the wealthy were out of the city the common folk came in a great deal of business happened here in the fall before the snows made it hard to travel skif picked out half a dozen different accents just from where he was sitting there could not have been a more vivid contrast to skifs old home too cold three seasons of the year full of sullen silences always in semidarkness here it was cozy and the air vibrated with talk and sound there were plenty of lights and there was no problem seeing what you were eating the tabletop got regularly wiped down with clean rags and although the floor was collecting a fair bit of debris over the course of the evening skif had no doubt it would start out the next day being swept clean enough to eat off of the cooking aromas were all tempting and there was no reek of stale beer and wine if the customers themselves were a bit whiffy well it had been a hard day for some of them skif relaxed further his belly full of good food and cider the woman gathered up her herd and left to be replaced by a couple of equally weary fellows who could have been any sort of craftsman or farmer or possibly skilled laborers come for one of the hiring fairs they both seemed rather concerned huddling together to murmur at each other and finally the one nearest skif asked him politely what the least expensive meal was skif gave them a friendly grin and his recommendation theys a right couple uv conies he thought wondering which of the lads who worked this inn on the liftin lay would lighten their pockets before they found work not that it was inevitable of course but it was likely you had choices in the liftin lay you could work half a dozen of easy marks like these two or you could go for one big score whod be cannier better guarded in either case there was about the same amount of risk for each time you worked a mark in a crowd you increased the risk of getting caught well that wasnt his outlook he didnt work the liftin lay anymore and the two lads back with bazie were too hamhanded for it right now he finished the last of his cider shoved the pottery mug to the middle of the table and extracted himself from the bench taking his bundle with him from here on his story if he was caught by the watch would change now he was bringing his fathers clothing home from the pawnshop it wasnt at all unusual for a family to have articles of clothing in and out of pawn all the time and in some families in more often than out and as he stepped out into the street sure enough a watchman across the street caught sight of him frowned and pointed his truncheon at him you boy he barked halt there obediently and with an ingratiating cringing smile skif obeyed whatve ye got there the watchman asked crossing the street skif held out his bundle hunching his shoulders and the watchman poked it with his truncheon well speak up s m dads shirt n smalls mlor skif sniveled jest got em fom goden ball mlor with the fall hiring fairs going on all over haven the set of good linen smallclothes that had been in pawn all summer would come out again for someone who was going to a hiring fair would be dressed in his best then theyd go right back in again if the job was only until winter and the end of hunting season open it the watch demanded skif complied no one paid any attention to them as he did so firstly because you didnt interfere with the watch and secondly because you didnt want the watchs attention brought down on you the watchmans eyes narrowed suspiciously if yer dads smalls ve been in the nick whatre ye doin eatin at yon rider he demanded a stab of alarm mixed with chagrin pierced skif but he didnt show it even as he opened his mouth he had his answer after all this was quarterday or near it servants and laborers with yearround jobs got paid four times a year tis outa me own wages mlor he said with a touch of indignation mdad got a busted arm an mma didn say nothin till now when i got me quarterdays now he let his tone turn grumbling reckon a lad kin hev a bit uv dinner when es missed is own sos e kin help out is own fambly on is own halfday there just enough story to let the watchman fill in the rest on his own a son in service a father injured and out of work neither parent saying anything until the boy had the money to retrieve the belongings theyd put in pawn to see them over the lean time common servants got a half a day off which usually began well into the afternoon and was seldom truly a halfday once every fortnight or so servants as young as skif usually didnt leave their employers houses except on the halfday off after theyd gotten paid servants like skif pretended to be wouldnt have gone out during dinner time either which was probably why the watchman had been suspicious for why would a common servant spend his wages on food he could have gotten for free at his masters table or if he was visiting his parents why hadnt they fed him but skifs story had him visiting his parents discovering the situation and going out after the pawned clothing presumably there was nothing in the house to eat his job wouldnt include the benefit of broken meats to take home to his relatives and as a result he was missing a meal to do his duty to his parents skif was rather proud of his fabrication the watchman grunted wrap it up then boy and keep moving was all he said skif ducked his head and tied up the bundle again then scuttled away the back of his neck was damp with sweat that had been a close one he made a mental note not to use that story or that inn again any time soon but with the haul hed just made he shouldnt have to better be careful be just my luck now t get hit with someun pullin a smashngrab that was the crudest version of the liftin lay a couple of boys careening at full speed down the street one after the other one would knock a mark over while the other came in behind and scooped up whatever he dropped if that happened to skif while the watchmans eye was still on him the watchman would be suspicious all over again if skif didnt pursue his attackers or refused to swear out charges against them and at the moment he couldnt afford the suspicions that might lead to being searched so he clutched his bundle tightly and raised his eyes to look up and down the street for the little eddies of activity that would mark a couple of smashers on a run and that was when he saw the red glow above the rooftops fire he picked up his pace a big fire and from the look of it somewhere near home there would be a crowd a mob and a mob meant opportunity even in a neighborhood as poor as his for fire drew spectators from all over he might not be an expert at the liftin lay but he was good enough to add to his take in the kind of crowd drawn by a big fire he moved into a trot get home empty out his pockets then go out in the mob he joined a stream of running shouting spectators and wouldbe helpers all streaming toward the fire like so many moths attracted to the light now he could see the lick of flames above the rooftops he was jostled on all sides and had to concentrate to keep hold of the bundle and keep his own head cool while everyone around him was caught up in the fever of the moment and he couldnt help notice that he was getting nearer and nearer to his own home excitement began to take on a tinge of alarm hellfires its close wonder who he turned the corner with the rest of the mob and stopped dead his building his home now nothing but flames this was no place for a herald but then herald alberich was no ordinary herald he hunched over his drink and rubbed at eyes that watered from the smoke filling the room his ears filled with the droning of drunks his nose wrinkling at the stench of too many unwashed bodies burned food and spilled beer he had been in this part of haven to meet an informant in a disgusting little hole of a tavern called the broken arms an obvious and unsubtle reference to what would happen to a patron who displeased the owner the sign above the door crudely and graphically painted enforced that human arms do not normally bend in four places the informant had never showed his face which didnt really surprise alberich hed never reckoned the odds to be better than even at best the man might have gotten cold feet or he might even be entirely cold at this point cold and dead if so it was fiftyfifty whether alberich would ever find out what had happened to him bodies didnt always turn up even when the river was frozen over there were plenty of ways in which a corpse could vanish without a trace the people alberich suspected of intrigue against the queen were powerful and had a very great deal to lose if they were unmasked they had the ways and means to insure that more than one petty informant vanished without a trace if they cared to make it so the herald sipped his stale beer and watched the rest of the customers from beneath lowered eyelids in the back of his mind he felt his companion fretting at the situation and soothed him wordlessly he knew that no one was going to recognize him no matter what kantor thought alberich did not stand out in this crowd of neerdowells pickpockets and petty thieves he probably wouldnt had he not bothered to disguise himself he never would wear the traditional uniform of heralds whites even when presiding over the classes of heraldic trainees in his capacity as the collegium weaponsmaster preferring instead a leather uniform of a slightly darker gray than the color used by the trainees heralds whites let those with fewer sins on their souls wear the whites hed have worn black if the queen hadnt expressly forbidden it bad enough that you look like a storm cloud shed told him i wont have them calling you herald death you stand out quite enough as it is from the rest of the heraldic circle he didnt point out to her that they might as well call him herald death that his business was death the ways and means of dealing it out he simply bowed and let her have her way she was the queen after all but at the moment he was not on official duty and he wore nothing like a uniform his clothing was as drably nocolored as tattered and patched as that of any man around him his unfashionably short hair was concealed beneath an ancient knitted cap of indeterminate shape and origin only his sword and knives themselves both disguised beneath plain worn leather sheaths would have told a different story about him or perhaps not to a slumdwelling bullyboy his sword was his life and many of them bore weapons of superior make a blade that bent or snapped or wouldnt hold an edge wasnt the sort of tool to risk your life on alberich was supposed to be that sort of sellsword a man whose blade went to the man with the price of it with no questions asked on either side in the absence of his informant alberich was going to have to pretend he was here for the same reason as everyone else to get drunk he would probably have to use this tavern again and he definitely needed to keep in character he didnt dare break this carefully constructed persona it had taken too long to build most of the beer was going to hit the floor though like many of the patrons here he had his own mug a leatherjack tarred on the inside to make it waterproof and kept tied to his waist when not in use only unlike theirs his had a hole in the bottom he seldom took an actual sip when the mug went to his lips he relied on the slow but steady leak and the crack in the table he sat at to conceal where the rest of it got to no one in this place was going to notice beer on the floor under the layer of rushes that hadnt been changed for a year or more only when his mouth dried or he needed something to wash the stench of the place from his tongue did he actually drink the beer stale and flat was still preferable to the taste left behind in breathing the miasma of this miserable tavern impatience made his head throb and he forced himself to look bored instead of pained he was wondering just how many more mugs of the noxious stuff hed have to down before he pretended to stagger out when the street outside erupted into what sounded like a riot shouts screams his heart rose into his throat and his pulse hammered in his ears as every nerve in his body reacted to the alarm he and virtually everyone else in the tavern jumped to their feet and ran for the door he wasnt slow to react but there were still plenty of people who were between him and it he ran right into a wall of jostling bodies he told himself that this was a good diversion to get out and back to the collegium but he couldnt help himself the noise out there was of panic and fear and he had to respond for the rest of course any disturbance held a potential for profit sweat stink mingled with a different kind of smoke this was coming from the street outside the noise now was like nothing hed heard off a battlefield he shoved his way through the crush at the door ruthlessly elbowing one man in the ribs and brutally kicking another in the knee to get them out of the way both men swore and turned on him both shrank out of the way when they saw who it was he had a formidable reputation here another reason why he was reluctant to sacrifice this persona he could virtually come and go as he liked unmolested and it had taken him no few knife fights to build that reputation he had yet to draw his sword in here which was a mercy though his opponents only thought he was showing his contempt for them by meeting their swords with his knives the poor fools had no idea that he was saving them from almost certain death at his hands if he pulled the longer blade it wasnt his skill he was worried about it was theirs hed seen drunken brawls end fatally when one idiot slipped and rammed himself onto anothers sword it had happened while he watched far too often to want to see that happen with him holding the blade and it wasnt because he liked them that he spared their wretched lives it was because if he killed a man even by accident the watch would come and there would be questions and there would go his hard work in establishing rokassan among the bullyboys that was why it was alberich here and not another herald he was practical he delivered another elbow blow to a set of ribs this time with enough force to it to make the man in his way whuff curse and bend over and alberich was out into the notsoopen street it should have been dark and relatively empty it wasnt it was filled walltowall with a churning mass of spectators and a growing number of those who actually were doing something a lurid red glow reflected off their filthy upturned faces as the wretched denizens of this neighborhood organized themselves into lines of hands that passed buckets of water away toward alberichs right the source of the glow was as hellish as any sunpriest sacrificial fire alberich had ever seen in karse an inferno that had once been a building raged madly against the black of the night sky it was one of the nearby tenement blocks and it was a solid sheet of flame from its foundation to its roof it couldnt have been more fully involved and alberich was struck motionless for a moment at the sight for he couldnt imagine how it had gotten that way so quickly short of a redrobe priests demon calling for one horrible moment he wondered wildly if a redrobe had infiltrated the capital of selenays kingdom but then an acrid whiff told him the real reason the building was so thoroughly engulfed tar someone had been painting the sides of the building with tar the heavy black smoke roiling over the tips of the highest flames confirmed it a sudden wind drove it down into the street and screams turned to coughs and gasps now that wasnt uncommon in this part of the city landlords didnt care to spend more than they had to on maintenance of these old buildings and when they got word that an inspection was in the offing they frequently created a new and draftless facade by tarring and papering the exterior with any of a number of cheap substitutes for real wooden siding the work could be done in a day or less and when finished presented a less ramshackle appearance that generally fooled overworked inspectors into thinking that the building was in better shape than it actually was with so many buildings to inspect and so little time the inspector could easily convince himself that this one didnt need to be looked at any closer and move on the work would hold for a while but soon the paper would disintegrate the tar soak into wood left unpainted for so long that it soaked up anything and the place would revert to its former state a little darker perhaps and for a while the tar would fill in the cracks that let in the winter winds but nothing more still it seemed odd to alberich that the thing should be blazing with such fiendish enthusiasm slum landlords were as stingy with their tar and paper as they were with everything else and to burn like this someone must have laid the stuff on with a trowel stop him stop that boy alberich sensed rather than saw the swirl in the crowd that marked someone small and nimble bouncing off the legs of those around him then a wiry hard body careened into his hip he was running to the fire somehow alberich knew that and his foresight showed him what would happen if the boy made it through the crowd a small body writhing in the flames screaming dying an echo of the sacrificial fires of karse his gorge rose automatically he reached out and snared the tunic collar of the boy before he could get any farther the boy turned on him a spinning swirling fury let me go he screamed let me go he spat out a stream of invective that rivaled anything alberich had ever heard and flailed at alberichs arm with hard little fists i gotta get in there ye bastid i gotta screaming and writhing in the flames alberich didnt bother arguing with the brat who was redfaced and hysterical and he didnt have time to calm him no doubt his family was in there gods he pulled the boy off his feet and the brat still fought well if they were they were all dead or they were somewhere out in the street sobbing over the loss of their few possessions nothing could survive that inferno but there was no reasoning that point alberich couldnt let the boy go but there was work here he might not be dressed in whites but he knew his duty which was to help to save the buildings around the doomed one he couldnt do that if he was playing nursemaid with a grimace of pity alberich pulled his dagger as the boy continued to struggle toward the blaze and tapped him behind the ear with the pommel nut the first moment the target presented itself the boy went limp alberich was still near enough to the door of the tavern to struggle back and drop him just inside as far out of harm as possible in this neighborhood then he joined one of the many bucket brigades coalescing out of the mob until the guard and the pumps and hoses arrived they had to help convey water to soak down the buildings to either side of the fire to keep it from spreading already kantor was raising the alarm for him and help could not be more than a few moments away but he felt a moment of pleasure at the way people around him were responding to the emergency so they werent all villains even though that was all hed met since he began frequenting the broken arms even in this neighborhood people could work together with one accord the water throwers wisely concentrated their efforts on the buildings that were merely in danger and let the blazing tenement burn itself out anything and everything that could hold water was being pressed into service with men and strong women sending the heavy laden vessels toward the fire and smaller women and children passing the empties back to be filled again alberichs concentration narrowed to a few vital tasks breathing taking the bucket passing it on with a minimum of spillage turning back for another before he lost track of anything but the pain in back shoulders and arms and the cold that soon penetrated his soaking wet hands legs and feet alberich saw buckets pots pans and even a chamberpot making the circuit up and back up and back while people shouted incoherent directions and the flames laughed at their efforts skif woke stiff and cold with his head aching so much it hurt to open his eyes he would just as soon have rolled over and gone back to sleep but the pounding pain behind one ear and the cold prevented him from doing so as did the sudden and electrifying realization that he wasnt in his bed he sat up abruptly despite a stab of agony that made him yelp the cold gray light of the street coming in at an open door next to where he sat completely disoriented him where was he this isnt home then it all came back in a rush the triumph of the successful run the fire the man whod grabbed him keeping him from from with an inarticulate howl of grief he scrambled to his feet and staggered out into the street he coughed in the miasma of fog and stale smoke that met him like a wall he fought through it staggered a few paces and stared unbelieving at the absolute ruin of his home gone all gone a few blackened timbers stuck up out of the wreckage marking where the staircase had been the rest was an unidentifiable pile of charred wood and stillsmoldering wreckage the vultures were already hauling away whatever they could claw out for in this place even charcoal could serve to help eke out firewood and grant a few more hours of warmth they had baskets barrows their clothing and faces black with soot somewhere under there was his home bazie and the boys another howl tore itself out of his throat and he hurled himself at the burnedout building scrambling over what was left of the wall to the corner where the secret stair should have opened to bazies little den it was underground surely it was safe surely they were safe they have to be safe but he couldnt help thinking how long it took them to get bazie out on the rare occasions when he emerged from the room what a struggle it was to get him to the latrine much less up the stairs and that was on a bright spring day not amid choking smoke and flames he began to dig frantically first with his bare hands then with a piece of board until that broke then with the blade of a shovel he found still hot enough to blister his throat closed his gut clenched he welcomed the pain in his hands he should have been there if hed been there if only he dug with his eyes streaming tears and his heart breaking dug and dug and dug until finally he was too exhausted to dig anymore he collapsed among the wreckage and wept leaning against a broken beam until his sides ached and his eyes burned and still he could not weep himself free of the pain gone all gone i should have been here all gone its my fault all gone all gone around him people continued to scavenge oblivious to his grief or ignoring it his grief turned to anger then and he stood up and tried to scream at them for the plundering ghouls that they were but his throat was raw and his brain wouldnt work and all he could do was moan in the end it was jarmin unlikely jarmin clerkly proprietor of the shop who bought their plundered silks who found him there whimpering like a whipped dog jarmin who stepped mincingly into the wreckage looked him up and down and asked without any expression at all got swag skif shocked out of his grief for a moment by the sheer callousness of the query began to shake his head then suddenly remembering that triumph that seemed to have happened a hundred years ago nodded jarmin took him by the elbow and hauled him to his feet shock sealed his mouth and made him docile though his aching eyes still streamed tears his gut ached and deep inside he wanted to strike out at whatever was nearest to strike out at himself gone all gone they picked their way to the street with jarmin still holding tightly to skifs elbow and once there jarmin headed determinedly toward his own shop skif just went along too heartbroken to think too full of bottomless mourning to care if jarmin was about to lead him off somewhere to kill him for his loot let him i deserve it i wasnt there they entered the shop all of its tawdriness only too apparent by day the girls were nowhere to be seen as jarmin shoved skif before him past the counter through a flap of hanging cloth then up a narrow staircase that ended in a room just under the roof a single dirty window covered with oiled parchment let in enough light to see by there was a pallet there and blankets and some storage boxes nothing else jarmin had to stoop to fit under the rooftree and he shoved skif roughly down onto the pallet and gestured impatiently at his tunic skif read the gesture for the demand that it was and slowly undid his clothing to pull out the jewelry hed taken last night he laid it out on the pallet jarmin squatted down beside him and examined it piece by piece grunting a little but otherwise saying nothing now hes gonna kill me skif could form the thought but couldnt muster anything beyond the grief to care what happened to him care no that wasnt true he cared he deserved death if hed gotten back sooner if he hadnt been so determined to bring back every damned piece that couldnt be traced id have been there id have noticed in time id have gotten them out gone all gone he just sat where he was staring at his own hands while jarmin turned the jewelry over and over in his hands finally the fence pulled the kerchief off his own neck and bundled it all up he shoved the ends under his belt and knotted them got up slowly and painfully then descended the staircase it looked from where skif sat as if he was sinking into the floor tears began again burning his eyes and his raw cheeks and skif didnt even bother to wipe them away his nose closed up his gut spasmed and his thoughts ran around and around in a tight little spiral like a mouse in a trap gone my fault i should have been there a moment later jarmin was back again a bundle of cloth under one arm a jug in his hand here he said gruffly these ought to fit you he dropped the clothing down next to skif who stared at it without comprehension even swap the swag for these food and this room for three moons after that you get another place or start paying as skif stared at him as if he was speaking in a foreign tongue he glanced at the jug in his hand as if he was surprised by its presence oh aye and you get this he shoved it at skif until skif took it from him perforce go on pop the cork and drink it jarmin said fiercely numbly skif obeyed the cork came out with difficulty the liquid inside tasted of cherries and burned like fire burned him from his tongue to his gut all the way down he knew as soon as he tasted it what it was though he had never done more than sip a bit before this the dregs left in some rich mans glass spiritsofwine and worth its weight in silver he gasped at the fire in it but didnt spill a drop it would bring blessed oblivion which now he wanted more than hed ever wanted anything it went to the head quickly in a few swallows he was dizzy a few swallows more and he had trouble holding the jug jarmin his eyes gleaming fiercely in the half light steadied it for him and helped him lift it to his mouth keep drinking boy he heard as from a far distant land twont take the hurt away but itll numb it for a while numb numb was good maybe if he was numb he wouldnt keep seeing bazie and the boys and the flames he swallowed again the stuff burning its way down into his belly now he was more than dizzy the room swam around him and tilted disconcertingly jarmin took the jug corked it and set it aside as he sagged down onto the pallet the room was definitely moving but he didnt care he just didnt want to have to watch it so he closed his eyes best thing for you boy he heard then footsteps on the stair he didnt actually pass out he hadnt drunk quite enough for that but every time the numbness and the dizziness started to wear off he heaved himself up onto his elbow and took another long pull at the jug until it came back again now and again he tired of simply feeling the room circling him and opened his eyes to watch the ceiling rotate when the light started to fade jarmin appeared again with a lantern and bread and sops a chamberpot and a big jug of water he made skif eat and drink all of the water before he took the lantern and the plates away skif took some more pulls on the jug then and as shrill voices and the cajolery of the girls drifted in through the window he let the liquor take him away to a place where nothing mattered anymore jarmin told him later that hed stayed drunk for a week sometimes he cried but only when he was alone sometimes he heard someone moaning and dimly realized that it was himself all he knew was that the jug was temporarily his best friend jarmin kept it full but insisted on his eating and drinking water an annoyance he put up with because it meant that jarmin would top off the jug he retained enough of sense and the cleanliness bazie had drummed into him to make proper use of the chamberpot it never seemed to stink so jarmin must have kept it clean as well jarmin also came up to talk to him now and again for a while he ignored the words and the man because he didnt want to go to the place where words meant something for a while that is until something jarmin said jarred him back into thinking word is jarmin said into skifs rosy fog that fire was set set skif opened his eyes with an effort wha he managed mouth tasting of old leather and liquor jarmin didnt look at him and his tone was casual word is that the landlord got a surprise inspection and was going to have to fix the place or get fined going to cost him dearly either way so he burned it instead and is calling it a terrible accident understanding and anger stirred sluggishly he burned it jarmin shrugged as if it all mattered not a whit to him word is thats the case dont who the landlord is was he corrected you know how it is probably some highnecked merchant or even highborn couldnt possibly be connected with us nor where we live couldnt soil himself by openly owning the place but takes our copper right enough so long as no one knows where he got it but he wouldnt want to have to spend good coin either not when burning it costs him less and allows him to sell the lot afterward anger burned away the fumes of the liquor hot as the flames that had destroyed his only family he burned it skif repeated sitting up fists clenching word is that whoever he is jarmin shrugged then with a sly look pushed the jug toward skif skif pushed it back still dizzy but head getting clearer by the moment he burned it or ordered it burned whoever he is no warning of course jarmin continued casually because that would tip off the inspectors that he didnt mean to fix it and the highborn dont care how many of us burn so long as an inconvenient building is gotten rid of that is how it is there was light in the window and relative quiet on the street it must be day and the girls were asleep skif was still drunk and he knew it but he was getting sober more so with every breath as his anger rose and rose burning like the flames that had taken his family he looked down at himself and saw that he was still wearing the filthy clothing hed been brought here in the pile of clean stuff still lay at the foot of the pallet wanta bath jarmin comes with the room jarmin said indifferently ill tell madam get yourself downstairs when you can he descended the stairs and skif waited until he could stand without too much wavering then he picked up a shirt trews and socks and followed jarmin was behind the counter tending to a customer but waved him out the door skif tottered out blinking owlishly at the daylight and the door of the brothel next to jarmins shop opened an oilylooking fellow beckoned to him and skif went in he wasnt given any time to look around the shabbyluxurious parlor where customers came to choose from the girls if they hadnt already picked one the oily fellow hustled him into the back where there was a laundry only the remains of the liquor and the firmest of controls kept skif from breaking down right there and then the urge to wail was so great he practically choked there were several tubs two of which had girls in them three of which had laundry before he could lose his head and bawl a burly woman with workreddened hands and a tight angry mouth stripped him before he could open his mouth and shoved him into the last of the tubs she didnt give him a chance to wash himself either she used the same brush and lye soap that she used on the linen on his hide with the same lack of gentleness the bristles lacerated his skin his scalp he didnt let out a single sound as she scrubbed as if she intended to take his skin off then made him stand rinsed him with a bucket of water cold enough to make him gasp and bundled him in a sheet his own clothing went into one of the tubs with laundry in it and she handed him the plain trews socks and shirt he brought with him leaving him to clothe himself as she turned back to her work he noticed that the girls didnt get the same ungentle treatment they were allowed to bathe themselves and did so lazily completely ignoring his presence well that was all right he didnt want any stupid whores fussing over him like he was some sort of animate doll he didnt want their sympathy he didnt want anyones pity hard i gotta be hard thats what i gotta do he dried himself off the laundress snatched the sheet away from him before he could lay it down and popped it back into a tub and got the clothing on it was rather too big but that hardly mattered all he had left now were his own boots which he pulled on and left without a backward glance his head was clear enough now and while the laundress had scrubbed him his grief had somehow changed shrunk condensed down into a hard cold little gem that formed the core of a terrible anger that seemed almost too large to contain in so small a compass as his heart revenge that was what he wanted more than anything in the world and he wasnt going to rest until he got it he walked into jarmins shop and the old man gave him a sharp glance then a nod of satisfaction youll do was all he said and tossed him a pouch it clinked skif opened it and found a little money mostly copper a bit of silver he tucked it inside his shirt it was little enough jarmin was cheating him of course the room the food the clothing the baths none of that was worth a fraction of what hed stolen jarmin wasnt giving him anything and skif didnt want anything but this the expected cheating the usual grifting no more kindness no more generosity he could move on from here without looking back or regretting anything this was a business transaction for jarmin save one of the best thieves he knew and ensure a steady supply of goods for his shop as simple as that so he didnt thank the man for the money he just nodded curtly and went back out into the street he knew what the money was for tongues werent loose without money and skif was going to have to find a lot of tongues to loosen it was going to take a long time he already knew that that was fine too when revenge came it would come out of nowhere the enemy would never know who it was that hit him or why just as disaster had come upon him and with equal destruction in its claws when he was finished whoever had killed bazie would be left with nothing contemplating the wreckage of what had been his life with everything he valued and loved gone in an instant just like skif skif smiled at the thought it was the last smile he would wear for a very long time smoke drifted over the heads of the customers it wasnt from the fireplace but from the tallow dips set in crude clay holders on the tables and wedged into spaces between the bricks around the room skif sat as far from the door as it was possible to be in the odd corner of the broken arms a kind of rectangular alcove just before the walls met into which someone had wedged a brokenlegged stool making a seat hemmed in on three sides with brick the brick was newer here so this might be an old entrance gone now since the next building over was built right up against this one or maybe it had been a window slit you couldnt have used it as a door not really it was too short and too narrow maybe a former fireplace before the big one was put in before this room became a tavern no it wasnt big enough for a man to be comfortable sitting here but it was perfect for him here he could spend hours unnoticed the wenches had gotten so used to it being empty before things got so crowded hed bought himself a jack of small beer and a piece of bread and dripping so his stomach was full but not full enough to make him drowsy meanwhile the number of customers rose and the place got warmer this nook was a good place to tuck himself into when he wanted to eavesdrop on conversations eavesdropping was almost as good as paying for information and it cost nothing hed become adept at being able to sort one set of voices from all of the babble and concentrate on them once in a while one of the wenches would notice that he was there and like this afternoon hed buy a mugful of small beer and a piece of bread so that theyd leave him alone but that was only when the place was less than half full when it was crammed tight as it was now hed be overlooked all night hed already wedged himself up onto the seat knees just under his chin and his arms wrapped around them so not even his feet were in anyones way every bench and stool at every table was full not a surprise with rain coming down in barrel loads outside not a good night for business except within walls not that anyone in the arms was going to do any business that sign over the door wasnt there for a joke that was what made and kept the arms so popular when you walked in here you knew youd come out with your purse no lighter than the cost of your food and drink the women wouldnt try and get you drunk so they could talk you into paying for wine for them either the wenches here werent hired for their looks gods knew absolute harridans most of em theyd been hired because they knew the liftin lay and how to spot someone at business one whistle from one of them and the miscreant would find himself on the street with his own arms looking just like the ones on the sign it was a good dodge for the wenches for certainsure a young thing plain though she might be would still have an excuse to come sidling alongside of a fellow with a bit of an invitation an old hag wouldnt and though her fingers might still be wise they werent as nimble as a young things so if she tried the old dodge of stumbling into a fellow the odds were that hed be clapping his hand to his belt pouch before she could get into it and if he didnt and she got it her feet wouldnt carry her as far or as fast anymore the older you got in the trade the likelier it was youd be caught that fatal third time and unless she got herself a gaggle of littles to teach the trade to taking everything they lifted of course there wasnt much an aging woman could do to turn a penny there werent a lot of women who learned the high roads or the ketchin lay professions that could keep you going for a long time so long as you were limber enough to climb or bold enough to cosh not that skif held with the ketchin lay bazied turned up his nose at it didnt take a mort of skill nor brains to take a cosh to a fellows head and make off with his goods and the watch and the guards didnt give a third or even second chance to anyone caught at that trade caught once you saw ten years of hard labor for the guard the women skif knew didnt hold with the ketchin lay either though he wasnt sure what the difference was between laying a fellow out with a cosh and taking his goods when he was drunk dead asleep whatever that was still another trade and an old hag couldnt ply it either so it was good business all around for pappa serens he had the reputation now and always had himself a full complement of cheap serving wenches seeing as he gave them all bed space drink board and a couple of coppers now and again they got free access to the cheapest beer after closing as much as they cared to drink and to the dregs of every barrel and mug of whatever price during the hours of custom so long as they didnt get drunk every one of serens four girls had her own pottery pitcher back in the kitchen and no mug belonging to the tavern ever went back out to the custom without being drained every drop into one of those pitchers since by this point in their lives what they were mostly interested in was a warm bed and enough drink to knock them out every night nobody was complaining about the low wages the drinking killed them off of course but the moment that one was carried out the door on a board another came in on her own two feet to replace her serens supplied a unique commodity for this part of the city you could go to a dozen taverns to lift skirts to a dozen more for a cheaper drunk than you got here even to a couple for a bigger meal at the same price the arms however was the only place skif knew of where you could set yourself down without worrying about fingers at your belt pouch have beer that wouldnt choke you and a meal that wouldnt sicken you and talk about anything to anyone unmolested the wenches were ugly but they kept their mouths shut and their eyes on their own business there were occasional fights but it was generally some young bullyboy trying to prove something it usually went outside and the older wiser sellsword hed picked would settle him down quick enough and if it didnt go outside and racketed among the benches seren himself big as a bull and quick as a stag would settle it and the broken arms would have another gutterside advertisement of how the proprietor treated those who broke the rules tonight with waterfalls pouring from the clouds outside and the wind in the right direction so that the chimney drew properly instead of sending smoke into the room there wouldnt be any disturbances everyone was too comfortable to want to find himself out in the dark and rain skif could stay here tucked up until closing and he would right now his doss was a stable garret cheap enough and cool enough even by day now it was summer but boring worse with the rain pouring down itd lull him to sleep and mess him up he slept by day not by night and he didnt need to find himself starting to nod in the middle of a job because hed let his sleeping and waking patterns get messed up besides if he wasnt going to be able to work tonight he might as well see if he couldnt pick up something interesting in the months since the fire hed made some progress finding out who was responsible not anywhere near as fast as hed have liked but not so little that he was disappointed hed traced the money and responsibility up the line from the immediate landlord to whom theyd paid their rent through two middlemen both of whom were worse off for the loss of the building and neither of whom actually owned it there hed come to a deadend but someone had given orders it be burned and someone had carried out those orders and there werent too many who were in the business of burning down buildings skif had he thought identified them all he had no intention of going up to any of them and confronting them about it in the first place there was nothing he could offer in the way of a bribe or a threat to get them to talk in the second place doing so would likely get him dead not get him answers so he was taking the slow and careful path much though it irked and chafed him coming here as often as he could to listen to their talk for here was where all dubious business was conducted and here was where the one who was really responsible might come to commission another such job in point of fact as luck would have it one of skifs targets sat not a foot away from him tonight making it absurdly easy to pick out his words from amidst the babble all around him so far it had been nothing but idle talk of bets won and lost boasting about women tall tales of drinking bouts of the past on the other hand the man hadnt been talking to anyone but his cronies he was a professional and well enough off by the standards around here he didnt have to spend his evening in the arms he could get himself a woman have a boy deliver a good tavern meal to his room or find a better class of place to drink in so maybe just maybe hed come here tonight to make a contact or even a deal when he got up to ask someone at one of the twoperson tables if hed move to the seat he had just vacated for a monetary consideration and take his comrade with him skif felt a thrill of anticipation and apprehension he was meeting someone the door at the front of the tavern opened and closed and there was a subtle movement in the crowd it wasnt that the tavern patrons actually moved away from the newcomer but they did make room for him to pass they hadnt done that for anyone since skif had been sitting there which meant that whoever had come in was respected but not feared so he wasnt one of those halfcrazed bullies he wasnt someone that people feared could be set off into a rage but they gave him room you earned that here when the man made his way to skifs part of the tavern skif knew why people gave him room he didnt know the mans name but he knew the face closed craggy hard the man was a sellsword he didnt start quarrels but those that others started with him he finished and he was so good he never actually drew his sword when fights were picked with him after the third bullyboy to go outside with him wound up in the dust finished off by a man with two knives against their swords no one picked another fight with him defeat was one thing anyone could have a bad day and get beaten in a fight humiliation was another thing altogether you could live down a bad day you lived with humiliation forever if only inside your own head so nobody bothered this man anymore he took his seat at the little table across from skifs target with an attitude that said quite calmly that he had expected that the seat would be free and would be kept free for him but to skifs disappointment even though he strained his ears as hard as he could he couldnt make out anything more than an occasional word and none of them had anything to do with the fire rethwellan was one word vatean was another the first was a country somewhere outside of valdemar the second he recognized as a merchant a very wealthy merchant and a friend of the great lord orthallen skif still filched food from lord orthallen on a regular basis hed gone back to it in the wake of the fire after his three moons had run out it was hard to go back to the roof road and the liftin lay didnt pay enough for him to have a room buy drinks to loosen tongues and eat too so all this winter past hed lifted silks and fenced them lived in a little box of a garret room tucked into the side of the chimney of a bakehouse wonderfully warm through the rest of the winter that was and went back to mingling with the servants in lord orthallens household to get his food only now he knew far far more now he knew how to slip in and out of the household knew how to conceal more and what to conceal he knew what delicacies to filch and trade for entire meals of more mundane foodstuffs that perhaps was the best dodge with educated eyes he soon learned how to get into and out of the storage rooms without being caught the easiest way was to bribe one of the delivery boys to let him take what had been ordered to lord orthallens manse now these days he no longer bothered to disguise himself as a page while the cook or the butler was tallying what had come in on his pony cart he would carry foodstuffs into the storage room and leave a window unlocked then he would come back once the frantic work of preparing a meal had begun slip in help himself to whatever he wanted and slip out again he wasnt buying a lot of food anymore when the bakehouse room became unendurable in late spring he packed up his few possessions and found his new room over a stable that supplied goats and donkeys for delivery carts cheap enough with windows on both sides it caught a good breeze that kept it cool during the day while he was sleeping the animals went out each day at dawn when he got back from his work and came back at sunset by which time he was ready to leave the goats and donkeys took their pungent smells and noise with them and by the time he had finished eating and was ready to sleep there was nothing but the sound of the single stableboy cleaning pens and very little smell it was a good arrangement all around and if his landlord never asked what he did all night well he never asked why on nights of moondark a certain string of remarkably quiet donkeys with leather wrapped around their hooves went out when he did and arrived back by dawn by spring he had gone back to roof work although he kept his thefts modest and more a matter of opportunity than planning what he did mostly was listen for it was remarkable what information could be gleaned at open windows now that the weather was warm some of that he sold to others who trafficked in such information why should he care who paid to keep a secret love affair secret or who paid to avoid tales of bribery or cheating or other chicanery quiet it was all incidental to his hunt for bazies murderer but if he could profit by it then why not when a valuable trinket was left carelessly on a table in plain sight though it usually found its way into his pocket and then to a fence his own needs were modest enough that these occasional thefts combined with his information sales and gardenvariety raids on laundry rooms kept him in ready coin the beauty of it all was that the three activities were so disparate that no one who knew one of them was likely to connect him with the other two if it became too dangerous to filch silks he could step up his roof work if he somehow managed to get hold of some information that proved dangerous he could stop selling it and filch more laundry and if rumors of a clever sneak thief sent the watch around on heightened alert he could stop going for the trinkets and confine himself to listening at chimneys which sent up no smoke in this lovely weather but did provide wonderful listening posts unfortunately although he had cultivated acute hearing it wasnt good enough to enable him to hear what it was that the dour sellsword was saying however it did seem as if the man was buying not selling information when the surreptitious motion that marked the passing of coins from hand to hand finally took place it was the sellsword who passed the coins to skifs target and not the other way around might could be i could sell im a bit ifs lord orthallen hes wantin t hear about skif thought speculatively he decided to investigate chimneys at the manse at the next moondark they might prove to be useful fire he heard then which brought him alert again and he closed his eyes and put his head down the better to concentrate bad enough the sellsword grunted yeda seen me apassin buckets that night skifs target who skif knew as taln kelken but who the sellsword addressed as jass laughed shortly coulda bin rainin liketis now an yed nawt hev got it out he replied with a knowing tone reckon when a mun hev moren twenny barrels uv earth tar an wax painted on muns buildin take moren bucket lines tdouse it earth tar skif had heard rumors that the reason the fire had caught and taken off so quickly was because it had been tarred but this was the first hed heard of earth tar and wax ordinary pine tar or pitch as it was also called was flammable enough but the rarer earth tar which bubbled up from pits was much more flammable and to combine it with wax made no sense the concoction would have been hideously expensive unless the point was to turn the building into a giant candle only one person could know that about the fire the man whod set it now skif had that part of the equation and it took everything he had to stay right where he was and pretend he had dropped into a doze with his forehead on his knees anger boiled up in him no matter that he had pledged he would not do anything until he knew the real hand behind the fire the bullyboy sounded proud of himself smug and not the least troubled that whole families had died in that fire and others been made bereft parentless childless partnerless and my family gone all gone and just how would you know that the sellsword asked his tone was casual but there was anger under it as deep and as controlled as skifs the bullyboy didnt hear it so full of himself he was maybe only someone with matching anger would have it shocked skif and kept him immobile as mere caution could not have thatd be tellin wouldn it the bullyboy chuckled an thatd be tellin moren i care to less yeve got morev what brung ye here the sellsword just grunted curious is all he said as if he had lost interest don magine thlad as ordered that painted on is buildin would be too popular round here what a mun caint hev a coatve sumthin good put on is property thout folks takin it amiss the man known as both jass and taln said with feigned amazement why man thas whats painted on ships tmake em watertight mun got word inspectors werent happy e puts the best they is on yon buildin ist his fault some damnfool woman kicks over a cookstove an sets the thing ablaze afore he kin get th right surface ont proper you tell me the sellsword sneered evidently he didnt care much for the man he faced maybe talnjass couldnt tell it but there was thicklaid contempt in the sellswords voice the bullyboy laughed and skif seethed thatd be tellin an im too dry tbe tellin skif thought that this was a hint for the sellsword to buy his informant a drink but a scrape of stools told a different story this rain aint liftin afore dawn the arsonist said im off sweet dreams the sellsword said his tone full of bitter irony that wished the opposite laughter was his only answer skif opened his eyes to see his target turn and shove his way out through the crowd to the door the sellsword remained seated brooding then his back tensed he stood up slowly and deliberately and for a moment skif thought he was going to turn around to look behind him to see who might have been listening to the conversation skif shrank back into his alcove as far as he could go and tried to look sleepy and disinterested somehow he did not want this man to know that he had heard every bit of the last several moments but evidently the sellsword trusted in the unwritten rules of the arms he did not turn he only stood up and stalked back out through the crowd out the door and into the rain two tenants of a nearby more crowded table took immediate occupation of the little table and skif breathed a sigh of relief before he settled back into his smoldering anger because now that he knew who the tool was that tool would pay perhaps not immediately but he would pay when the rain died skif left there was still a drizzle going but not enough to keep him in the arms any longer his mind buzzed his anger had gone from hot to cold in which state he was able to think and think clearly somehow he had to find the next link in the chain the man who had paid for the arson but how loosen the bastards tongue thats what i gotta do as skif dodged spills out of waterspouts and kept when he could to the shadows he went over his options no point tryin to threaten im alone in his stable loft he could indulge himself in fantasies of slipping in at a window and taking the man all unaware of waking the scum with the cold touch of a knife at his throat but they were fantasies and skif knew it knives or no unaware or not the bullyboy was hard and tough and bigger than skif much bigger so what were his real options drink drugs not viable neither of them he couldnt afford enough of the latter to do any good and as for the former well hed seen that particular lad drink two men under the table and stagger out with his secrets still kept behind his teeth the closest he ever got to boasting was what hed done tonight just stick on im like a burr skif decided and ground his teeth it wasnt the solution he craved watch im an stick to im if he takes up summat to is rooms i gotta figger out which chimbley leads t his or suddenly an idea struck him that was so brilliant he staggered i don need all that dosh fer shakin loose words loose no more he knew who had set the fire so the money he had been using to pay bribes could be used for for a room in th bastards own place above below or to either side it didnt matter so long as skif had an adjoining surface he could rig the means to hear what was going on no matter how quiet the conversation was bribes werent all hed been paying for hed been getting lessons at spycraft how to follow someone and not be detected how to overhear what he needed to in fact so long as skif had a room anywhere in the arsonists boarding house hed be able to eavesdrop on the man it would just take a little more work that was all he lifted his face to the drizzle and licked the cool rain from his lips feeling that no wine could have a sweeter taste im gonna get you now he thought with glee an once i know what you know well knives werent the only weapons and poisons were a sight cheaper than tongueloosening drugs i don need a lotve room skif said to the arsonists scrawny illkempt landlord who looked down at him with disinterest in his watery blue eyes no cook space neither mebbe a chimbley an a winder but mostly just nuff room t flop i mebbe got somethin the landlord said at last skif nodded eagerly and did not betray in the slightest that he already knew the landlord had exactly what he wanted because skif had bribed the tenant of the highlydesirable room right next to his target to find lodgings elsewhere young lonar hadnt taken a lot of bribing he was sweet on a cookshop girl and wanted some pretties to charm her out of her skirts and into his bed skif simply lifted a handful of jingling silver bangles from a dressingtable placed too near an open window they were worth a hundred times to lonar what skif would have gotten for them fenced it had taken him time to work this out time in which his anger kept ice water flowing in his veins and sparked his brain to clever schemes first finding out the arsonists exact room next casing the place and discovering who his neighbors were then picking the most bribable and finally the bribe itself lonar had one room skif had even been in it several times already it was ideally suited for skifs purposes the back of the arsonists own fireplace and chimney formed part of one of the inner walls from the look of the brickedup back and the boardedup door in the same wall the room and the arsonists had once been part of a larger suite and the fireplace had been open between the two rooms giving each a common hearth ten copper a fortnight the landlord said tersely no cookin no fires chimbley oughter be enough tkeep ye warmo nights in answer skif handed over enough in copper and silver to pay for the next six moons and the man nodded in terse satisfaction this wasnt unusual behavior especially out someone who had no regular or obvious job when you were flush you paid up your doss for as long as you could afford when you werent you tried to sweettalk the landlord as long as possible then fled before he locked up your room and took your stuff probably he expected that skif would be gone by the end of those six moons be nice but i aint countin on it the landlord handed over a crude chit with an m for midwinter moon on it that was how long skif had if the landlord tried to cheat him by claiming hed paid for less time he could show it to a court to prove how long his tenancy was supposed to be there was of course no key to be handed over not in a place like this one tenants were expected to find their own ways of safeguarding their belongings some were more interesting than others skif pocketed his chit picked up his pack and bag and ran up the narrow stairs to the secondfloor landing three doors faced it his own was in the middle his room wasnt much bigger than a closet between the two sets of two rooms each on either side the door was slightly ajar and skif slipped inside quickly closing it behind him and dropping a bar across it the room itself wasnt much wider than the door lonar hadnt left anything behind but dirt the walls floor and ceiling were a uniform grime color impossible to tell if there was paint under the dirt closed shutters in the far wall marked the window from the amount of light leaking in around them it didnt look as if they were very weathertight not that it mattered skif wasnt here for the decor he was however here for the walls never mind how well the shutters fit it was the window itself that featured prominently in skifs plans he flung open the shutters to let air in and unrolled his pallet of blankets on the floor adding his spare clothing beneath as extra padding and untied the kerchief in which he had bundled the rest of his few belongings including the one very special object that he had gone to a lot of trouble to filch a glass a real glass he set it in the corner out of harms way and laid himself down on his pallet closing his eyes and opening his ears taking stock of his surroundings bazie would have been proud of him not a lot of street noise this house was on a deadend and most of the other places on the street also supplied rooms to let skif identified the few sounds coming from outside and ignored them one by one above him footsteps four perhaps five children of varying ages all barefoot a woman also barefoot that would be widder koil who made artificial flowers with paper and fabric presumably the children helped as well otherwise he couldnt imagine how she alone would earn enough to feed them all the voices drifted down from above edgy with hunger but not loud below nothing the firstfloor tenant was still asleep he was a night carter one of the few tenants here with a respectable and relatively wellpaying job to the left the wall with no fireplace four shrill female voices whores four sisters sharing two rooms relatively prosperous and without a protector they didnt need one the arsonist slept with at least two of them on a regular basis and no one wanted to chance his anger and to the right snores the chimney echoed with them not surprising like skif the arsonist worked at night the question was which of the two rooms was the mans bed skifs hope was that it was not the one with the fireplace but there was no way of telling if the man was snoring very loudly in the next room or not quite as loudly in the fireplace room at least i can hear him well there was nothing more to do now he let his concentration lapse and consciously relaxed the muscles of his face and jaw as he had learned to do when he wanted to sleep he would be able to learn more in a few candlemarks and when his target went out tonight so would he he woke all at once and knew why the window above his head showed a darkblue sky with a single star his room was shrouded in shadows and next door the snoring had stopped jasstaln was awake he sat up quickly and felt in the corner for his precious glass he put it up against the wall and put his ear against the bottom of it the man moved like a cat skif had to give him that much grudging credit he made very little noise as he walked around his rooms and unlike some people he didnt talk to himself no coughing no sneezing no spitting how ironic that a cold blooded murderer made such an ideal neighbor ideal unless of course you actually wanted to hear what he was up to now there was some noise in the fireplace skif frowned in concentration isolating the sounds whiffling shavings hitting the bricks the sound of a hand scraping the shavings together then putting them in the grate then the rattling and scratching of a handful of twigs a log coming down atop them a metallic clunk startled him though he should have expected it talnjass had just slapped a pan down onto the grill over his cooking fire a while later the sound of something scraping and rattling in the pan eating sounds frequent belches all of which were sweeter than any bards music to skifs ears the trick with the glass worked just as his teacher had claimed it would and it sounded as if the room with the fireplace was the arsonists public room for all of these noises were nearer than the snores had been which meant that when the man brought clients here for private discussions it would be the room nearest skif where those discussions would take place a fierce elation thrilled through him and he grinned with clenched teeth who needed drink drugs or even threats when you could listen to your target at will unnoticed now all he needed was time and patience and both were at last on his side although skif spatience was taxed to the uttermost by the lack of any concrete progress in his quest he at least was collecting a great deal of personal information on his neighbor jass the arsonist it soon developed had as many names as there were moons in the calendar not only was he known by the two skif knew but he was addressed variously as hodak by his landlord derial by the whores and various nicknames derived from the slight squint of one eye when he was thinking his ability to move silently the fact that a small piece was missing from his ear and some notveryclever but thoroughly obscene epithets that passed for humor among his acquaintances skif decided on jass easy to remember it had no associations for him other than his target but he was careful never to personally address the man at all much less by name since he wasnt actually supposed to know any of his names the few times they met on the stairs or the landing skif ducked his head subserviently and crammed himself to the wall to let the arsonist pass let jass think that skif was afraid of him all that meant was that jass had never yet gotten a look at anything other than the top of skifs head a man of many trades was jass over the course of three fortnights skif listened in to his conversations when he had someone with him in his rooms pillow talk and business talk and boasts when deep in his cups he wasnt just an arsonist if he had been hed have gone short more often than not as that wasnt a trade that he was called on to practice nearly often enough to make a living at it together with all four of the whores he practiced a variation on the ketchin lay where one of the girls would lure an unsuspecting customer into jass clutches where the wouldbe lecher soon found himself hit over the head and robbed he was also known for setting fires of course though so far since skif had moved in they were all minor acts of outrage designed to frighten shopkeepers into paying for protection from one of the three gangs he worked for or to punish those who had refused to do so on rare occasions he sold information most of which skif didnt understand but seemed to have to do with intrigues among some of the citys wealthier folk where he got these tidbits was a mystery to skif although there was a direct connection with the darker side of haven in that the information generally was about who among jasss cronies had been hired by one of the upright citizens and for what dirty job the craggyfaced sellsword was not the only one interested in jass information there were at least three other takers to skifs knowledge two of whom transacted their business only within the four walls of jasss fireplace room but to skifs growing impatience not once had jass been commissioned by the same person who had put him to igniting the tenement house skif might have learned more this summer brought a rash of tiny mysterious fires to blight the streets of haven but he had to eat too frustratingly he would sometimes return to his room after a night of roof walking only to hear the tail end of a conversation that could have been interesting or to hear jass himself come in after a long night of what skif seldom knew that was the frustrating part he might learn the next day of a fire that jass could have been responsible for or the discovery of a feckless fool lying coshed in an alley who had trusted in the blandishments of a face that drink made desirable that might belong to one of jass girls but unless jass boasted specifically there was no way of telling what could be laid at his door and not someone elses midsummer came and passed remarkable only for midsummer fairs and the fine pickings to be had at them and skif was no closer to uncovering the real culprit behind the fire day after day he would come awake in the damp heat of midday whit a jolt the moment that the snoring in the other room stopped and lie on his pallet listening swet prickled his scalp and he spread himself out like a starfish in a vain hope of finding a hint of cooler air he longed for the breezes of his stable loft but still he lay in the heat waiting for a word a clue a sign he had thought that he knew how to be patient as days became weeks and weeks tuned to moons he discovered he knew nothing at all about patience there was times when his temper snapped when he wanted to curse rail at fate and at the man who was so obstinately concealing his secrets to pound the floor and walls with his fists that he did not of these things was not a measure of his patience but rather that he did not dare to reveal himself to jass by an overheard gaffe of his own the more time passed the more his hatred grew bu at least he was not alone in hating and despising jass the sellsword was no friend to the arsonist either not if skif was any judge twice he had caught the man glaring at jass back with an expression that had made skifs blood turn cold twice only no more than that but the second time had been enough to convince skif that the first was no fluke whatever he had done to earn the sellswords enmity skif was certain that only the fact that jass was and remained useful to the man that kept jass alive and unharmed one stifling day skif lay on the bare boards of his room dressed in nothing more than a singlet eyes closed and a wet cloth lying across them in an attempt to bring some coolness to his aching head he could only breathe in the furnacelike air and reflect absently on how odd it was that this part of town actually stank less than some betteroff neighborhoods but that was simply because here where there was nothing everything had a value even nightsoil was saved and collected tannery prentices came round to collect urine every morning paying two clippedpennybits a pot and the rest went straight into backgarden compost heaps people who had birds or pigs collected their leavings for their gardens and as for the dung from horses and donkeys well it was considered so valuable that it barely left the beasts bum before someone scuttled out to the street and scooped it up nothing went to waste here no matter how rotten food was it went into somethings belly as a consequence the only stench coming off these streets and alleys was of sweat and grime and stale beer but nothing worse than that why skif could hardly bear to walk in the alley of a merchants neighborhood in this weather jass snores still echoed up the chimney how could the man sleep in heat like this the faintest breath of air moved across the floor drifting from the open window to crawl under the crack beneath the door drops of sweat trickled down skifs neck and crept along his scalp without cooling him appreciably a fly droned somewhere near the ceiling circling around and around and bumping against the grimestreaked paint in a mindless effort to get beyond it it could have flown out the window of course but it was determined to find a way through to the next story of the house no matter how unlikely a prospect that seemed skif felt a curious kinship with the fly at the moment his own quest seemed just about as futile and he was just as stupidly bullheadedly determined not to give it up he wondered if perhaps just perhaps he ought to start spending the day somewhere other than here somewhere in a cellar perhaps where he would be able to doze in blessed coolness so long as he managed to awaken before jass did and get back here but as sure as he did that jass would change his habits and start sleeping at least in part by night so that he could conduct some of his business by daylight at least im savin money on eats he thought wryly in this heat he had no appetite to speak of and spent most of his food money on peppermint tea it was easy enough to make without a fire just put a pot full of water and herb packets on the windowsill in the sun and leave it to brew all day and it cooled the mouth and throat if not the body skif found himself thinking longingly of rain a good thunderstorm would cool the city down and wash the heaviness out of the air rain was his enemy he wouldnt couldnt work in the rain but it would be worth not working for one night in weather like this anyone who could afford to went off into the country anyway houses were shut up furniture swathed in sheets valuables taken away with the rest of the household goods only those few whose duties kept them here remained lord orthallen for one he was on the council and couldnt leave which was just as well for skifs sake since his larder was supplying skifs peppermint and the sugar to sweeten it next door the snoring stopped jass was awake at last no sounds of cooking this past fortnight jass was eating out of cookshops rather than add to the heat in his rooms by lighting a fire within moments skif knew that there was no point in lingering around this afternoon jass would be going out and probably not returning until after nightfall if then no point in skif staying inside either he wasnt going to sleep not here he might as well see if there was somewhere anywhere in the city where there was a breath of cooler air in loose breeches barefoot and with his shirtsleeves rolled up he was soon out into the street where virtually everyone looked just as uncomfortable and listless as he for once the narrow streets proved a blessing not much sun got past the buildings to bake the pounded dirt and add to the misery it occurred to him that temples constructed of thick stone just might harbor some lingering coolness in their walls in fact the temples over in wealthier parts of haven usually had crypts beneath them which would certainly be as cool as any wine cellar and a deal quieter aye but then i get preached at or i get asked what i want they find me i the crypt they run me out sure as sure them priests is like ants always where ye don want em wisht i could find me a temple crypt wi nawt about well maybe he could there were plenty of the highborn who had their own chapels and private crypts too in the city cemeteries there hed run little risk of being disturbed some might have second thoughts about seeking a nap among the dead but skif wasnt one of them a candlemark later skif slipped down the stairs of a private chapel in one of the cemeteries reserved for the highborn the chapel was above where those who were queasy about any actual contact with the dead could pray skif headed down into the family crypts said lordling was gone the house shut up with only a couple ol maids and an old dragon of a housekeeper so there wouldnt be any impromptu visits by the family the chapel had been locked but that was hardly going to stop skif hed picked this place in particular because the family was known for piety and familial pride and because there hadnt been a death in more than a year napping among the dead was one thing napping among the recentlyinterred was another and family pride skif hoped would have seen to it that the crypt was kept clean and swept he didnt mind the dead but spiders were something else and gave him the real horrors it was darker than the inside of a pocket down here but his hunch had been right it was blessedly cool and he pressed his overheated body up against the cold marble walls with relief while he waited for his eyes to adjust some light did filter down the staircase from the chapel windows above and eventually skif was able to make out the dim shape of a stone altar laden with withered flowers against the back wall he sniffed the air carefully and his nose was assaulted by nothing worse than dust and the ghosts of roses there were two rows of tombs each bearing the name and station of its occupant graven atop it no statues here this family wasnt quite lofty enough for marble images of its dead adorning the tombs skif yawned and felt his way to the stone table at the back of the chapel meant for flower offerings just in case someone came down here he planned to take his nap in the shadows beneath it stone didnt make a particularly yielding bed but hed slept on stone plenty of times before this it would be no worse than sleeping on the floor of his uncles tavern and a lot quieter he was very pleased to note that his hunch had paid off even beneath the table there wasnt much dust he laid himself out in the deep shadow with his back pressed against the wall and his head pillowed on his arm the stone practically sucked the heat right out of his body and in moments for the first time in days he fell into a deep and dreamless sleep it seemed only heartbeats later that something jolted him awake he froze his eyes snapping open and saw the wavering light of a single candle illuminating the staircase he had only just crept down yer certainsure there aint gonna be nobody here thats jass skif thought in shock whats he doing here surely not grave robbing the amount of work it would take to get into one of these tombs was far beyond anything the jass that skif knew would be willing to do even supposing there was anything of value interred there im quite sure said a smooth and cultured voice rovenar and his family are at his country estate and none of his fathers friends are still alive to pay him a graveside visit besides it would hardly matter if anyone did come i have the key rovenar trusts me to see that no one gets in here to work any mischief in his absence if anyone should appear i am simply doing him that favor and you my servant have accompanied me servant jass growled it was amazing how well the stairs worked to funnel sound down here skif would have thought they were in the same room with him the voice laughed bodyguard then the voice was clearly amused at jass attitude toward being taken as a servant it occurred to skif that if he was seeing the light of a candle up there it must be later than hed thought when he was initially startled awake it must have been the turning of the key in the lock on the chapel door that woke him and he blessed the owner who had put in a door that locked itself on closing whatever brought jass and the unknown gentleman here it had to be something out of the ordinary whatd ye want t meet here for jass grumbled place fair gives me th creeps it is cool it is private and we stand no chance of being overheard the voice replied and because i have no mind to pay a call on you i pay you you can accommodate yourself to me skif winced nothing could have been clearer than the contempt in those words but either jass was inured to it or he was oblivious to it mebbe he just dont care anyone whod been entrusted with the key to a lordlings chapel had to have money at least and the song of that money must ring in jasss ears deafening him to anything else so wuts th job this time that you don want ears about jass asked bluntly it better pay better nor last time it will the voice said coolly not that you werent paid exactly what the last job was worth and i suspect you made somewhat more afterward im given to understand that you are considered something of an information broker ye never give me enuff fer quiet jass said sullenly skif felt as if hed been struck by lightning bloody ell thiss where jass gets is stuff about th highborns i dont pay for what i dont require the voice countered just remember that and remember that when i do pay for silence i expect it dont disappoint me jass youll find im a different man when ive been disappointed a shiver ran down skifs back at the deadly menace of that voice and he was astonished that jass didnt seem to hear it himself jass was either oblivious or arrogant and neither suggested hed be enjoying life for very much longer unless he realized he was treading on perilous ground th job he simply prompted impatiently quite as if he was the one in charge and not his client simple enough the smooth cultured voice replied another fire like the one i commissioned last winter but this time i dont want any cleverness on your part no earth tar no pine tar no oil or mineral spirits nothing to encourage the blaze the warehouse will be left open for you so start it from the inside skif froze he couldnt have moved to save his life there it was everything hed been looking for except that he couldnt see who jass was talking to and hed never heard that voice before jass growled aint gonna burn good he complained might even save it if nonsense the voice replied firmly in this heat and as dry as its been itll go up like chaff people were suspicious the last time jass there were enquiries i had a great deal of covering up to do it was exceedingly inconvenient for me a considerable amount of totally unexpected work whats more some of that work went to saving your neck some of the tenants didnt get out and if the fire had been traced back to you theyd have hanged you for murder jass actually laughed but it had a nasty sound to it well they didnt did they thas cuz there werent no witnesses i seen t that thas why people didn all get out cause i quieted em skifs heart turned to ice and that is supposed to show me how clever you are the man snorted youre very good at what you do jass and my lord orthallen gave you high recommendations but youve become arrogant and careless stick to what youre told to do dont try to be clever and if you get caught ill wash my hands of you dont think i wont jest gimme th job jass growled and the voice related details and instructions jass thinks if es caught e kin turn is coat an tell on milord there savin is own neck but skif was listening as jass was not and he knew that if jass was ever caught his life wasnt worth a bent pin if there was even the chance that the watch was on to jass his employer would ensure his silence in the most effective way possible it wouldnt take much just another interview in an outoftheway place like this one only jass would not be meeting milord and there would be an extra corpse in the cemetery there was a metallic chink as money passed from one hand to another and jass counted it remember what i said the voice warned one set of footsteps marked the owners transit to the door of the chapel and jass got up to follow dont get creative just set the fire and get out awright awright jass sneered my lord the light vanished the candle must have been put out the door swung quietly open on welloiled hinges with only a faint sigh of displaced air to mark it opening then it shut again with a hollow sound and the key rattled in the lock es gettin away i dunno oo e is an es gettin away skif practically flew up the stairs no longer caring if he was discovered so long as he could see who that voice belonged to too late not only were they gone he couldnt even hear footsteps he flung himself at the windows hopeless not only was it dark outside but the windows didnt open and they were made of colored glass as well there was no way he could see anything through them except for one single blob of light a lantern perhaps receding into the darkness he returned to the door but you couldnt just open it from within once you got inside it had to be unlocked from the inside as well as from the outside cursing under his breath he got out his lock picks again knowing that this would cost him yet more time in the dark and fumbling in his hurry he cursed his clumsy fingers and the lock picks that suddenly turned traitor on him at last he heard the click of the tumblers and wrenched the wretched door open there wasnt a single light to be seen within the four walls of the cemetery theyd gotten far enough away that they were out of sight among the tombs and by now jass and his employer would have gone their separate ways with nothing to show the connection between them nothing to prove that milord wasnt just paying a sentimental or pious visit on the anniversary of someones death no skif wasnt going to give up that easily from here there was only a single path winding among the chapels crypts and trees and skif tore up it there were only two entrances and he thought he knew which one milord would take he had to catch the man before he left the cemetery he had to he had to know with his heart pounding and his eyes burning with rage he abandoned everything but the chase at a point where two private chapels faced one another across the path where he might have slowed just in case there was someone lurking in the shadows he only sped up and at the last moment as he passed between them too late to avoid the ambush he sprung a trap on himself a trap that took the form of a cord stretched at kneeheight along the path skif hit it and went flying facefirst into the turf the impact knocked the breath out of him and left him stunned just long enough for the ambusher to get on top of him and pin him down he fought but his opponent was twice his size and had probably forgotten more dirty tricks than skif knew ruthless methodical he made short work of one young boy before he could catch the breath that had been knocked out of him by the fall skif found himself gagged his hands tied behind his back pulled to his feet and shoved into one of those two chapels the door shut with an ominous brazen clang skifs feet were kicked out from beneath him before he could lash out at his captor and he went to the floor like a sack of meal there was a rattle of metal and the shutter of a dark lantern opened skif blinked eyes watering at the light as the craggy sellsword who had bought so much information from jass peered down at him well well a trap for a fox i set and i catch a rabbit the man said looking down at skif with no humor in his face whatsoever he wasnt talking like one of the denizens of havens rough streets anymore he had an accent that skif couldnt place now why is it i wonder that wherever i find jass also you i find skif glared at him over the gag daring him to try something not that he had the slightest idea of what he was going to do if the man made a move but the man only stooped swiftly and seized one of skifs ankles kick as hard as he could skif could do nothing against the mans greater strength at the cost of a bump on the head that made him see stars he gained nothing and found himself with both ankles trussed and tied to his wrists which were in turn tied behind his back only then did the man take off the gag taking care not to let his hands get within range to be bitten he squatted easily beside skif sitting on his heels i believe its time speech we have you and i he said frowning and it is that i hope for your sake that you arent jass errand boy he stared hard at skif for a long time skif worked his jaw silently and continued to glare at him although he was beginning to feel a little odd as if there was something messing about inside his head so if e wants ter talk why dont eget on wi it he thought furiously and at that exact moment the man smiled grimly and nodded to himself what were you doing here the sellsword asked as soon as skifs mouth was clear of the threads the cloth had left on his tongue sleepin skif spat and snarled in impotent fury if it hadnt been for this bastard hed have found out who jass employer was he made up his mind not to tell the man one word more than he had to in a cemetery the man raised one eyebrow skif found angry words tumbling out of his mouth despite his resolution not to talk whas it matter tyou or them theys not gonna care an its a damn sight cooler an quieter here than anywheres else them highborns is all playin out icountry they aint gonna know f i wuz here you have a point the man conceded then his face hardened again but why is it that you just happen sleeping to be in the same place where jass goes to have a little chat how shud i know skif all but wailed i drops off next thing i knows hes up there yappin t summun an i wanta know who if hed had his hands free hed have clapped both of them over his mouth in horror his tongue didnt seem to be under his control what was happening to him oh really the mans other eyebrow arched toward his hairline and why is that becuz jass the bastid what set th big fire an burned me out an the mun whut was with im wuz th mun what paid im t do it skif heard himself saying frantically i knowd it cuz i eerd im say so is boss set im another fire t start right whiles i was listenin an i wanta know who he is cuz im gonna get im an then im gonna get jass an enough the man held up a swordcallused palm and skif found his flood of angry words cut off again just in time too there had been tears burning in his eyes and he didnt want the man to see them he blinked hard to drive them away but he couldnt do much about the lump in his throat that threatened to choke him wut in hell is happenin to me but the man darted out a hand quick as a snake and grabbed skifs shoulder and shook it that hand crushed muscle and bone and hurt now to me you listen boy and engrave my words on your heart you will the man said leaning forward until all skif could see were his hawksharp hawkfierce eyes you playing are in deeper waters than you know and believe me to swim in them you cannot hope your nose out of this you keep or likely someone is to fish you out of the terilee with a rock around your ankles tied if find you at all they do skif shuddered convulsively and an involuntary sob fought its way out of his throat the man sat back on his heels again satisfied jass will to worry about shortly much more than the setting of fires have the man said darkly and he will answer for the many things he has responsible been for but that is all you need to know the man said forcefully and the words froze in skifs throat the sellsword pulled out a knife and for one horrible moment skif thought that he was dead but the man laid it on the floor just out of reach and stood up too clever you are by half he said with a grim little smile now about my business i will be the moment i leave getting yourself loose you can be about manage you will quite sure i am he dropped the shield over the dark lantern plunging the chapel into complete blackness in the next moment although skif hadnt heard him move the door opened a tall lean shadow slipped through it and it closed again skif lost no time in wriggling over the stone floor to the place where the man had left the knife when he was right on top of it he wriggled around until he could grab it as soon as he got it into his hands he sawed through the cord binding his wrists to his ankles not easy but not impossible the man had left him enough slack in his ropes to do just that once that was cut he managed to contort his body enough to get his arms back over to the front of himself and then sawed through the bindings at ankle and wrist it was a good knife sharp and well cared for if it didnt cut through the cords holding him as if they were butter he wasnt forced to hack at them for candlemarks either but all the time his hands were working his mind was too who and what was that man how had he managed to get skif to tell him everything he knew why did he want to know so much about jass whyd e lemmego whyd e warn me off not that skif had any intention of being warned off oos e think e is anyroad oos e think e was talkin to if there was one thing that skif was certain of it was his own expertise in his own neighborhood however clever this man thought he was he wasnt living right next door to his target now was he he hadnt even known that jass was the one whod set that fire skif had seen a flicker of surprise when his own traitorous mouth had blurted that information out he might think himself clever but he wasnt as good as all that but owd e make me talk more to the point could he do it again if he got skif in his hands best not to find out e won catch me a second time skif resolved fiercely as he cut through the last of the cords on his wrists and shook his hands free he stood up sticking the knife in his belt no point in wasting a good blade after all his anger still roiled in his gut by now jass was far off and his employer probably safe in his fancy home ill know is voice though if i ever hear it agin small consolation but the best he had he slipped out the door of the chapel and closed it behind himself not caring if he left this one unlocked or not around him the dead kept their silence with nothing to show that there had ever been anyone here crickets sang and honeysuckle sent a heavy perfume across the carefully manicured lawn jass had picked a good night for a clandestine meeting the moon was no bigger than a fingernail paring skif made his way to the spot where the wall was overhung by an ancient goldenoak he hadnt come in by a gate and he didnt intend to leave by one either all the while his mind kept gnawing angrily on the puzzle of the sellsword bastid oos e t be so high i th nose man sells anythin es got t whosever gots the coin hadnt he already proved that by buying information from jass an wuts e gonna do anyroad wheres e get off tellin me jasss gonna go down fer the fire why shud e care unless he had a wealthy patron himself maybe someone who had lost money when the fire gutted skifs building or maybe jass own employer was playing a double game covering his bets and his own back hiring someone to find out who set the fire so that jass got caught the rich man could prove that he had gone far out of his way to try and catch the arsonist then no matter what jass said who would believe him the thought didnt stop skif in his tracks but it only roiled his gut further the bastards they were all alike those highborns and rich men and their hirelings they didnt care who paid so long as their pockets were welllined skif swarmed up the tree by feel edged along the branch that hung over the opposite side and dropped down quietly to the ground his heart on fire with anger revenge thats what he wanted and he knew the best way to get it too if he didnt have a specific target he could certainly make all of them suffer at least a little just wait until they all came back from their fancy country estates wait until they returned and came back not just to things gone missing but to cisterns and sewers plugged up wells and chimneys blocked linens spoiled moths in the woolens mice in the pantry and rats in the cellar hed cut sash cords block windows so they wouldnt close right drill holes in rooftops and in water pipes it would be a long job but he had all summer and when he got through with them the highborn of valdemar would be dead certain that theyd been cursed by an entire tribe of malevolent spirits no time like right now neither he thought with smoldering satisfaction as he fingered the sharp edge of his new knife so what if he didnt have a specific target they were all alike anyway so hed make it his business to make them all pay if it took him the rest of his life skif had every intention of beginning his campaign of sabotage that very night but when he tried to get near the district where the homes of the great and powerful were he found the watch was unaccountably active there were patrols on nearly every street and they werent sauntering along either something had them alerted and after the third time of having to take cover to avoid being stopped and questioned he gave it up as hopeless and headed back to his room with an ill grace he got some slight revenge though as he turned a corner a party of welldressed and very drunk young men came bursting out of a tavern with a very angry innkeeper shouting curses right on their heels they practically ran him over but in the scuffle and ensuing confusion he lifted not one but three purses making impotent threats and shouting curses of his own at them which had all the more force because of his personal frustrations he turned on his heel and stalked off in an entirely different direction once out of sight he ducked into a shadow emptied the purses of their coins into his own pouch and left the purses where he dropped them tucking his pouch into the breast of his tunic then he strolled away in still another direction after a block or two there was nothing to connect him with the men hed robbed that was a mistake that many pickpockets made they hung onto the purses theyd lifted granted such objects were often valuable in themselves certainly the three hed taken had been but they also gave the law a direct link between robber and robbed as he walked back toward his room he managed to get himself back under control taking the purses had helped it was a very small strike against the rich and arrogant bastards but a strike nevertheless just wait till they get to a bawdy house an theyve gotta pay he thought with grim satisfaction they better ope their friends is willin t part with th glim skif had seen the wrath of plenty of madams and whoremasters whose customers had declined to pay and they didnt take the situation lightly nor did they accept promissory notes they also employed very large men to help enforce the house rules and tariffs when young men came into a place in a group no one was allowed to leave until everyones score had been paid those who still had purses would find them emptied before the night was over the thought improved his humor and that restored his appetite now much fatter in the pocket than he had been this afternoon he decided to follow his nose and see where it led him it took him to a cookshop that stood on the very border of his neighborhood halfway between the semirespectable district of entertainers artists musicians not bards of course peddlers and decorative craftsmen and their prentices and his own less respectable part of town ive earned a meal he declared taking care not to expose how much he had he fished out one of the larger coins from his loot and dropped the pouch back into his tunic best to get rid of the most incriminating of the coins he eased on in it was full but not overcrowded and he soon found space at the counter to put in his order with a bowl of soup and a chunk of bread in one hand and a mug of tea in the other he made his way back outside to the benches in the open air where there were others eating talking or playing at dice or cards hot as it was there were more folk eating under the sky than under the roof as was his habit he took an outoftheway spot and kept his head down and his ears open he was very soon rewarded the place was abuzz with the rumor that someone had broken into the home of the wealthy merchant trenor severik and had stolen most of his priceless collection of miniature silver figurines severik had literally come home in time to see the thief vanishing out the window hence the watch every man had been called out the neighborhood had been sealed off and anyone who couldnt account for himself was being arrested and taken off to gaol it seemed that one of those arrested was an acquaintance of several of those sitting near skif hard luck for poor korwain one of the artists said with a snicker he couldnt say where hed been of course his friends nearly choked on their meals i told him that woman was trouble said another whose dusty beard and hair bedecked with stone chips proclaimed him to be a sculptor two sittings and shes got me backed into a corner tryin to undo mbritches he shuddered and the rest laughed patron of arts she calls herself my eye heyla we tried to warn you so dont say we didnt called a fellow with a lute case slung over his back korwain knew it so hes only got himself to blame thats what happens when you let greed decide your commissions for you put in another whose mouth looked like a misers purse and whose eyes gloated at a fellow artists misfortune id rather live on bread in a garret and serve the temples than feast on marchpane and capon and your paintings are so stiff they wouldnt please anyone but a priest so dont go all over pious on us penchal catcalled the first artist that set off an argument on artistic merit and morality that skif had no interest in he applied himself to his soup and left the bowl and mug on the table while the insults were still coming thick and fast and rapidly building to the point where it would be fists and not words that would be flying at least now he knew why the watch was up and he wouldnt dare try anything for days even a fortnight why would anyone bother to steal the collection of silver miniatures anyway they were unique and irreplaceable yes but youd never be able to sell them anywhere they were too recognizable and you wouldnt get a fraction of their value if you melted them down oh a thief could hold them for ransom skif supposed but hed certainly be found out and caught the only way the theft made sense was if someone had gotten a specific commission to take them it was an interesting thought whoever had made the commission would have to be from outside haven what was the use of having something like that if you couldnt show it off anyone in haven would know the collection as soon as it was displayed the client could even be outside valdemar altogether so the thief too might be from outside valdemar huh thatd be something he thought keeping an eye out for trouble as he made his way back home haveta be some kinda master thief i guess somebody with all kinds uv tricks wonder if theys prentices fer that kinda work hed never heard of a master thief much less one that took on proteges but maybe that sort of thing happened outside of valdemar like mebbe theys a whole guild fer thieves wouldn that be somethin he amused himself with this notion as he worked his way homeward he never even when he had no reason to believe that he was being followed went back home directly he always doubled back ducked down odd side passages even cut over fences and across back gardens though in the summer that could be hazardous in his neighborhood no one had a back garden for pleasure people used every bit of open ground to grow food in and often kept chickens pigeons or a pig as well and they assumed anyone coming over the fence was there to steal some of that precious food those that didnt have yards but did have balconies grew their vegetables in pots those that had nothing more than a window had window boxes even skif had a window box where he grew beans trailing them around his window on a frame made of pieces of string it was just common sense to augment what you could buy with what you could grow but that did make it a bit more difficult to take the roundabout path until after the growing season was over it wasnt as late as hed thought lots of people were still up and about making it doubly hazardous to go jumping in and out of yards the front steps of buildings held impromptu gatherings of folks back from their jobs eating late dinners and exchanging gossip most of the inns and cookshops had put benches out onto the street so people could eat outside where it was cooler it was annoying skif couldnt take his usual shortcuts on the other hand so many people out here meant more opportunities to confuse a possible follower with that in mind he stopped at another cookshop for more tea and a fruit pie more crust than fruit be it added but he didnt usually indulge in anything so frivolous and the treat improved his temper a bit more not so much that he forgot his anger and the burning need to find out who jass boss was but enough so that he was able to look as though nothing in his life had changed in the last few candlemarks he paid close attention to those who sat down to eat after him but saw no one that had also been at the previous cook shop that was a good sign and he quickly finished his tea and took the shortest way home jass wasnt back yet neither were his girls which meant that jass probably wasnt going to set his fire tonight skif watered his beans and stripped for bed lighting a stub of a candle long enough to actually count his takings his eyes nearly popped out of his head and he counted it twice more before he believed it gold five gold crowns more than hed ever had in his life hed thought the tiny coins were copperbits not gold and hed paid for his meal and his treat with larger silver royals so as to get rid of two of the most conspicuous coins in his loot hed never dreamed the men could have been carrying gold gold gold meant everything with gold he suddenly had the means to concentrate entirely on finding bazies murderer he wouldnt have to work the entire summer with gold he had the means to offer the kind of bribe that would loosen even the most reluctant of tongues with gold he could follow up on the only real clue he had that wasnt connected to jass my lord orthallen gave you high recommendations gold could actually buy skif a way into orthallens household you didnt just turn up at a great lords doorstep and expect to be hired you had to grease palms before you got a place where you could expect to have privileges maybe even collect tips for exemplary service gold would purchase forged letters of commendation very rarely did anyone ever bother to check on those especially if they were from a household inconveniently deep into the countryside those letters could get skif into say a position as an undergroom or a footman a place where hed be in contact with lord orthallens guests friends and associates where he could hear their voices this one encounter changed everything maybe it was one plan there were others that would allow skif to hang onto the unexpected windfall jass wouldnt have been paid for the job entirely in advance hed have to collect the rest and maybe skif could catch him at it there were other places where skif could go to listen for that familiar smooth and pitiless voice but the idea of insinuating himself into a noble household was the kind of plan that the craggyfaced sellsword would not be able to anticipate if he knew anything at all about skif hed know that in the normal course of things pigs would fly before someone like skif would get his hands on enough money to buy his way into lord orthallens household so skif carefully folded the five gold coins into a strip of linen and packed them with his larger silver coins in the money belt that never left his waist then he blew out his candle laid himself down and began his nightly vigil of listening for jass and jass business because while gold might add to his options if bazie had taught him anything at all it was to never ever abandon an option just because a new one opened up but jass didnt come back that night nor the next day skif fell asleep waiting to hear his footsteps on the stairs and woke the next morning to the unaccustomed sound of silence next door he waited all day wondering with increasing urgency what was keeping the man from his own rooms by nightfall though he knew why at dusk a threeman team of the watch came for jass two girls escorting them off rather than taking them off under guard so it wasnt that they were arrested or under suspicion skif was at his window when they showed up and he knew before they ever came in view that something was wrong for the whole street went quiet people whisked themselves indoors or around corners anything to get out of sight and even the littles went silent and shrank back against their buildings stopping dead in the middle of their games and staring with round eyes at the three men in their blueandgray tunics and trews the watch never came to this part of town unless there was something wrong or someone was in a lot of trouble skif ducked back out of sight as soon as they came into view and when he heard the unmistakable sound of boots on the staircase huddled against the wall next to the door so that no one peering underneath it would see his feet whatre they here for for me did that feller turn me in did summun figger i lifted them purses his mind raced reckoning the odds of getting out via his emergency route through the window if theyd come for him wondering if that sellsword had somehow put the watch onto him and if he had why the footsteps stopped at his landing and his heart was in his mouth his blood pounding in his ears every muscle tensed to spring for the window but it wasnt his door they knocked on and they knocked politely rather than pounding on it and demanding entrance it was the girls door and when one of them timidly answered an embarrassed voice asked if trana and desi farane would be so kind as to come down to the watchstation and answer a few questions skif sagged down onto the floor limp with relief whatever it was it had nothing to do with him now everyone knew that if the watch had anything on you they didnt come and politely invite you to the watch station when someone came with that particular request it meant that you werent in trouble though someone else probably was but if you were asked to come answer questions and you refused well you could pretty much reckon that from then on you were marked and anytime one of the watch saw you theyd be keeping a hard eye on you and theyd be likely to arrest and fine you for the least little thing so after a nervoussounding unintelligible twitter of a conversation among all four of the sisters trana and desi emerged and five sets of footsteps went back down the staircase now he had to see what was up when skif peeked out around the edge of the window he saw that two of the watch were carrying lit lanterns making it very clear that the two girls werent being manhandled or even touched and he could see that the two girls had taken long enough to lace their bodices tight pull up their blouses and drop their skirts where they were usually kirtled up to show their ankles they were definitely putting on a show of respectability which only made sense that was the last he saw of them until just before dark they returned alone but gabble in the street marked their arrival waking skif from a partial doze their sisters must have been watching from the window they flew down the stairs to meet them and half the neighborhood converged on them skif took his time going downstairs and by then the block was abuzz with the news that jass had been found dead in a warehouse that afternoon and the girls had been brought in to identify the body there was no question but that he was the victim of foul play hed been neatly garroted and his body hidden under an empty crate he might not even have been found except that someone needed the crate and came to fetch it uncovering this body damn skif couldnt quite believe it couldnt quite take it in dead but by the time skif drifted to the edge of the crowd to absorb the news trana and desi were sobbing hysterically though how much of their sorrow was genuine was anyones guess skif had the shrewd notion that they were carrying on more for effect than out of real feeling their sisters with just as much reason to be upset looked more disgruntled at all of the attention that trana and desi were getting than anything else skif huddled on the edge of the crowd trying to overhear the details there werent many he felt numb as if hed been hit by something but hadnt yet felt the blow before a quarter candlemark had passed the landlord appeared he had tools and his dimwitted helper he pushed past the crowd and ran up the stair the sounds of hammering showed he was securing the door of jass room with a large padlock and hasp an entire parade led by the girls followed him up there where he was standing lantern in one hand snapping the padlock closed there may be inquiries he said officiously when desi objected claiming that shed left personal belongings in jass rooms if the watch or the guard wants to inspect this place ill be in trouble if i let anyone take anything out there wouldnt be any inquiries and they all knew it this was just the landlords way of securing anything of value in there for himself but if they knew what i knew skif thought as he closed and bolted his own door and put his back to it he began to shake of all the people who could have wanted jass dead the only one with the money to get the job done quietly was the smoothvoiced man in the cemetery what had the sellsword said youre in deeper waters than you can swim or something like that deep waters his knees went weak at how close hed come last night to joining jass under that crate if hed been caught down in that crypt skif sat down on his bedroll and went cold all over there was at least one person in haven who knew that there was a connection between skif and jass and that craggyfaced sellsword just might come looking for him to find out exactly what and how much skif knew i got to get out of here now the thought galvanized him it didnt take him long to bundle up his few belongings more and r ore people were showing up to hear the news directly from the girls and the more people there were moving around the better his odds were of getting away without anyone noticing he watched for his chance and when a group of their fellow lightskirts descended on desi and trana and carried them off to the nearest tavern the better to console them he used the swirl of girls and the clatter they generated to his advantage he slipped out behind them stayed with them as far as the tavern and then got moving in the opposite direction as quickly as he could he didnt really have any ideas of where he was going but at the moment that was all to the good if he didnt know where he was going no one else would be able to predict it either the first place that anyone would look for him would be here of course but as skif trudged down the street looking as small and harmless as he could manage he put his mind to work at figuring out a place where someone on his track was not likely to look what was the most out of character for him well a temple but i don think im gonna go lookin t take vows was his automatic thought but then suddenly that didnt seem so outlandish a notion not taking vows of course but abruptly he altered his path this was going to be a long walk but he had the notion that in the end it was going to be worth it skif made his eyes as big and scared as he could and twisted his cap in his hands as he waited for someone to answer his knock at the temple gate this temple was not the one where his cousin beel was now a full priest it wasnt even devoted to the same god much less the same order this was the temple and priory of thenoth the lord of the beasts and this order took it on themselves to succor and care for injured sick and aged animals from sparrows and pigeons to brokendown carthorses it existed on charity and as such was one of the poorest temples in haven and one thing it could always use was willing hands not everyone who worked here in the service of thenoth was a priest or a novice plenty of ordinary people volunteered a few candlemarks in a week for the blessing of the god now what skif was hoping was that he could hide here for the sake of his labor he hoped he had a convincing enough story the door creaked open and a longnosed priest in a patched and dusty brown robe looked down at him lamp in one hand if you be seekin charity lad this bent the place for ye he said wearily but not unkindly ye should try the not charity sor skif said putting on his best country accent i be a norphan sor mine nuncle turn me out of the farum and i come here tcity alookin for horsework but i got no character i be good with horses sor an donkeys an belike but no mun gi me work withouten a character the priest opened the door a little wider and frowned thoughtfully a character ist would ye bide in yon loft tend the beasts and eat with the brethren for say six moon an we give ye a good letter skif bobbed his head eagerly yed gi me a good character then summut i can take fer twork fer stable hes taken it he thought with exultation if yeve earned it the priest opened the gate wide and skif stepped into the dusty courtyard come try your paces enter freely and walk in peace skif felt his fear slide off him and vanish no one would look for him here and even if they did no one would dare the wrath of a god to try and take him out so what if his story wasnt quite the truth i don mind a bituv hard work god cant take exception tthat the priest closed the gate behind them and led skif into and through the very simple temple out into another courtyard and across to a stabling area as he followed in the priests wake skif was struck forcibly by two things the first was the incredible poverty of this place the second was an aura of peace that descended on him the moment he crossed the threshold it was so powerful it seemed to smother every bad feeling he had suddenly he wasnt afraid at all not of the sellsword not of the bastard that had arranged for bazies building to burn somehow he knew he knew that nothing bad could come inside these walls somehow he knew that as long as he kept the peace here he would not ever have to fear the outside world coming in to get him that should have frightened him and it didnt but he didnt have any leisure to contemplate it either once they entered the stable skif had ample cause now to be grateful for the time hed spent living in that loft above the donkey stable where hed gotten acquainted with beast tending because it was quite clear that the order was badly shorthanded one poor old man was still tottering around by the light of several lamps feeding and watering the motley assortment of hoof stock in this stable skif didnt even hesitate for a moment this if ever was the moment to prove his concocted story and a real stableboy wouldnt have hesitated either he dropped his bedroll and belongings just inside the stable door and went straight for the buckets reckoning that water was going to be harder for the old fellow to carry than grain or hay and after all hed had more than his share of water carrying when hed been living with bazie the old man cast him a look of such gratitude that skif almost felt ashamed of the ruse he was running on these people except that it wasnt exactly a ruse he was going to do the work he just wasnt planning on sticking around for the next six moons and of course he was going to be doing some other things on the side that they would never know about as he watered each animal in its stall he took a cursory look at them for the most part the only thing wrong with them was that they were old not a bad thing since it meant that none of them possessed enough energy or initiative to try more than a halfhearted weary nip at him much less a kick poor old things he thought venturing to pat one ancient donkey who nuzzled him with something like tentative affection as he filled its watering trough and these were the lucky ones beasts whose owners felt they deserved an honorable retirement after years of endless labor the unlucky ones became stew and meat pies in the cookshops and taverns that served havens poor bless ye my son said the old priest gratefully as they passed one another we be perilous shorthanded for the hoof stock just in stable skif asked carefully keeping to his country accent the priest nodded patting a dusty rump as he moved to fill another manger with the wee beasts the hurt ones theres healer trainees that coom thelp an theres folks that dont mind turnin a hand with cleanin and feedin but this skif laughed softly aye granther this be work eh the old priest laughed himself struth they say theres a pair of novices coming up come winter but till then till then ill be takin the heavy work granther skif heard himself promise when the last of the beasts were watered and fed the old man showed him his place in the loft and left him with a lantern trudging back to the chapter house like his last bed above a stable this was in a gable end with a window supplied with storm shutters piled high with hay that looked out over the courtyard he spread out his bedroll stowed his few possessions in the rafters blew out the lantern and lay down to watch the moon rise over the roofs of haven thiss been about th strangest day of mlife he thought hands tucked behind his head what was just about the strangest part of it was that he had literally gone from a state of fearing for his very life to this there was such an aura of peace and serenity within these walls what might have seemed foolish trust under any other circumstances after all he was just some stranger whod shown up on their doorstep and at night yet was perfectly understandable now that skif could see the poverty of the place himself there literally was nothing to steal if he didnt do the work hed promised he wouldnt be fed and hed be turned out there was no reason for the brethren not to trust him he should have been feeling very smug and very clever hed found the perfect hiding place and it was well within striking distance of the manors of the high and mighty instead all he could think was that as workworn and weary as both the priests had seemed there had also been something about them that made his cleverness seem not quite as clever as hed thought it was as if they had seen through his ruse and didnt care and that didnt make any sense at all ive got to think this through he told himself fighting the soporific scent of cured hay the drowsy breathing of the animals in their stalls beneath him and the physical and emotional exhaustion of the last day and night it was a battle he was doomed to lose from the start before the moon rose more than a hands breadth above the houses he was as fast asleep as the animals below skif started awake both hands clutching hay as a mellow bell rang out directly above his head for a moment he was utterly confused he couldnt remember where he was much less why hed been awakened by a bell in the pitchdark then it all came back just as someone came across the courtyard bearing a lit lantern hellfires he thought a little crossly yet a little amused i shoulda known this lotd be up afore dawn mebbe i aint been so smart after all heyla laddie called the aged voice of last night from below be ye awake oh aye granther skif replied stifling a groan i be acoomin down he brought last nights lantern down with him and he and the old man made the morning rounds of the stable in an oddly companionable silence the old man didnt ask his name and didnt seem to care that skif didnt offer it what he did do was give skif the name and history of every old horse donkey mule and goat in the stable treating each of them like the old friend it probably was when they finished feeding and watering the old man led skif into the chapter house straight to a room where others of the order had stripped to the waist and were washing up not wanting to sit down to breakfast smelling of horse and goat skif was perfectly willing to follow their example from there they all went to breakfast which was also eaten in silence oat porridge bread butter and milk skif was not the only person who wasnt wearing the robes of the order but the other two secular helpers were almost as old as the priest who tended the stable there were younger priests but they all had some sort of deformity or injury that hadnt healed right one and all either through age or defect they seemed to be outcasts people for whom there was no comfortable niche in a family nor a place in the society of other humans maybe that was why they came here and devoted themselves to animals yet they all seemed remarkably content even happy after breakfast it was back to the stable where skif mucked out the stalls while the old priest groomed his charges even the goats were brushed until their coats shone as much as the coat of an aged goat could then it was time for the noon meal with more washingup first then the old man had him take the couple of horses that were still able to do a little work out to help carry a few loads about the compound he and his charges hauled firewood to the kitchen feed grains to bird coops rubbish out to be sorted muck to bins where muck collectors would come to buy it the place was larger than hed thought there were mews for aging or permanently injured hawks and falcons a loft for similarly injured doves and pigeons kennels for dogs a cattery a chicken yard that supplied the order with eggs a small dairy herd of goats and a place for injured wildlife it was here that skif caught sight of a couple of youngsters not much older than he wearing robes of a pale green and he realized with a start that these must be the healer trainees hed heard about it was quite literally the first time he had ever seen a healer of any rank or station and he couldnt help but gawp at them like the country bumpkin he was pretending to be then it was time for the evening meal all meals were very plain with the noon and evening meal consisting of bread eggs cheese and vegetables with the addition of soup at the noon meal and fruit at the dinner meal then came the same feeding and watering chores hed had last night and with a start he realized that the entire day had flowed past him like a tranquil stream and he hadnt given a single thought to anything outside the four walls of the order and realized with an even greater start that he didnt care or at least he hadnt up until that time and he felt a very different sort of fear then the place was changing him and unless he started to fight it there was a good chance that it wouldnt be long until no one recognized him and possibly even more frightening he had to wonder how long it would be before he wouldnt even recognize himself skif decided that no matter how tired he was he was not going to put off the start of his vendetta any longer and he wasnt going to let the deep peace of this place wash away his anger either when he finished watering the animals for the night and the old priest tottered back to the chapter house he blew out his lantern but perched himself in the loft window to keep an eye on the rest of the priory one by one lights winked out across the courtyard skif set his jaw as a drowsy peace settled over the scene and hovered heavily all around him he knew what it was now this was the peace of the god and it kept everyone who set foot here happy and contented granted that wasnt bad for those who lived here there were no fights among the animals and there was accord among those who cared for them but this peace was a trap for skif it would be all too easy to be lulled by it until he forgot the need for revenge forgot what he was he didnt want to forget what he was and he didnt want to become what this place wanted him to be when the last light winked out he waited a little longer marking the time by how far above the horizon a single bright star rose and when he figured that everyone would surely be asleep he moved for someone like skif there was no challenge in getting over the walls silently as any shadow he knew where to go first too if he could not strike at his foe directly he could at least strike at someone who was near to his real target serve the rich bastard right for trusting someone who would murder innocent people just because they were in his way besides all those rich bastards were alike even if this one hadnt actually murdered poor folks he probably wouldnt care that his friend had and my lord rovenar was oh so conveniently away on his family estate in the country lord rovenars roof was fashionably paved in slate it was with great glee that skif proceeded to riddle the entire roof with cracks and gaps the next time it rained the roof would leak like a sieve there was also a cistern up here a modern convenience that permitted my lord and his family to enjoy the benefits of running water throughout the mansion skif hastened the ruin of the upper reaches of the building by piercing the pipes leading downward creating a slow leak that would empty the cistern directly into the attics and from there into the rest of the house besides rainwater the cistern could be filled by pumping water up from the mansions own well but by the time skif was finished any water pumped up would only drain into the attics with the rest of it so much for vandalism on the exterior skif worked his way over to an attic window which wasnt locked after all the servants never expected anyone to be up on the roof and cer tainly wouldnt expect that anyone who did get up on the roof would dangle himself over the edge push open the shutters with his feet and let himself inside his night had only just begun when he let himself out again this time from a cellar window his pockets were full of small valuable objects and the trail of ruin had continued though most of it would take days and weeks before it was discovered skif had left food in beds to attract insects and mice and had ensured that those pests would invade by laying further trails of diluted honey and crumbs all over the house around the baseboards where it was unlikely that the maids slacking work in the masters absence would notice he left windows cracked open left shutters ajar insects would soon be in the rooms and starlings and pigeons colonizing the attic the skeleton staff that had been left here would not discover any of this for his depredations took place in rooms that had been closed up the furnishings swathed in sheets my lord would return to a house in shambles and it would take a great deal of money and effort to make it livable again he ghosted his way across the kitchen garden and over the wall using a trellis as a ladder but once on the other side he laid a trail of a different sort all of those valuable trinkets hed filled his pockets with he scattered them in his wake and trusted to greed to see to it that they never found their way back to their true owner again he took nothing for himself if for no other reason than that it would prevent anyone from connecting him with the trail of damage he slipped easily back over the temple walls and got into his bed in the loft in plenty of time for a nap when the bell sounded and woke him if he wasnt fully rested at least he didnt look so exhausted that anyone commented on it although the meals hed shared with the brethren yesterday had been shared in silence evidently there was no actual rule of silence for the noon meal brought a flurry of gossip from the outside world the master thief struck again last night said one of the younger priests to the rest of the table the streets are full of talk and he must be from somewhere outside haven so they say added another with a shake of his head singularly careless he was he left a trail of dropped objects behind him i heard i can vouch that there are so many people scouring the alleys for bits of treasure that some of the highborn have asked the guard to drive them back to the slums i hope said the prior with great dignity that the guard declined the alleys are public thoroughfares they do not belong to the highborn neither is the guard answerable to those with noble titles who are discomfited by the poor outside their walls there cannot be any justification for such a request since there are still treasure hunters looking in every nook and cranny i suspect they did decline the young priest said cheerfully he seemed highly amused and skif wondered why the prior shook his head sadly i know that you have little sympathy when rich men are despoiled of their goods brother halcom if the gods choose the hand of a thief to chastise those who are themselves thieves i find it ironic but appropriate sir brother halcom replied evenly this master thief has so far robbed two men who have greatly oppressed others you know this to be true nevertheless the thief himself commits a moral error and incurs harm to his soul with his actions the prior chided him gently you should spend less time gloating over the misfortune of the mighty and more in praying that this miscreant realizes his errors and repents brother halcom made a wry face but the prior didnt see it skif did however and he noted when the young priest rose from the table that his leg ended in a dreadful club foot the priest had spoken in the accents of someone who was highly educated and skif had to wonder how much brother halcom knew personally about the two who had officially been robbed and whether he knew anything about the one that skif had despoiled for one moment he wondered if the young man had really meant what he said hed sounded sympathetic fah hell have no time fer the likes of me no doubt he thought hardening his heart well look whos stuck muckin out the stalls an whos playin with the brokewinged birds push comes t shove money an rank stands together gainst the rest of us what always does the dirty work anyroad he finished his meal and went back out to clean kennels with the master thief out last night and everybody and his dog hunting for the goodies that skif had let fall the last thing skif was going to do was to go out again tonight no things would have to cool down a bit before he ran the rooftops again it gave him a great deal of pleasure though to lie back in the sweetsmelling hay and contemplate last nights work the only thing that spoiled his pleasure was the thought that this unknown master thief was going to get all of the credit for his work on the other hand it would probably anger the master thief to be saddled with the eventual blame for all of the vandalizing skif had done and at the moment no one would be looking for a mere boy theyd be trying to catch a man this master thief was proving rather useful to skifs campaign i spose i oughta be grateful to im skif thought but he didnt feel grateful in fact after a while he realized that he wasnt as satisfied with last nights work as he thought he should be it just wasnt enough somehow he was thrashing around at random blindly trying to hit the one he truly wanted to hurt and hoping that somehow in the chaos hed connect with a blow and even then how did putting holes in someones roof measure up to burning down a building and committing coldblooded murder in the process it didnt and that was that i want him skif thought angrily i want the bastard what ordered it nothing more but nothing less and right now he was settling for less still that brother halcom had a point too hed seemed to think that the two highborn nobles that had been robbed had pretty much deserved it and probably lord rovenar had done a dirty deed or two in his life and skif had been nothing more than the instrument of payback that wasnt a bad thought brother halcom knew the highborn brother halcom might know enough to give skif a clue or two to the identity of the one highborn that skif really wanted so maybe skif ought to see if he could get brother halcom to talk finding someone to hurt that he knew deserved it might feel better than this random lashing out and maybe just maybe brother halcom would know who the smoothvoiced highborn was skif watched brother halcom from a distance for a full week before making a tentative approach he learned two things in that time brother halcom was from a highborn family and he was here because he wanted to be not that his family hadnt tried to get their deformed offspring out of sight but theyd chosen a much more comfortable and secluded temple for him to enter halcom had stood up to them and threatened to make a scene if he wasnt allowed his choice that gave skif a bit more respect for the man and halcoms value rose again in his eyes when he realized that halcom didnt shirk the dirty work after all he just did the small things rather than the large he did his share of cleaning usually cleaning up after the healer trainees when theyd finished treating a sick or injured animal when there was a beast that needed to be tended all night it was halcom like as not who stood the vigil and when an animal was dying it was halcom who stayed with it comforting it as best he could finally skif found a moment to make a cautious overture to the young priest halcom had hobbled out to the stable to assist not a healer trainee but a farrier who often donated his time and expertise and skif was also called on to help the injury was a split and overgrown hoof on a lamed carthorse halcom was asked to hold the horses head since he more than anyone else was able to keep animals calm during treatment and skif was there to hold the hoof while the farrier trimmed it and fastened a special shoe to help the hoof heal when the farrier had left and skif had taken the horse back to its stall halcom seemed disinclined to leave youve been doing good work here friend halcom said looking around at the rest of the stable without getting up from the hay bale he was sitting on im glad you came here poor old brother absel just isnt up to the heavy work anymore thankee sor skif said keeping to his persona of country bumpkin and bobbing his head subserviently would ye might be agivin me a character too that be whatm here for i could probably do better than that if what you want is stable work halcom admitted but with a raised eyebrow ive no doubt i could recommend you to several people for that is that what you want oh aye sor skif replied feigning eagerness balderdash halcom countered startling skif youre better than that you dont really want to be a lowly stable hand for the rest of your life do you his eyes gleamed with speculation you are much too intelligent for that what are you aiming at master of horse chief coachman ah skif stammered before he got his wits together but ive got no training sor dunno much but burthen beasts and never learnt to drive halcom waved that aside as of no consequence nor have most boys your age when they go into service as small as you are though learning to handle the reins could be problematic im not sure you could control a team i be stronger nor i look sor skif said stung halcom laughed but it didnt have that sly mean sound to it that skif had half expected oh youd make a fine smart little footman sitting up beside your master on a fashionable chariot but ill tell you the truth lad there is not a single highborn or man of means and fashion that id feel comfortable sending you to in that capacity the good men have all the loyal footmen they need and the others he shook his head i wont send you to a bad master ye might tell me who they be sor skif offered tentatively if i didna know it i might take a place i was offered so you can avoid them halcom nodded thoughtfully thats no bad idea clever of you to think of it and he proceeded with forthright candor to outline the character of every man he thought skif ought not to take service with he was so candid that skif was frankly shocked not at the litany of faults and even vices his upbringing in the worst part of haven had exposed him to far worse than halcom revealed no it was that halcom was not at all reticent about unrolling the listing of faults of his own kind as halcom spoke skif found himself at war within himself he wanted to trust halcom and he had sworn never to trust anyone more than that he wanted to like halcom it seemed to him that halcom could easily become a friend and he did not want any more friends that leaves plenty of good masters to take service with mind halcom pointed out when he was finished and smiled and for all my differences with my own family i can quite cheerfully recommend you to take service with them theyre quite good to those who serve them well huh its only their own fleshnblood that they muck about with eh skif thought guess younme have more in common than i thought it was your own uncle that turned you out wasnt it halcom said suddenly startling skif again with his knowledge of skifs background halcom laughed at his expression wryly i suppose we have more in common than either of us would have suspected twas your nuncle sent ye off skif ventured halcom nodded and his face shadowed my existence was an embarrassment he admitted sourly my uncle feared that my presence in his household would cast a shadow over some pending betrothal arrangements he was negotiating my father his younger brother has no backbone to speak of and agreed that i ought to be persuaded to a vocation what skif asked indignantly they figger youd scare the bride my uncle suggested that the prospective brides father might rethink his offer if he thought that deformity ran in my family halcom said bluntly his mouth twisting in a frown since my parents are dependent on his generosity for a place i suppose i cant blame them he sighed deeply and his expression lightened in the end really im rather glad it happened i had very little to do with myself im really not much of a scholar and well needless to say im not cut out for court life either ive always loved animals and neither they nor my fellow brothers care about this wretched leg of mine and i did manage to shame my uncle into making a generous donation when he dumped me here skif nodded his head concealing as best he could that he was racked by an internal struggle he really truly wanted to be halcoms friend and he really truly did not want to make another friend that he knew he would only lose i aint stayin here forever he told himself sternly he wouldn be so nice if he knew what i was hellfires hed turn me straight over to th watch if he knew what i was but he could almost hear the place whispering to him it wanted him to stay he could have a friend again no one here would care what he had been only what he was now and what he might become oh hed never be rich but hed never starve either he steeled himself against the seductive whispers of peace him bide in a place like this not when he had a debt to repay not when there was someone out there that was so ruthless he would do anything to anyone who stood in his way besides this place would put him to sleep in a season hed turn into a sheep inside of a year and if there was one thing that skif had no desire to become it was a sheep well i imagine youve heard more than enough to send you to sleep about me halcom said hauling himself to his feet again and i still have my charges to attend to i wont keep you from your own duties any more lad but do remember what ive told you and that if you want a second letter of commendation to go with the priors when you leave i will be happy to write one for you that last said as halcom turned to go had the sound of a formal dismissal superior to inferior there you see he taunted that seductive whisper i aint a friend to the likes of a highborn even if his people did cast im off a mouse mights well ask a hawk tbe his friend hawk even say yes till he got hungry another week passed and the city was struck with a heat wave that was so oppressive people and animals actually began dying the queen closed the court and sent everyone but her privy council out of the city but there was nowhere for the poor and the working classes to go and even if there had been how could ordinary people just pack up and leave how would they make a living pay their bills feed their children life in haven went on as best it could as many folk as could changed their hours rising before dawn working until the heat grew intolerable enduring as best they could until late afternoon then taking up their tasks again in the evening the prior knew a clever trick or two though and the brethren began going through the poorer neighborhoods teaching people what the prior had taught them for although it was the lord of the beasts that the brethren served nevertheless man was brother to the beasts watersoaked pads of straw in windows somehow cooled the air that blew through them so long as there was a breeze and if there wasnt the cheapest more porous terracotta jars filled with water and placed about a room also helped to cool the air as the water evaporated from them stretching a piece of heavy paper over a frame then fastening that frame by one side to the ceiling and attaching a cord to a corner created a huge fan that would create a breeze when the winds themselves didnt oblige there were always children to pull the cord and they didnt mind doing so when the breeze cooled them as well and the same cheap terra cotta that was used for those jars could be made into tiles to be soaked with water and laid on the floor also cooling a room or the overheated person who lay down on them it helped all of it helped people were encouraged to sleep on flat rooftops or in their gardens or even in parks by night and in cellars by day but there was always someone greedy enough to want to make a profit from the misfortune of others suddenly the dank and dark basement rooms that had been the cheapest to rent became the most expensive not all landlords raised the rents on their cellars but many did and if it hadnt been so stiflingly hot there might have been altercations over it but it was just too hot no one could seem to get the energy even to protest skif was terribly frustrated it was nearly impossible to move around the city by night without being seen and yet with all of the wealthy and highborn gone it should have been childs play to continue his vendetta why the huge manors and mansions were so deserted that the master thief must have been looting them with impunity knowing that no one would discover his depredations until the heat wave broke and people returned to haven hellfires skif thought grumblingly as he returned from an errand to the market through streets that the noon heat had left deserted itd be easier to make a run by day than by then it hit him of course why not make his raids by day he was supposed to be resting like everyone and everything during the heat of the day no one would miss him at the priory and there would be no one around to see him in the deserted mansions not with the skeleton staffs spending their time in the cool of the wine cellars most of them asleep if they had any sense thats prolly what the master thiefs doing he thought with glee he was delighted to have thought of it and enjoyed a moment of mental preening over his own cleverness well he certainly would not be wearing his black sneak suit for these jobs his best bet was to look perfectly ordinary the fact was he probably wouldnt even need to get in via the rooftops the doors and windows would all be unlocked after all who would ever expect a thief to walk in the kitchen door in broad daylight he brought the bag of flour and the basket of other sundries hed been sent for to the kitchen and left it on the table the brother who acted as cook had changed the routine because of the heat a great many things were being served cold boiled eggs cheese vegetables and so forth actual cooking was done at night and in ovens and on brick stoves erected in the kitchen courtyard the biggest meal of the day was now breakfast the noon meal was no longer a meal but consisted of whatever anyone was able to eat given the heat which killed appetites picked up as one got hungry in the kitchen big bowls of cleaned sliced vegetables submerged in water lined the counters loaves of bread resided under cheesecloth boiled eggs in a smaller bowl beside them there was butter and cheese in the cold larder if anyone wanted it which hardly anyone did skif helped himself to carrot strips and celery and a piece of bread he ate the bread plain because he couldnt bear the thought of butter either the place might just as well have been deserted the only sign that there had been anyone in the kitchen was the lumps of bread dough left to rise under cloths along their shelf skif wasnt all that hungry either but he ate and drank deeply of the cooled water from yet another terracotta jar then he went straight back out as if he had been sent on a second errand not that there was anyone about to notice he sauntered along the streets watching the heat haze hovering above the pavement keeping to the shade and noting that there still were a few folk out they paid no attention to him and he gave them no more than a cursory glance there was not so much as a hint of the watch no surprise there what was there for them to do there would be no fights and it was too hot for petty theft even if there was anything open at noon to steal from where to hit that was the question he had no clear target in mind and he wasnt as familiar with who belonged to which great mansion as he would have liked finally he decided for lack of any other ideas to bestow his attentions on one thomlan vel cerican a charming fellow who had amassed a great deal of wealth by squeezing his poor tenants and giving them as little in the way of decent housing as he could get away with he was one of the landlords who had responded to the current heat wave by evicting tenants from the newlydesirable basement rooms and charging a premium rate for them sending the evicted to live in the attics it seemed as good a reason as any to wreak as much havoc as humanly possible on him if he hadnt burned his own buildings to avoid having to make repairs it was only because he had balked at actually destroying anything he owned so skifs steps took him in the direction of the great homes of those who aspired to be counted among the highborn not those who had actually gotten to that position there was still no sign of watch guards or anyone else he strolled along the street not the alley and nothing met his interested gaze but shuttered and curtained windows behind the gates these houses while imposing did not boast the grounds and gardens of those of the true nobility land was at a premium within the second set of city walls there were three sets of walls in fact four if you counted the ones surrounding the palace and the three collegia each time that the city of haven had outgrown its walls a new set had been built when that happened land within the previous walls became highly desirable now between the first set and the palace walls only the highborn those with old titles had their mansions and indeed manors which had enormous gardens and landscaped grounds between the second and first those who had newer titles most less than a generation old and the wealthy but not ennobled kept their state lesser dwellings had been bought up and razed to make way for these newer mansions there were gardens but they were a fraction of the size of those of the great lords of state but there were parks here places where one could ride or stroll and be observed between the third walls and the second lived most of the rest of the city although the populace had already begun to spill outside the walls and many of those whose wealth was very recent had taken to building mansions that aped those of the great lords of state but outside the walls altogether where land was cheaper eventually skif supposed another set of walls would be built and then it would be his neighborhood that would be razed to make way for the mansions of the wealthy skif passed one of the parks and decided to take a rest near a lilycovered pond it was deserted the air shimmering with heat above the scorched lawns between the trees his target was on the other side of this park and it occurred to him that it wouldnt be a bad idea to observe it from the comfort of the park while he cooled off a little even though he had sauntered along in slothful fashion he was still sweating he pulled his linen shirt away from his body and threw himself down in the shade of a huge oak tree beside the pond the ground was marginally cooler than the air or his body but there were no signs that anyone was actually sleeping here at night despite the suggestions of the authorities skif wasnt surprised the watch probably was discouraging the poor from moving into the parks in this section of the city even though there were more of them here than between the second and third walls the watch was answerable directly to the wealthy folk living here as opposed to the guard which was answerable to the crown even though they were not here to witness the poor camping out of a night in their park not one of the moneyed lot who lived around here even wanted to consider the prospect the local watch probably had orders to clear out campers as fast as they arrived skif turned his head to peer between bushes nearby thinking he heard something some zealous watchman perhaps if so hed better be prepared with a story about why he was here he had heard something but it wasnt a member of the watch there was a horse wandering loose around the park taking nibbles out of the grass sampling the flowers it was a handsome creature white as snow and still wore a saddle and bridle reins dangled from the bridle no it was a bitless hackamore he saw no one would leave reins dangling like that your horse could all too easily catch a leg in them stumble fall and perhaps break a leg but if you didnt tie the reins off properly when you left a horse waiting the horse could jerk them loose and wander off leaving them dangling just like these were for one wild moment skif thought is that a companion but no if it had been a companion there would certainly be a herald somewhere about and besides the saddle and hackamore were old very plain wellworn everyone knew that companions went about in elaborate blueandsilver tack with silver bridle bells and embroidered barding there were plenty of white horses around that werent companions it was something of an affectation in some fashionable sets to ride white horses or have a carriage drawn by matched teams of them no some idiot hadnt tied his horse properly or far more likely given the worn state of the tack some groom had taken his masters mare out for some exercise and had combined the chore with some errand of his own he hadnt tied the horse up and shed pulled her reins loose and wandered away that groom would be in a lot of trouble but since there wasnt anyone combing the park looking for this beast evidently he hadnt missed her yet well his loss was skifs gain working at the priory had given him a lot more familiarity with horses than hed had before hed even learned to ride and faced with this opportunity for profit on four legs he grinned broadly youre mine he told the grazing mare lessee horse fairs runnin over on the east side or i kin take her out of the walls altogether an sell her or i kin take her tpriory an collect th reward when she shows up missin the last option wasnt a bad notion though the first was the real money maker the horse moved around the bushes and out of his sight knowing that she was probably some highstrung wellbred beast he got up slowly and began to stalk her if he a stranger was going to catch her rather than spooking her hed have to catch her by surprise when she actually moved between two thick untrimmed hedges he could hardly believe his good luck she couldnt have gotten into a better situation for him to corner her knowing that a horse is averse to backing up he ran around to the front of the hedges and struck making a dash out of cover he grabbed for the reins and the saddle in the same movement hauling himself into the saddle before she had time to do more than snort and somehow before he realized it he was in the saddle and in control for just about a heartbeat because in the next moment the horse tossed her head jerking the reins out of his hand and set off at a gallop and all he could do was cling desperately to the pommel of the saddle all skif could do was hold on with every aching finger with knees and thighs wrists and ankles if he could have held on with his teeth he would have if he could have tied his hair to the saddle he would have hed lost the stirrups almost at once shortly after he lost the reins that didnt give him a lot of options either cling on like a burr or try to jump off but the mare was going so fast he knew if he jumped hed get hurt badly badly hurt and that was if he was lucky hed seen someone whod been thrown from a galloping horse once the poor fool had his back broken healers could fix that hed been told if the healer got to you quickly enough if you were important enough to see a healer hed seen countless people thrown from runaway wagons and they always ended up with broken arms and legs that was bad enough she was at the gallop head down charging along as if shed gone mad pounding down the paved streets the occasional bystander gawking at them as they tore past no one tried to stop the runaway horse and all that skif could do was hang on tight and trust to the fact that as hot as it was shed tire soon shed have to tire soon she was only a horse just a fancy horse she couldnt run forever he closed his eyes and crouched over the saddle gripping her with his thighs and holding onto the pommel of the saddle with all his might her mane whipped at his face it was like being beaten with a fly whisk and he gasped with every driving blow of her hooves that drove the pommel into his gut shed be slowing any moment now any moment now oh please he cracked his eye open and closed it again she wasnt slowing if anything she was running faster people shops pavement blurred past so fast he was getting sick his eyes watered as some of her mane lashed across them how was that possible hellftres i stole a racehorse of all the stupid idiot things to have done he opened his eyes again just in time to see a wagon pull across the street in front of them and stop shes got to stop now she raised her head a little and her ears cocked forward shes not gonna stop the driver stared at them then abruptly dove off the seat the mare increased her pace he felt her muscles bunch up under his legs shes gonna jump it she shoved off her forequarters rising he clawed desperately at the saddle as his weight shifted backward he screamed in terror knowing he was going to fall then the wagonbed was underneath him she landed he was flung forward his nose and right eye slamming into her neck he saw stars and his head exploded with pain somehow some way he managed to hang on the thought of falling off terrified him more than staying on she didnt even break stride as she continued her run and careened around a corner sweat flew off her and she didnt even seem to notice she was off around another corner pounding through a halfempty market then toward the last of the city walls no but she wasnt listening to what he wanted she plunged into the tunnel beneath the walls and for a moment her hooves echoed in the darkness sounding like an entire herd of horses was in here with him there were guards on the wall surely surely they would stop her then she was out with no sign of a guardsman skif dared another glance out of the eye that wasnt swelling through his tears all he could see was a road stretching ahead of them the road leading away from haven he couldnt even tell which road all he knew for certain was that they were flying down a roadway and people were scattering out of their way shouting curses after them the mare wove her way in and out of the traffic with the agility of a dancer he actually felt the touch on his ankle as they brushed by other riders the whiplike cut of a horses tail as it shied out of the way and somehow she was getting faster he knew if he tried to throw himself off now hed die it was just that simple no one not even an experienced rider could slip off a horse at speeds like this and live he wouldnt just break bones hed break his neck or his skull and die instantly all he could do was what he had been doing hang on try not to get thrown and hope that when she stopped hed be able to get off of her without her killing him he gritted his teeth together hissing with the pain of his eye and nose so full of fear there was no room in his head for anything else the sounds of shouting and cursing were gone he dared another glance there were no more buildings beside the road now nothing but fields with tiny farmhouses off in the distance the road still had plenty of traffic though and the mare wove her way in and out of it with a nonchalance that made the hair on the back of his head stand up people werent shouting and cursing at them because they were too busy trying to get out of the way he had never been so terrified in his entire life he squeezed his eyes tight shut again and for the first time in his life began to pray skif was limp with exhaustion dripping with sweat and aching so much that he wasnt sure he even cared what happened to him now he also had no idea where he was the mare had gotten off the main road and was still running though not at the headlong pace shed held through the city this was a normal gallop if anything this mare did was normal this was a country road rutted dirt with trees on both sides that met over his head forming a tunnel of green if his eye and nose hadnt hurt so much and if he hadnt been so terrified hed never been anywhere like this before in his life he had no idea how far they were from haven a long way that was about all he could tell so in addition to the rest of it he was hopelessly lost and completely outside familiar territory and the sun was setting he wanted to cry he did cry tears leaking silently out from the corners of his eyes his nose felt as if it was the size of a cabbage and it throbbed the mare suddenly changed direction again darting into a mere break in the trees down a path so seldom used that there werent even any cart tracks in it she slowed again to a trot now he could hear what was going on around him birds the wind in the trees the dull thud of the mares hooves on the turf so this was what people meant by peaceful countryside well they could have it hed have given an arm for his loft room right now he could probably have gotten off her back at this point but for what he didnt even know where he was here they were in the middle of a complete wilderness with no shelter nothing to eat and no people so where would he go somehow he had to convince this devil beast to get him back home now she slowed to a walk and all he could do was slump over her neck as the light coming through the trees took on an amber cast she was sweating but no more than one of the horses he was familiar would have been after a moderately hard job she should have been foaming with sweat foaming she should be collapsed on the ground by now head bobbing with each step she ambled down the path and then with no more warning than when shed started this run she stopped skif looked up through eyes blurring with exhaustion and tears of frustration and fear now what they stood in a tiny clearing in front of the smallest building he had ever seen they were completely surrounded by trees and the only other object in the clearing was a pump i next to the building with a big stone trough beneath it he couldnt hear anything but birds and the wind if there were any humans anywhere around there was no sign of them for i the first time in his life skif was completely alone hed have given anything to see a single human being even a watchman if the watch had showed up hed have flung himself into their arms and begged them to take him to gaol every muscle every bone every inch of skifs body was in pain his nose and eye hurt worst but everything hurt he sat in the saddle blinking his bad eye watering and choked back a sob then he slowly pried his fingers one at a time away from the pommel of the saddle he looked down at the ground which seemed furlongs away and realized that he couldnt dismount it wasnt that he didnt want to it was that he couldnt he couldnt make his cramped legs move and even if he could he was afraid to fall then the mare solved his problem by abruptly shying sideways he didnt so much slide off the saddle as it was that the horse and her saddle slid out from underneath him he made a grab for the pommel again but it was too late he tumbled to the ground and just barely managed to catch himself so that he landed on his rump instead of his face in a huge pile of drifted leaves it hurt not as badly as say hitting hard pavement would have but it still hurt and it knocked what was left of his breath out of him for a moment and made him see stars again when his eyes cleared he looked around he sat in the middle of the pile of old damp leaves dazed and bewildered at finding himself on the ground again ow he said after a moment of consideration the mare turned stepping lightly and carefully and shoved him with her nose in the middle of his chest he shoved back finally roused to some sensation other than confusion you get away from me you he said angrily f it wasnt for you i she shoved at him again and without meaning to he looked straight into her eyes they were blue and deep as the sky and he fell into them hello skif he heard from somewhere far far away my name is cymry and i choose you and he dropped into a place where he would never be alone or friendless again when he came back to himself the first thing he did was stagger to his feet and back away from the companion never mind the wonderful dream hed been in it was a dream it couldnt be real something was terribly wrong his companion cymry looked at him and he felt her amusement his companion and that was just not possible are you outa your mind he croaked staring at her no she said and shook her head i choose you youre a herald well you will be after you go through the collegium and get your whites right now youre just a trainee like hell he retorted feelingly you are crazy or i am it occurred to him then that all this might just be some horrible dream maybe when hed jumped onto the horse it had thrown him and he was lying on his back in that park knocked out cold and hallucinating maybe he hadnt even seen the horse the heat had knocked him over and he was raving none of this was happening that must be it dont be stupid cymry replied shoving at him with her nose be sensible do you ever have black eyes and a broken nose in a dream its not a dream youre not unconscious and are chosen and youre going to be a herald i dont bloody well think so he said trying to back further away from her and coming up against the wall of the little building if you think i am youre crazy don you know what i am how could this be happening he didnt want to be a herald oh even bazie had spoken about them with admiration but no heralds were ever plucked out of a gutter not even in a tale of course i do she replied calmly youre a thief a rather good one for your age too well then i cant be a herald can i he groped for words to try and convince her how mad how impossible this was even though deep inside something cried out that he didnt want it to be impossible heralds are well theyre all noble an highborn she snorted with amusement at his ignorance no they arent not more than a quarter of them at most anyway heralds are just ordinary people farmers craftsmen fisherfolk ordinary people well theyre heroes and none of them started out that way she countered most of them started out as ordinary younglings being chosen by a companion there wasnt anything special about them until then not visibly anyway theyre good she considered that for a moment head to one side that rather depends on your definition of good actually granted they are supposed to uphold the law she continued thoughtfully but in the course of their duties plenty of them break the law as much as they uphold it if you want to be technical about it but but he spluttered as the last light pierced through the tree trunks and turned everything a rosy red including cymry but heralds are they do heralds are what they have to be they do what the queen and the country need cymry said supremely calm and confident we choose those who are best suited to do those things and supply those needs and what makes you think that the queen and country might not need the skills of a thief well there was just no possible answer to that and even though his mouth opened and closed several times he couldnt make any sounds come out of it she paced close to him and once again he was caught though not nearly so deeply in those sparkling sapphire eyes now look im tired and hungry and sweaty so are you but they were in the middle of nowhere where was he how was he this is a way station and as a herald trainee dont argue youre entitled to anything in it she whickered softly promise theres food and bedding and just about anything you might need in there theres also a bucket of water inside to prime the pump with i suggest that before it gets too horribly dark you pump up some water clean both of us up and get us both some of the food thats waiting you are hungry arent you you can eat and rest here for the night and we can talk about all of this she cocked both of her ears at him and added and while youre at it it wouldnt hurt to make a poultice for that black eye youre getting its becoming rather spectacular herald alberich weaponsmaster to heralds collegium and sometime intelligence agent for queen selenay put down the brush hed been using on kantors mane and stared at his companion in complete and utter shock companions didnt lie but what kantor had just told him was impossible you must be joking he said aloud in his native tongue kantor turned his head to look at his chosen as you well know he said with mock solemnity i have no sense of humor in a pigs eye alberich muttered thinking of all of the tricks his companion had authored over the years including the one of smuggling himself past the karsite border to choose and abduct one captain alberich of the karsite army but i assure you i am not joking cymry has managed to choose that young scamp youve caught eavesdropping on you over the past couple of months he is a thief and shell probably be delivering him to the collegium some time tomorrow so i suggest you prepare your fellow heralds he promises to make things interesting around here kantor arched his neck but before you do that you might take that brush along my crest it still itches what in the name of vkandis sunlord are we supposed to do with a thief alberich demanded not obliging kantor with the brush what you always do with the newly chosen youll train him of course kantor turned his head again and regarded his chosen with a very blue eye hasnt it occurred to you that a skilled thief would be extremely useful in the current situation that you and the queen have found yourselves in scratch a thief youll find a spy set a thief to take a thief and you have been losing state secrets well of course it has all you have to do is appeal to the lads better instincts and bring them to the fore i assure you he has plenty of better instincts after all hes been chosen and we dont make mistakes about the characters of those we choose do we kantor didnt have any eyebrows to arch but the sidelong look he bestowed on alberich was certainly very similar well so there you are about that brush in your hand belatedly alberich brought the brush up and began vigorously using it along kantors crest the companion sighed in blissful pleasure and closed his eyes and alberich began to consider just how he was going to break the news about this newest trainee to dean elcarth and the rest assuming of course they werent already having similar conversations with their companions it was a good thing that bazie had taught him how to cook yes there was food here but it wasnt the sort of thing the ordinary citybred boy would have recognized as such id have told you what to do cymry said her head sticking in the door watching him as he baked currantfilled oatcakes on a stone on the hearth hed also put together a nice bean soup from the dried beans and spices hed found but he didnt think it would be done any time soon and he was hungry now i wouldnt let you starve im perfectly capable of telling you how to use just about anything in this way station somehow i aint sprised he replied turning the cakes deftly once one side was brown is there anything ye cant do im a bit handicapped by the lack of hands she admitted cheerfully she and he were both much cleaner at this point beside the pump there had been a generous trough easily filled and easily emptied after shed drunk her fill and he had washed and brushed her down as she asked hed had a bath in it then he emptied it out and refilled it for her drinking the cold bath had felt wonderful it was the first time in a week that hed been able to cool down hed also washed up his clothing it was hanging on a bush just outside it was a lot more comfortable to sit around in his singlet since there wasnt anyone but cymry to see him anyway shed told him which herbs to make into a poultice that did a lot to ease the ache of his eye and nose and more to make into a tea that did something about his throbbing head she already knew evidently that he could cook and had left him alone while he readied his dinner over the tiny hearth in the way station now he couldnt imagine why he hadnt figured out she was a companion immediately unless it was just that the idea of a companion wandering around in an old worn set of tack was so preposterous and the idea of a companion deciding to make a herald out of a thief was still more so i told them to tack me up in the oldest kit in the stables that would fit me she offered as he scooped the oatcakes off their stone and juggled one from hand to hand waiting for it to cool enough to eat he gave her a curious stare ye ye kidnapped me he accused well would you have come with me if id walked up to you and chosen you she asked her head cocked to one side i am sorry about your nose but that was an accident but ive known for several weeks that you were my chosen she said as if it was so matteroffact that he shouldnt even be considering any other possibility ive just been waiting for the opportunity to get you alone where i could explain things to you but youve already lost this argument you know she pointed out three times infact he gave up besides the cake was cool enough to eat and he was hungry enough by this point to eat the oats raw much less in the cakes hed just made he put a second poultice on his eye and nose and lay back in the boxbed that filled most of the way station it had a thick layer of fresh hay in it covered over with a coarse canvas sheet it was just as comfortable as his bed in the priory and although he wasnt sleepy yet he didnt really want to venture out into the alien environment outside his door he heard things out there all manner of unfamiliar sounds enlivened the darkness and he didnt much care for them there were wild animals out there owls and bats and who knew what else there could be bears you dont for one moment think that i would let anything hurt you do you the unexpected fierceness of that question made him open his good eye and turn his head to look at her where she lay halfin halfout of the doorway i don know anything bout you he admitted slowly nothin at all bout companions well i wouldnt she sighed and youre about to learn a great deal about companions no i aint theyre gonna take one look at me an throw me out he replied stubbornly no they arent they already know who you are what you are and that im bringing you in tomorrow what he yelped sitting up straight keeping the poultice clapped to his eye with one hand well not everybody just the people who need to the dean of the collegium thats the herald whos in charge of the whole of heralds collegium herald alberich the weaponsmaster the queens own and the queen a couple of the other teachers they all know and they arent going to throw you out she was so matteroffact about it as if it shouldnt even occur to him to doubt her as to how they know i told them of course actually i told them through their companions but it amounts to the same thing he flopped back down in the bed head spinning this was all going much too fast for him much much too fast now what am i gonna do he moaned mostly to himself i cant ever go back th watchd hev me afore i took a step you couldnt go back anyway cymry replied but skif do you really really want me to leave you the voice in his mind was no more than a whisper but it was a whisper that woke the echoes of that unforgettable moment when he felt an empty place inside him fill with something he had wanted for so long so very very long no he whispered back and to his profound embarrassment felt his throat swelling with a sob at the very thought i didnt think so because i couldnt bear to lose you her thoughts took on a firmer tone and i wont no one tries to separate a companion and her chosen that would be unthinkable he lay in the firelit darkness for a long time listening to the strange night sounds in the woods outside the beating of his own heart and his own thoughts then he sighed heavily i guess i gotta be a herald he said reluctantly but i still think theres gonna be trouble then well face it together because i am never ever going to let anyone separate us in the morning gingerly probing of his nose and the area around his eye and the fact that he could actually open that eye again proved that the poultice had done its work he cleaned himself up in the cold water and donned his shirt and trews wrinkled and a little damp but theyd have to do they both ate he cleaned the things hed used and shut the way station up again hed been stiff and sore when he woke up but he knew from experience that only moving around would make that kind of soreness go away besides at the moment he couldnt wait to get back to the city where he belonged whatever people saw in the country was invisible to him the silence alone would drive him crazy in a day there was just one problem of course and that was that he wasnt going home he was going to this collegium place as he mounted cymrys wellworn saddle with a great deal more decorum this time he shook his head slightly i still think theres gonna be trouble he predicted glumly skif there will always be trouble where you are she replied mischievously well just have to try to keep it from getting out of hand without a backward glance she started up the forest trail going in a few paces from a walk to a trot to an easy lope it was very strange riding her now that he knew what she was for one thing she wasnt a horse he didnt have control over her and that was the way it was supposed to be not an accident but as they moved out of the woods and onto roads that had a bit of morning traffic he began to notice something else now that they werent charging down the road in a manner threatening to life and limb people paid attention to cymry they clearly knew what she was and they looked at her and by extension her rider with respect or at least they did until they saw his black eye but even then they looked at him with respect only leavened with sympathy and since they werent galloping at a headlong pace but rather moving in and out of the traffic at a respectable but easy trot some people actually began to call greetings to him and her newchosen aye lad said a farmer perched so high on the seat of his wagon that he was eyetoeye with skif and without waiting for an answer added here catch and tossed him a ripe pear startled he caught it neatly and the second one that the same man tossed to him before cymry found another opening in the traffic and moved smoothly ahead if youd cut that up into quarters id like some he was only too pleased to oblige since he had the feeling that was what the farmer intended anyway the little eating knife he always kept in his belt was accessible enough and since he didnt have to use the reins he didnt have to try and cut the pears up onehanded she reached around and took each quarter daintily from his hand as he leaned over her neck to hand it to her everywhere he looked he met smiles and nods it was a remarkable sensation not only to be noticed but to elicit that reaction in total strangers he did feel rather naked though he wasnt at all comfortable with all of this noticing dont worry youll blend in once youre in your grays youll be just another trainee he was getting used to her talking in his head mindspeech she called it and he was starting to get vague pictures and other associations along with the words when she talked about being in his grays he knew at once that what she meant was the uniform of the heraldic trainees modeled after the heralds own uniforms but gray in color thats so people dont expect you to know what youre doing yet she told him looking back over her shoulder at him with one eye and by the way you dont have to actually talk to me for me to hear and understand you so she knew what he was thinking that wasnt exactly a comforting thought a man liked to have a little privacy and when youre a man ill give it to you hey he said staring at her ears indignantly and garnering the curious glances of a couple driving a donkey cart next to him oh dont be so oversensitive i wont eavesdrop youll just have to learn not to shout all your thoughts great now he would have to watch not only what he did and said but what he thought this herald business was getting more unpleasant all the time its not like that skif she said coaxingly really it isnt i was just teasing you he found a smile starting no matter how he tried to fight it down how could he possibly stay angry with her how could he even get angry with her and maybe that was the point he wasnt sure how long it had taken them to get from the park where hed found her to the way station where they stopped but it took them most of the morning to get back to haven the guards on the walls paid absolutely no attention to him although they had to have seen him careening down the road yesterday cymry didnt volunteer any information as he craned his neck up to look at them then bestowed a measuring glance at the two on either side of the passage beneath the wall he wondered what they were thinking and what they might have said or done yesterday they sure didnt try to stop us anyway not that it was likely that theyd have had much luck not with only two guards on the ground and cymry able to leap a farm wagon without thinking about it maybe it was just as well they hadnt tried he might have ended up with both eyes blackened once they got inside the city walls though people stopped paying as much attention to them well that wasnt such a surprise people saw heralds coming and going all the time in haven on the whole he felt a bit more comfortable without so many eyes on him their progress took him through some areas he wasnt at all familiar with as they wound their way toward the palace and the collegia he didnt exactly have a lot to do with craftsmen and shopkeepers his forte was roof walking and the liftin lay not taking things from shops that had always seemed vaguely wrong to him anyway those people worked hard to make or get their goods and taking anything from them was taking bread off their tables helping himself to the property of those who already had so much they couldnt keep track of it now that was one thing but taking a pair of shoes from a cobbler whod worked hard to make them just because he took a fancy to them was something else again once they got in among the homes of the wealthy though it was a different story he eyed some of those places all closekept behind their shuttered windows with a knowing gaze at one point or another he had checked out a great many of them and he knew some of them very very well indeed the owner of that one had not one but two mistresses that his wife knew nothing about and they didnt know about each other he treated them all well though so to skifs mind none of them should have much to complain about sometimes he wondered however where the man was getting all the money he spent on them hes honest enough but there are others cymry put in you see what i mean by needing your skills he furrowed his brow and concentrated on thinking what he wanted to say instead of saying it out loud i suppose he said dubiously but they were soon past the second wall out of the homes of the merely wealthy and in among the manses of the great and skif had to snicker a little as they passed lord orthallens imposing estate it was the first time hed come at it from the front but he couldnt mistake those pale stone walls for any other how many times had he feasted at mlords table and him all unaware they passed lord orthallens home passed others that skif had not dared approach so guarded around were they by the owners own retainers and finally there was nothing on his right but the final wall blank and forbidding that marked the palace itself his apprehension returned and he unconsciously hunched his head down trying to appear inconspicuous even though there was no one to see him no there was someone the next turning brought them within sight of a single guardsman in dark blue who manned a small gate cymry trotted up to him quite as if she passed in and out of that gate all the time and the man nodded as if he recognized her this would be cymry he said aloud casting a jaundiced eye up at skif who shrank within himself theyre expecting you he continued opening the gate for them to pass through although he didnt say who they were cymry walked through all dignity and began to climb the graveled road that led toward an entire complex of buildings skif tensed now im in for it he thought and felt his heart drop down into his boots he sat in cymrys saddle like a sack of grain and waited for doom to fall on him she had taken him up the path through what looked like a heavilywooded park past one enormous wing of a building so huge it had to be the palace eventually they came to a long wooden building beside the river in the middle of a huge fenced field hed have called it a stable except that there werent any doors on the stalls then again if this was where companions stayed there wouldnt be any need for doors on the stalls would there it had a poundeddirt floor covered ankledeep in clean straw and there was a second door on the opposite side also open these gave the only light cymry walked inside quite at home the building was oddly deserted except except for three people who were very clearly waiting for him just inside the door one was an odd birdlike man slight and trim hardly taller than skif with a cap of dark gray hair and an intelligent though worried expression the second was taller with a fairly friendly face which at the moment also bore a distinctly worried expression both of them wore the white uniform only a herald was allowed to wear his welcoming committee evidently he couldnt see the third one very well since he was standing carefully back in the shadows the third person wasnt wearing the white uniform though his clothing was dark enough to blend in with the shadows could be sommut from the guard he thought gloomily gonna haul me off t gaol soons the other two get done with me hes not and youre not going to gaol said cymry but that was all she said he couldnt find it in himself to feel less than uneasy about the shadowy lurker she stopped a few paces away from the two men and skif gingerly dismounted turning to face them with his hands clasped behind his back a moment later he dropped his eyes whatever was coming he didnt want to meet their faces and see their disgust so said the smaller one you seem to be the young person that companion cymry has chosen yessir skif replied gazing at his illshod toes and were given to understand that you ah your profession you the man fumbled for words and skif decided to get the agony over with all at once m a thief sir he said half defiantly thas what i do he thought about adding any number of qualifying statements that it had been a better choice than working for his uncle that no one had offered him any other sort of employment and he had to eat even that if bazie hadnt been around to take him in and train him hed probably be dead now and not chosen but he kept all of those things to himself for some reason the clever retorts he had didnt seem all that clever at the moment the shorter man sighed i suppose youre expecting me to give you an ineffective and stuffy lecture about how you are supposed to be a new person and you cant go on doing that sort of thing anymore now that youre a trainee skif stopped looking at his toes and instead glanced up startled at the speaker uh youre not you are not stupid the man said and smiled faintly though his tone sounded weary if youve already played over that particular lecture in your mind then i will skip it and get to the point i am dean elcarth i am in charge of heralds collegium the moment you entered the gate here so far as we are concerned whatever you were or did before you arrived here became irrelevant you were chosen the companions dont make mistakes there must be the makings of a herald in you therefore you are welcome but when you get in trouble and you will because sooner or later at least half of our trainees get in trouble please remember that what you do reflects on the rest of us as well and heralds are not universally beloved among a certain faction of the highborn the others will give you the details as they see fit but the sum of what i have to say is that you are supposed to be part of a solution not part of a problem and i hope we can show you why in such a way that you actually feel that in your deepest heart during this rather remarkable speech skif had felt his jaw sagging slowly it was not what he had expected to hear his shock must have been written clearly on his face because the dean smiled a little again this is herald teren he continued gesturing to the other man who although friendlier was looking distinctly worried he is technically in charge of you since he is in charge of all of the newly chosen youll be getting your first lessons from him and he will show you to your new quarters and help get you set up under normal circumstances he would have picked out a mentor for you among the older students but these are not normal circumstances so although one of the older students will be assigned as a mentor in actuality you will have a very different though altogether unofficial mentor that said a grating voice that put chills up skifs back myself would be he knew that voice and that accent though when hed heard it before it hadnt been nearly so thick and when the third figure stepped out of the shadows arms folded over his chest scarseamed face smiling sardonically he stepped back a pace without thinking about it skif had never seen the hair before stark black with thick streaks of white running through it because it had been hidden under a hood or a hat but there was no mistaking that saturnine face or those cold agategray eyes this was the sellsword whod spoken with and spied on jass who had threatened skif in the cemetery you he blurted this is herald alberich the collegium weaponsmaster said the dean and i will leave you with him and teren but you cant bbbe a herald skif stammered wheres yer yer white herald alberich has special dispensation from her majesty herself not to wear the uniform of heraldic whites herald teren interrupted as alberichs expression changed only in that he raised his right eyebrow slightly and now suddenly an explanation for skifs own rather extraordinary behavior in the cemetery hit him and he stared at the herald in the dark gray leather tunic and tight trews with something like accusation you truth spelled me now that he knew alberich was a herald there was no doubt in his mind why he had found himself telling the man what he knew that night in the cemetery everyone knew about heralds and their truth spell though skif was the first person in his own circle of acquaintances whod actually undergone it much less seen it the two heralds exchanged a glance elcarths right said teren hes very quick survive long he would not were he not alberich replied and fastened his hawklike eyes on skif who shrank back just as he had that night i did because there was need think on this had you by any other been caught it would not have been truth spell but a knife skif shivered convulsively despite the baking heat the man was right he gulped alberich took another couple of steps forward so that skif was forced to look up at him now since there is still need without truth spell what you were about in following that scum you will tell me and fully you will tell it there was something very important going on here he didnt have nearly enough information to know what or why but it was a lot more than just the fact that jass had been killed though that surely had a part in it but skif raised his chin stiffened his spine and glared back tyou not tim i know you i don know im the heralds exchanged another glance fair enough teren said easily ill be outside when youre ready for me to take him over herald teren turned and strode out the door on the other side of the stable skif didnt take his eyes off alberich whose gaze if anything became more penetrating heard you have of the man jass and his ending it was a statement not a question but skif nodded anyway and you followed him for moons why e burned down th place where mmates lived skif made it a flat statement in return and kept his face absolutely dead of expression they died i heard im say xactly that with mown ears an e didnt care all e cared about was e didn want t get caught fact e said e got rid of some witnesses afore e set th fire might evenve been them alberich nodded he was not nearly so free with me skif tightened his jaw honest i was in the cemtery by accident but i was where i could ear real good an i eard im an th bastid what hired im talkin bout a new job an talkin bout the old one i already figgered i was gonna take im down somehow but only after i foun out oo twas what give im th order a swift intake of breath was all the reaction that alberich showed and a very slight nod which was why you followed him a pause he was more than that more than just a petty arson maker more even than a murderer as his master was is which was why i followed him skif only shook his head alberichs concerns meant nothing to him except you know oo e is he shot out feeling himself flush with anger the boss you know he held himself as still as a statue although he would cheerfully have leaped on the man at that moment and tried to beat the knowledge out of him but alberich shook his head and it was with a regret and a disappointment that went so deeply into the tragic that it froze skif where he stood i do not he admitted hope i had you did at that moment instead of simply glaring at him alberich actually looked at him caught his eyes and stared deeply into them and skif felt a sensation like he had never before experienced it was as if he literally stood on the edge of an abyss staring down into it and it wasnt that if he made a wrong move hed fall it was the sudden understanding that this was what alberich had meant when hed said that these were waters too deep for skif to swim in there were deep matters swirling all around him that skif was only a very tiny part of and yet he had the chance to be a pivotal part of it if he dared if he cared enough to see past his own loss and sorrows and see greater tragedy and need and be willing to lay himself on the line to fix it chosen please this is real this is what i meant when i said that we needed you he gazed into that abyss and thought back at cymry as hard as he could is that the only reason you chose me because if it was if it was and all of the love and belonging that had filled his heart and soul when he first looked into her eyes was a lie a ruse to catch someone with his particular set of skills are you out of your mind she snapped indignantly shaken right out of her solemnity by the question cant you feel why i chose you that answer unrehearsed unfeigned reassured him as no speech could have and something in him shifted straining against a barrier he hadnt realized was there until that moment but he still had questions that needed answering an if ye find this master no matter how highborn e is he asked slowly yell do what bring him to justice alberich replied instantly and held up a hand to forgo any interruptions for murder of your friends if no other can be proved although there are others skif asked not in amazement no for if the bastard whoever he was had been coldhearted enough to burn down a building full of people he surely had other deaths on his conscience now for the first time alberichs face darkened with an anger skif was very glad was not aimed at him three of which i know and perhaps more and there is that which is worse than murder which only kills the body slaving for workers but worse to make pleasure slaves behind it he is in small in the selling of children here even from the streets of haven and in large very large wherein whole families are reaved from their homes and sold outkingdom skif heard himself gasp there had always been rumors of that in the streets and bazie had hinted at it but even his uncle hadnt stooped that low worse than murder well yes he closed his eyes a moment and thought about those rumors a moment if the rumors were more than that and the children orphans or the unwanted who vanished from havens streets ended up in the place where bazie had intimated they went and if there really were entire villages full of people who were snatched up and sold outkingdom worse he heard himself agreeing and one answer there is for such evil alberichs stonelike expression gave away nothing but skif wasnt looking for anything there he already had his answer forget anything else he and this ironspined man had a common cause and somewhere inside him the barrier strained and broke im in was all he said im with ye alberichs eyes flickered briefly then he nodded more we will speak and at length now there were a great many things alberich could have said if you want revenge youd better keep your nose clean for instance or if you get yourself thrown out of here for messing up neither one of us will get what he wants or youll have to work hard at being respectable because its going to take someone who looks respectable to trap this bastard he said none of those things he let another of those penetrating looks analyze skif and say something else something that had warning in it but against danger and not mere misbehavior something that had acceptance in it as well and an acknowledgment that skif had the right to be in this fight and skif nodded quite as if he had heard every bit of it in words alberich smiled it was the sort of smile that said i see we understand one another that was all but that was all that was needed a moment later the sound of boots on the strawcovered floor marked herald terens return later speech we will have alberich promised as teren reached them for now other things the other things were not what skif had expected not that hed really had any inkling of what to expect but not even his vaguest intuitions measured up to his introduction to the collegium and his first candlemarks as a trainee if youre all right then follow me herald teren said and started off quite as if he assumed skif would follow and not bolt which skif did of course it seemed that he was in for it after all but not in the way hed thought his emotions were mixed to say the least on top of it all was excitement and some apprehension still just beneath that was a bewildered sort of wonder and the certainty that at any moment they would realize theyd made a mistake or that fearsome alberich would call the guards hed lived with what he was for so long beneath that though was something still of the new image of the world and his place in it that hed gotten during that encounter with alberich that granted the world stank and a lot of people in it were rotten and horrible things happened but that he little old skif petty thief had a chance that wasnt given to many people to help make things better not right the job of making everything right was too big for one person for a group of people like the heralds even but better and under all of that slowly and implacably filling in places he hadnt known were empty was a feeling he couldnt even put a name to it was big that feeling and it had been the thing that had broken through his barriers back there when cymry reaffirmed her bond with him it was compounded of a lot of things release relief those were certainly in there but with the release came a sense that he was now irrevocably bound to something something good and accepted by that something a feeling that he belonged at last to something hed been searching for without ever realizing that hed been looking and there was an emotion connected with cymry in there that if he had to put a name to it he might have said with some embarrassment was love it was scary having something that big sweep him up in itself and if he had to think about it he knew hed be absolutely paralyzed so he didnt think about it he just let it do whatever it was going to do turning a blind eye to it but he couldnt help but feel a little more cheerful a little more at ease here with every heartbeat that passed and there was plenty to keep him distracted from anything going on inside him anyway teren led him away from the stable and toward a building that absolutely dwarfed every other structure he had ever seen and if he was impressed he hated to think how all those farmboys and fisherfolk cymry had talked about must have felt when they first saw it the building was huge threeandahalf stories of gray stone with a fourstory double tower at the joining of two of the walls just ahead of them this is heralds collegium and the palace teren said waving his hand in an arc that took in everything you cant actually see the new palace part of the structure from here its blocked by this wing next to us which is where all the kingdoms heralds have rooms but most uv em dont live here at least not most of th time skif stated on a little firmer ground right teren nodded thats right the only heralds in permanent residence are the teachers at the collegium and the lord marshals herald the seneschals herald and the queens own herald have you any idea who they are skif shook his head not particularly caring that he didnt know this new feeling whatever it was had a very slightly intoxicating effect not a clue he said i figger yell tell me in them lessons right right well leave that to basic orientation it isnt something you need to understand this moment teren seemed relieved at his answer now straight ahead of us is heralds collegium which is attached to the residence wing both for the convenience of the teachers and he cast a jaundiced eye on skif to try and keep the trainees out of mischief skif laughed it was very clear from terens tone and body language that he meant all trainees not just skif he couldnt help but cast an envious glance at the wing beside them though he couldnt help but think that as a trainee hed probably be packed in among all the other trainees with very little privacy healers collegium and bardic are also on the grounds on the other side of heralds teren continued waving his hand at the threeandahalf story wing ahead of them youll share some of your classes with students from there healer trainees wear pale green bardic trainees wear a rust red rather than a true red there will also be students who wear a pale blue which is similar to but darker than the pages uniforms those are a mixed bag some of them are highborn whose parents choose to have them tutored here rather than have private teachers but most are talented commoners who are going to be artificers whats an artificer skif wanted to know people who build things bridges buildings contrivances that do work like mills pumps teren said absently people who dig mines and come up with the things that crush the ore people who make machines like clocks printing presses looms it takes a lot of knowing how things work and mathematics which is why they are here keep that away from me skif said with a shudder sums i had just about enough of sums well if you dont come up to a particular standard youll be getting more of them im afraid teren said and smiled at skifs crestfallen face dont worry you wont be the only one whos less than thrilled about undertaking more lessons in reckoning youll need it some day you may have to figure out how to rig a broken bridge or fix a wall they entered in at a door right in the tower that stood at the angle where the heralds wing met the collegium there was a spiraling staircase paneled in dark wood there lit by windows at each landing skif expected them to go up but instead they went down first housekeeping and stores teren informed him the kitchen is down here too now besides taking lessons youll be assigned chores here in the collegium all three collegia do this with their trainees the only thing that the trainees dont do for themselves is the actual cooking and building repair work skif made a face but then something occurred to him highborn too he asked highborn too teren confirmed it makes everyone equal and we never want a herald in the field to be anything other than selfsufficient that means knowing how to clean and mend and cook if need be that way you dont owe anyone anything because we dont want you to have anything going on that might be an outside influence on your judgment huh by now they had reached the lowest landing and the half cellar which wasnt really a cellar as skif would have recognized one since it wasnt at all damp and just a little cooler than the staircase teren went straight through the door at the bottom of the staircase and skif followed they entered a narrow whitewashed room containing only a desk and a middleaged woman who didnt look much different from any ordinary craftsmans wife that skif had ever seen she had palebrown hair neatly braided and wrapped around her head and wore a sober darkblue gown with a spotless white apron new one gaytha said teren as she looked up she gave him a different sort of penetrating look than alberich had this one looked at everything on the surface and nothing underneath youll be a ten i think she said and stood up pushing away from her desk exiting through a side doorway she returned a moment later with a pile of neatly folded clothing all in a silvergray color and a lumpy bag heres your uniforms now let me see your shoes when skif didnt move she gestured impatiently go ahead put your foot on the edge of the desk theres a lad she said with a shrug skif did as he was told and she tsked at his shoes well those wont do teren measure him for boots theres a dear while i get some temporaries she whisked back out again while teren had skif pull off his shoes made tracings of his feet then measured each leg at ankle calf and knee noting the measurements in the middle of the tracing of left or right by the time he was finished the housekeeper was back with a pair of boots and a pair of soft shoes both had laces and straps to turn an approximate fit into a slightly better one these will do until i get boots made that are fitted to you she said briskly now my lad i want you to know that there are very strict rules about washing around here this time the look she gave him was the daggerlike glare of a woman who has seen too many pairs of washed hands and arms that were dirty down to the wristbone a full bath every night and a thorough washup before meals or before you help with the meal if youre a server or a cooks helper if you dont measure up its back to the bathing room until you do even if all thats left to eat when youre done is dry crusts and water do you understand yesm skif replied he wasnt going to point out to this woman that a dirty thief is very soon a thief in the gaol that was just something she didnt need to know good she took him at his word for now he had no doubt hed be inspected at every meal until they figured out he knew what clean meant now i dont suppose you have any experience at household chores laundry an mendin is what id druther do dishes floor washin an scrubbin is what i can do but druther have laundry an mendin he said immediately can boil an egg an cut breadnbutter but nought else worth eatin laundry and mending the housekeepers eyebrows rose well if thats what youre good at we have more boys here than girls so we tend not to have as many hands as id like that are actually good at those chores her expression said quite clearly that she would very much like to know how it was that he was apt at those tasks but she didnt ask and skif was hardly likely to tell her this boy is skif chosen by cymry teren said as gaytha got out a big piece of paper divided up into large squares each square with several names in it ive got you down for laundry and mending for the next five days gaytha said teren will schedule that around your classes and meals well see how you do off we go then teren said and loaded skifs arms with his new possessions back up the steps they went pausing just long enough at the first floor for teren to open the door and skif to look through it this is where the classrooms are teren told him and he took a quick glance down the long hall lined with doors were on midsummer holiday right now so all but two of the trainees are gone on visits home its just as well with this heat no one would be able to study do what theys does in th city skif advised voice muffled behind the pile of clothing they aint gettin no holidays work from dawn till it gets too hot then go back tot when its cooled off a bit were ahead of you there teren told him its already arranged follow me up to the second floor teren went on ahead and skif found him holding open the door on the next landing he stepped into another corridor this one lined with still more doors but it ended in a wall and seemed less than half the length of the one on the first floor it was a bit difficult to tell because the light here was very dim there were openings above each door that presumably let the light from the room beyond pass through and that was it for illumination you wont be living on this side of the common room teren told him this is the girls side the common room where you take all meals is between the boys and girls side come along and youll see he led the way down the corridor opened a door and skif preceded him into the common room there were windows and fireplaces on both sides and the place was full of long tables and benches rather like an inn skif made a quick reckoning and guessed it could hold seventyfive people at a time a hundred if they squeezed in together how many of them trainees you got he asked as teren held the door in the opposite wall open for him fortyone twentysix boys fifteen girls teren turned to catch his grimace that does make for some stiff competition among the ladies or are you not interested in girls yet never thought bout it he said truthfully where i come from where i come from you don get no girl less you pays for er an i got better things tspend m glim on he thought but no point in shocking this man hed probably go white at the thought and this is your room teren said interrupting his thoughts opening one of the doors eager now to put down his burdens skif hurried through the door he was very pleasantly surprised there was a good bed a desk and chair a bookcase and a wardrobe it had its own little fireplace no hoping to get warmth from the back of someone elses chimney and a window that stood open to whatever breeze might come in all of it from the wooden floor to the furniture to the walls was clean and polished and in good condition though obviously muchused when skif set his clothing down on the bed he was startled to realize that it was a real mattress properly made and stuffed with wool and goose down not the canvascovered straw hed taken as a matter of course he had never not once slept on a real mattress hed only seen such things in the homes of the wealthy that hed robbed grab a uniform and ill take you to the bathing room teren told him before he could do more than marvel you need to get cleaned up and ill take you down to the kitchen for something to eat then ill take you to dean elcarth and he can determine what classes youll need to take it didnt seem that herald teren had any intention of leaving skif alone with a stifled sigh skif picked out smallclothes a shirt tunic trews and stockings debated between the boots and the shoes and finally decided on the latter as probably being more comfortable with an eye long used to assessing fabric he decided that the trews and tunic must be a linen canvas the shirt was of a finer linen the boots of a heavier canvas with leather soles and wooden heels interesting that the temporary boots were of canvas rather than leather theyd be quicker to make up and a lot more forgiving to feet that werent used to boots or even shoes some of the farmboys who came in to the markets went barefoot even in the city right up until the snow fell trailing behind the herald wondering if the man considered himself to be guide or guard skif left his room the bathing room was a shock copper boilers to heat the water one with a fire under it already pumps to fill them pipes carrying cold and hot water to enormous tubs and commodious basins boxes of soft sagescented soap and piles of towels everywhere skif forgot terens presence entirely no matter how hot it was he reveled in a bath like no one he knew had ever enjoyed he soaked and soaked until the aches of that horrible ride with cymry were considerably eased and he felt cleaner than he ever had in his whole life in fact it was only after hed dried off using a towel softer than any blanket hed ever owned and was half dressed in the new clothing that teren spoke waking him to the heralds presence mop up your drips with the towel you used and wipe out the tub then drop the towel down that chute over there send your old clothing after it teren nodded toward a square opening in the wall between two basins and skif finished dressing then obeyed him how long had he been there had he left while skif was filling the tub it bothered him that he couldnt remember i always know where people are am i losing my edge teren waited for him by the door but held out a hand to stop him before he went back through it hold still a moment would you he asked and put a single finger under skifs chin turning his face back into the light from the windows i thought most of that was dirt he said contritely i beg your pardon skif before i take you to elcarth id like you to see a healer for that nose and eye another moment of mixed reaction a little resentment that the man would think he was so slovenly that hed have that much dirt on his face and small wonder that the house keeper had been so abrupt but that was mingled with more astonishment a healer for a broken nose but within moments he found himself sitting across from a greenclad healer a fairly nondescript fellow who examined him briskly said this will only hurt for a moment and grabbed his nose and pulled it certainly did hurt quite as much as when hed hit cymrys neck in the first place it hurt badly enough he couldnt even gasp but the healer had spoken the truth it only hurt for a moment and in the very next moment it not only stopped hurting it stopped hurting he opened his eyes and both of them opened properly now and stared into the healers grin youll still look like a masked ferret the fellow said cheerfully but you should be fine now how did you do that anyway teren asked as they made their way back to heralds collegium and skifs interview with herald elcarth cymry jumped a wagon an i hit er neck with my face he replied ruefully and found himself describing the entire wild ride in some detail as they walked she made you think youd stolen her teren said at last smothering laughter forgive me but oh its pretty funny now skif admitted an i sppose itll be funnier in a moon or a season or a year last night i cn tell you it werent funny at all i can well imagine by this time they were back down the stairs into the half basement in the collegium again itll be funnier still when youve got yourself on the outside of some lunch heres the kitchen teren opened a door identical to the one that led to the housekeepers room but this one opened onto an enormous kitchen silent and empty i havent had anything since breakfast either he gave skif a conspiratorial wink lets raid the pantry usually our cook mero is down in the kitchen teren told him as they cleaned up what little mess theyd made now listen i am not telling you this because i think youre going to filch food im telling you this because all boys your age are always hungry and after the last couple of centuries running the collegium weve figured that out when mero is here you can ask him for whatever you want to eat and if he isnt kneedeep in chaos hell be delighted to get it for you when hes not here and i know very well from my own experience how badly you can need a midnight snack only take food from the pantry we just used the reason for that is that mero plans his meals very carefully he has to with so many inexpert hands working with him and if you take something he needs itll make difficulties for him skif thought fleetingly of the number of times hed taken food from lord orthallens pantry and hoped it hadnt made difficulties for that cook odd he wouldnt have spared a thought for that yesterday now healed fed and ready for dean elcarth teren didnt wait for an answer but strode off heading for the stairs this time they walked through the corridor that held all the classrooms again it was lit by means of windows over each classroom door from the spacing the rooms were probably twice the size of the one theyd given skif why so many and so much room maybe in case it was needed just because they only had fortysix trainees now didnt mean they couldnt have more at some other time and teren had said that the classes were shared with bardic and healer trainees and those others that would be interesting they passed through the double doors that marked the boundary between collegium and heralds wing and teren turned immediately to a door on the left this is where ill leave you for now i will see you tomorrow and well start basic orientation and a couple of the other introductory classes that way when everyone gets back and collegium classes start again youll be able to join right up he tapped on the door a muffled sound answered and teren opened it and putting a hand just between skifs shoulder blades gently propelled skif inside before he got a chance to hesitate the door shut behind him skif found himself in a cluttered room a very small room but one that from the open door to the side must be part of a larger suite there were four things in this room besides dean elcarth books papers chairs and a desk there were bookshelves built into the wall that were crammed full of books books and papers were piled on every available surface elcarth motioned to skif to come in and take the only chair that wasnt holding more books one with a deep seat and leather padding that was cracked and crazed with age he sat in it gingerly since it didnt look either sturdy or comfortable he should have known better nothing bad that hed assumed about the heralds ever turned out to be right the chair proved to be both sturdy and comfortable and it fit him as if it had been intended for him herald elcarth folded his hands under his chin and regarded skif with a mild gaze you he said at last are a puzzle i must say that myste and i have searched through every chronicle of the collegium and i cannot find a single instance of a thief being chosen weve had several attempted suicides three murderers which i will grant were all selfdefense and one of them was lavan firestorm but nevertheless they were murderers weve had a carnival trickster a horse sharper and a girl who pretended to be a witch told fortunes which turned out to be correct foresight but also took money for curses she never performed relying instead on the fact that shed be long gone before anyone noticed that nothing bad had happened to the person she cursed weve had a former assassin weve even had a spy but weve never had a thief skif tried to read his expression and didnt get any clues from it elcarth merely seemed interested so i have to ask myself skif why you what is it about you that is so different that a companion would choose you he tilted his head to the side looking even more birdlike alberich by the way has told me nothing of why he recognized you in fact he didnt say much at all about you except that he knew who you were but until kantor told him he had not known you were specifically a thief what dye wanta know skif asked the best way to limit the damage might be to get elcarth to ask questions so that he could carefully tailor his answers more to the point what do you want to tell me elcarth countered usually not always but usually the chosen sitting where you are start pouring out their life stories to me are you going to be any different i aint the kind tpour out mlife story to anybody skif replied trying not to sound sullen wondering just how much he was going to have to say to satisfy the deans curiosity i dunno i aint never hurt nobody i stick tthe liftin lay an roof work he hadnt given a second thought to whether elcarth would understand the cant but elcarth nodded picking pockets and house theft which explains why you were in that park in broad daylight taking advantage of the fact that no one was about in the heat hmm skif blinked how had your trail out of the city was shatteringly obvious elcarth pointed out not to mention hazardous from the moment cymry left the park with you there were witnesses many of them members of the city guard but that only tells me what you do not what you are and its what you are that is what i need to know at skifs silence he prodded a little more your parents dead he answered shortly but try as he might he couldnt stand firm in the face of elcarths gentle but ruthless and relentless questioning before very long elcarth knew something of his uncle londer of beel and of bazie and bazies collection of boys and he knew what had happened to all of them especially bazie and he knew about the fire he managed to keep most of the details to himself though at least he thought he did the last thing he wanted was to start unloading his rage on elcarth it was a handle to skifs character that skif didnt want the dean to have but he didnt manage to keep back as much as he would have liked though and just talking about it made his chest go tight his back tense and his stomach churn with unspoken emotion part of him wanted to tell this gentle man everything but that was the new part of him the old part did not want him to be talking at all and was going mad trying to keep him from opening his mouth any more than he had fortunately at that point elcarth changed the subject entirely quizzing him on reading figuring writing and other subjects that was what he had expected although he didnt care for it and his stomach soon settled again it took longer for the tension to leave his back and chest but that was all right the tension reminded him that he needed to be careful outside the office the day moved on and the heat wave hadnt broken thick as these stone walls were the heat still got into elcarths office and both of them were fanning themselves with stray papers before the interview was over i think i can place you now elcarth said by late afternoon but im going to be putting you in one class you probably arent going to appreciate figuring skif groaned actually no not immediately im going to ask gaytha to teach you how to speak properly elcarth sat back and waited for skifs reaction if hed expected skif to show resentment he got a surprise himself huh i spose i can see that though you shoulda eard heard me afore before bazie got hold of me actually he wasnt at all displeased you didnt get to be a good thief by being unobservant and skif had known very well that his speech patterns would mark him out in any crowd as coming from the bad part of town near exiles gate if he was going to consort with the highborn and be taken seriously hed better stop dropping his hs among other things and he might as well start being careful about how he spoke now is that all you want with me he asked watching every syllable adding as an afterthought sir for now elcarth studied him and skif forced himself not to squirm uncomfortably under that unwavering gaze i hope eventually youll feel freer to talk to me skif he looked for a moment as if he was about to say more then changed his mind i believe you have another interview before you i skif began but a tap on the door interrupted him come called elcarth and the door was opened by herald alberich who was of course the very last person that skif wanted to see at this moment when elcarth had him feeling so unbalanced and unsettled alberich looked at him for a moment but not with the gaze of a hawk with prey in sight but with a more measuring even stare come i have to take our new one off elcarth he said simply companions field i think cooler it will be there well im satisfied with him so hes all yours elcarth replied making skif wince a little but alberich smiled ever so slightly your cymry is anxious to see the work of the healer he said to skif and it is that i have evaluation of my own to make please come he reached out and beckoned with one hand and skif got reluctantly to his feet unlike teren alberich did not seem inclined to lead skif anywhere instead he paced gravely beside skif hands clasped behind his back indicating direction with a jerk of his chin they left the heralds wing by the same door through which theyd first entered the collegium skif recognized the spot immediately there were plenty of trees here and skif was glad of the shade and glad of the light color of the trainee uniform he hated to think what it would have been like if the outfit had been black to the riverbank i think alberich said with one of those chin jerks you are puzzled by my accent well aye skif admitted never heard naught like it nor will you it is from karse that i am a captain i was in the service of vkandis sunlord with a glance at skifs startled face alberich then turned his face up toward the cloudless sky we have something in common i think or will have the thief and the traitor neither to be trusted outside the heraldic circle that is skif swallowed hard a karsite a karsite offlcer from the army of valdemars most implacable enemy but why that is what i we for kantor suggested this wish to be telling you alberich said gravely as they approached the riverbank his face cleared then as they rounded a section of topiary bushes and the river appeared dazzling in the sun ah there they are two companions waited for them and skif knew cymry from the other immediately though how he couldnt have said he rushed to greet her and as he touched her he felt enveloped in that same wonderful feeling that had been creeping in all afternoon past doubts past fears past every obstacle he pulled her head down to his chest and ran his hands along her cheeks while she breathed into his tunic and made little contented sounds he could have stayed that way for the rest of the afternoon but alberich cleared his throat politely after a time and skif pulled away from her with great reluctance a grotto there is in the riverbank cool as a cellar in this heat and our companions will enjoy it as well cymry seemed to know exactly where they were going so skif let her lead him skif kept one hand on her neck and followed along she led him down a steeplysloped grassy bank to the edge of the river itself and there partly out of sight from the lawn above was a kind of ornamental cave carved into the bank just as alberich had said it was just about tall enough to stand up inside and held three curved stone benches at the back nicely paved ceilinged and walled with flagstone it was wonderfully cool in there and the two companions took up positions just inside switching their tails idly as alberich and skif took seats on builtin benches at the back this wasnt so bad without the herald looming over him without actually having to look him in the eyes skif felt more comfortable and in the dim coolness the herald seemed a bit more relaxed alberich cleared his throat again as soon as they settled so it is you who have been telling tales for the most of today let someone else for a candlemark suits skif said shortly and leaned back into the curved stone bench karse alberich began meditatively i left my land and to an extent my god they call me traitor there think you it is odd that i love them both still i dunno skif replied honestly dunno much bout gods an truth ttell i never thought overmuch bout anythin like a whole country mostly didn think bout much past mown streets alberich nodded a little his gaze fixed on the river flowing outside the grotto no reason there was why you should skif shrugged ol bazie he didn think much of karse an i reckon he thought pretty well of valdemar when it comes down tcases least skif thought hard for a moment back to those memories that he hadnt wanted to think about at all for a very long time now huh when he lost is legs twasnt karse as saw im healed nor the tedrels twas valdemar an he ad some good things tsay bout heralds tell me alberich urged mildly and skif did it was surprising when he came to think about it how much good bazie had said about valdemar and its heralds especially considering that hed fought against both alberich sighed i love my land and my god he said when skif was through but both have been are being ill served and that is neither the fault of the land nor the god he told his story concisely using as few words as possible but skif got a vivid impression of what the younger alberich must have been like and when he described being trapped in a building that was deliberately set afire to execute him skif found himself transposing that horror to what bazie and the boys must have felt but there had been no companion leaping through the flames to save them there had been no happy ending for bazie it was the kings own and another herald who came at kantors call alberich said meditatively which was for my sake a good thing few would question talamirs word fewer dared to do so aloud so i was healed and i learned yes he said after he glanced at skif oh smile you may that into grays i went and back to schooling at that age a sight i surely was he shook his head why skif asked why didn you just tell em t make you a herald straight off and knowing nothing of heralds or valdemar stubborn i am often stupid never much i had to unlearn more did others have to learn of me selenay after talamir was my friend and advocate after them others more than enough work there was here to keep me at the collegium replacing the aged weaponsmaster more than enough reason to stay that others have me beneath their eye and so feel control over me in their hands he smiled sardonically did they know what i learn for the queen here it is that they would send me out to the farthest border ere i could take breath thrice since skif had seen him at work he snickered alberich bestowed a surprisingly mild glance on him now your turn it is for answering questions he said and skif steeled himself but first of all because i would know why choose to be a thief an odd question and as unexpected as one of alberichs rare smiles skif shrugged twas that or slave for mnuncle londer wasnt much else goin an bazie was all right his heart contracted at that all right what a niggardly thing to say about a man who had been friend teacher and in no small part savior yet if he said more he put his heart within reach of this herald this alberich who had already said in so many words that he would use anything to safeguard valdemar the queen and the heralds and thats bad how whispered that new side of him shut up replied the old skif became aware that a moment of silence had lengthened into something that alberich might use to put a question he filled it quickly bazie was pretty good tus actually he paused you gonna truth spell me again alberich shook his head what i did was done in need and haste much there is i would learn of you but most of it will wait and what i would know i think you will tell freely for the sake of your friends so now for a second time alberich asked questions about jass and jass master this time helping skif to pry out the least and littlest morsel of information in his memory this time though the questions came thoughtfully as slow as the heatheavy air drifting above the riverbank and cloaking it in shimmer each question considered and answered with the same care alberich was right about this much in this case alberichs goals and skifs were one and the two voices inside him were at peace with one another the light had turned golden as they spoke and the heat shimmer faded there had been a long time since the last question and skif slowly became aware that lunch was wearing thin as his stomach growled alberich glanced over at him again with a halfsmile you know your way about i think the weaponsmaster said tomorrow we will meet and you will begin your training with me and with others then with no other word of farewell alberich rose and stalked out his companion falling in at his side like a welltrained drill partner youve been mighty quiet skif said to cymry in the silence you were doing perfectly well without me she replied with a saucy switch of her tail well here you are left perfectly alone on the palace grounds you can go and do whatever you want no keeper no guardian you could go climb to the palace roof if you wanted to bearing in mind the queens guard might catch you or hasnt that occurred to you yet it hadnt and the revelation hit him like a bucket of cold water you sure he gasped as sure as im standing here she switched her tail again but this time with impatience they trust you isnt it time you started to trust them just start thats all an odd heavy feeling came into his throat once again the sense that something portentous had happened something that he didnt understand came over him it was more than uncomfortable it was unsettling in the sense of feeling the world he knew suddenly shift into something he no longer recognized im hungry he announced hastily shunting it all aside an i reckon i saw some ham an bacon in that pantry cymry whickered it sounded like a chuckle i reckon you saw more than that go on come back and meet me here once youve stuffed yourself skif got up and now that he was moving again he felt every single bruise and strain from yesterdays ride was it only yesterday it felt like a lifetime ago as he got up he actually staggered a little with stiffness cymry moved quickly to give him a shoulder to catch himself on and after hed steadied himself he gave her a selfconscious little kiss on her forehead go on she said playfully giving him a shove with her nose just dont eat until youre sick you didnt become a successful thief without learning the layout of a place on the first time through it nevertheless skif couldnt help but feeling a little selfconscious as he made his way across the grass overshadowed by the silent building and he couldnt help looking for those who might be looking for him but there were no watchers cymry had been right and when he left the heat of the outdoors for the cool of the great kitchen he discovered it just as deserted as it had been when teren brought him he opened the pantry doors and stood amid the plenitude gazing at the laden shelves and full of indecision bacon or ham white bread or brown it was too hot to eat anything cookedup fresh besides being far too much trouble but there was an abundance of good things that could be eaten cold his mouth watered at the sight of a row of ceramic jars labeled pikld beets but the discovery of a keg of large sour cucumber pickles made him change his mind about the beets there were so many things here that he had only tasted once or twice and so many more hed seen but never tasted but although cymry had warned him playfully about eating himself sick he was mindful of that very consideration too many times hed seen people in his own streets do just that when encountering unexpected abundance after all none of this was going to disappear tomorrow or even later tonight unless he ate it and he wasnt going to have his access to it removed either when this cook gets back twork oh there was a thought if there was so much here ready for snacking what wonderful things must the cook prepare every day visions of the kinds of things hed seen in the best inns passed through his mind mincedmeat pasties stews with thick rich gravy egg pie and oh the sweets eventually he made his selections and put a plate together he ate neatly and with great enjoyment savoring every bite finishing with a tart apple and a piece of sharp cheese then as he had when he had eaten earlier with teren he cleaned up after himself and put everything away a glance through the windows above the great sink as he was washing up showed him that the sky had gone to red as the sun set there would be plenty of time to spend with cymry and at that moment there was nothing in the world that he would rather have been doing back up and out he went under a sky filled with rededged purple clouds passing trees just beginning to whisper in an evening breeze through the quietude that seemed so strange to him after the constant noise of the city proper cymry waited for him where he had last seen her watching the sun set and turn the river to a flat ribbon of fire he put an arm over her shoulder and they watched it together how many times had he watched the sun rise or set above the roofs of the city too many to count certainly but hed never had as much time as he would have liked to enjoy the sight even when it was a truly glorious one like tonight come to that there had never been anyone with him who understood that it was a glorious sight until tonight bazie would have but bazie had spent most of his time in the cellar room and there was never the time or leisure for his boys to bring him up for a sunset they stood together until the last vestige of rose faded from the clouds and only then did they realize that they were not alone behind them were another herald and companion who must have come up behind them so quietly that not even skifs instincts were alerted and that took some skill skif didnt even know they were there until cymry reacted with a sudden glance over her shoulder a start and a little jump then he looked behind and saw the strangers he turned quickly sure that they were somewhere they shouldnt have been but the tall elderly man standing with one arm around his companions shoulders even as skif had stood with cymry smiled and forestalled any apology i beg your pardon youngling for startling you the man said his voice surprisingly deep for one as thin as he was we often come here to admire the sunset and didnt see any reason to disturb your enjoyment rolan tells me that you are skif and cymry the mans uniform was a touch above the ones that herald teren and dean elcarth had worn there was a lot of silver embroidery on the white deerskin tunic and skif would have been willing to bet anything he had that the trews and shirt this herald wore were silk the companion was something special as well he was just a little glossier just a little taller and had just a touch more of an indefinable dignity than any of the others skif had seen thus far did this is the queens own herald talamir and rolan the groveborn cymry said hastily in his mind in a tone that told skif even though he had no idea what the titles meant that these two were somehow very very special even by the standards of heralds yessir herald talamir skif said with an awkward bob of his head it was a very odd thing he had seen any number of highborn and never felt any reason to respect them he did respect the heralds hed met so far but this man without doing more than simply stand there somehow commanded respect but at the same time there was an aura of what beel might have called mortality and what others might have called fey that hung about him the heralds smile widened and i see that you and cymry mindspeak that is excellent especially in so early a bond talamir stepped forward and extended his hand to skif and when skif tentatively offered his own took it and shook it firmly but gently welcome skif was all he said but the words were a true greeting and not a hollow courtesy thankee sir skif replied feeling an unaccountable shyness a shyness that evidently was shared by cymry who kept glancing at the other companion with mingled awe and admiration talamir seemed to expect something more from him and he groped for something to say thiss all kinda new tme so im told mild amusement no more no sign that talamir had been told anything of skifs antecedents well if you feel overwhelmed remember that when i first arrived here i was straight out of a horsetrading family id never spent a night in my life under anything but canvas and the largest city i ever saw was a quarter of the size of haven my first night in my room was unbearable i thought i was going to smother and i kept feeling the walls pressing in on me eventually i took my blankets outside and slept on the lawn very few of us are ready for this when we arrive here and he chuckled softly the merest ghost of a laugh sometimes here is even less ready for us but we adapt the trainee to the collegium and the collegium to the trainee even if it means pitching a tent in the garden for a trainee to live in for the first six months skif gaped totally unable to imagine this elegant gentleman living in a tent but quickly shut his mouth yessir he replied his usually quick wits failing him he had no idea how to end this conversation but the herald solved his dilemma for him have a good evening youngling talamir said and he and his companion turned and drifted off through the dusk like a pair of spirits making no sound whatsoever as they moved over the grass the moon threequarters now had just begun to rise and its light silvered them with an eldritch glow ist just me skif asked when he was pretty sure they were out of earshot or are they spooky theyre spooky cymry affirmed with an allover shiver of her coat rolan is talamirs second companion taver was killed in the tedrel wars when talamir and jadus were trying to rescue the king they say that everyone thought talamir was going to follow taver and king sendar until rolan came and pulled him back ever since then talamirs been otherworldly half his heart and soul are here and halfs in the havens they say skif shook his head all this was too deep for him still cymry continued shaking off her mood his mind is all here and talamirs mind is better than four of any one elses would you like to see companions field i thought this was companions field skif replied confusedly she made a chuckling sound this is only the smallest corner of it most of it is across the river think you can get on my back without a boost please i can pull mself up a gutter on troof without usin legs he retorted i oughta be able t get on your back she stood rock still for him and after a moment of awkwardness he managed to clamber onto her bare back stepping out into the twilight at a brisk pace she took him across the river on a little stone bridge and they spent a candlemark or two exploring companions field finally the long day caught up with him and skif found himself yawning and nodding catching himself before he actually dozed off and fell off cymrys back cymry brought him right back to the place where theyd met and from there he stumbled up to his room someone had come along and lit the lanterns set up along the walls so at least he wasnt stumbling because he couldnt see when he got to the door of his room he discovered that someone had also slipped a card into a holder there that had his name on it a sound in the corridor made him turn his eyes met the brilliant blue ones of an older boy hair soaking wet and wrapped in a light sleeping robe on his way out of the bathing room the other boy smiled tentatively hullo he greeted skif im kris you must be the new one skif its me and jeri here over midsummer uh hullo he eyed kris carefully definitely highborn with that accent and those manners but not one with his nose in the air jeri a girl or a boy girl shell be your yearmate got chosen six moons ago oh i made sure i left enough hot water for a good bath thanks that decided him maybe hed already had one bath today but he was still stiff and sore and another wouldnt hurt kris was still looking at him quizzically i hope you dont mind my asking but how did you get that black eye its a glory if you havent seen it its gone all green and purple around the edges and black as black at your nose smacked it inta cymrys neck skif admitted ruefully aint never jumped on a horse afore kris winced in sympathy ouch better go soak good night night skif replied and got a robe of his own to take the boys advice when he got back to his room and started putting his new belongings away to clear his bed so he could sleep he found one last surprise on the desk were all of his things every possible object he owned except the most ragged of his clothing from both his room next to jass and the priory including his purse with every groat still in it startled he tried to think at his companion cymry he called her hoping shed answer what do you need she asked sleepily and he explained what hed found who did that and how come he finished it worried him oh that would be alberichs doing i expect she replied usually they go send someone to tell families that the chosens arrived safely and to get their belongings if they didnt bring anything with them dont you want your things well of course he wanted his things i just the fact was he worried who went there what theyd said and how theyd known where he came from kantor says it was all alberichs doing at least getting your things from your room well that was one worry off his mind alberich would have gone as the sellsword and intimidated his way in good enough he sent off the usual guardsman to the priory theyll have told the priory you were chosen and the guardsman would have brought someone hired to take your place so the priory wont go shorthanded kan for says alberich didnt tell your old landlord anything is that all right since it was exactly what he would have wanted had he been asked he could only agree aye thats fine i reckon in fact he couldnt think of anything else he could possibly want get some sleep she told him itll be a long day tomorrow a longer one than today with a sigh he climbed into bed feeling very strange to be in such a bed and even stranger not hearing the usual noises of the city beyond his walls but not so strange that he was awake for much longer than it took to find a comfortable position and think about closing the curtains hed left open to let in every bit of breeze about the time he decided it didnt matter he was asleep a scant week later skif was just about ready to face all the returning trainees he knew what the heralds of valdemar were about now at least he knew where theyd come from and what they did and he was starting to get his mind wrapped around why they did it if he didnt understand it well there were a great many things in the world that he didnt understand and that didnt keep him from going on with his life something had happened to him over the course of that week and he didnt understand any of it the things he had always thought were the only truths in the world werent not here anyway he was going to have to watch these heralds carefully they might be hiding something behind all this acceptance and welcome but since a lot of what was going on with him had to do with feelings he came to the unsatisfactory and vague conclusion that maybe it wasnt going to be possible to understand it he was caught up like a leaf in the wind and the leaf didnt have a lot of choice in where the wind took it if it hadnt been that cymry was a big part of that wind well she was and despite everything hed learned until this moment he found himself thinking and feeling things that would have been completely unlike the boy hed been a fortnight ago soft was what he would have called what he was becoming now but what he was now knew that there was nothing soft about where he was tending if anything it was hard as in difficult and difficult were the things he was learning and the things he was going to learn though truth to tell it was no more work than he was used to setting himself physical exertion the weapons work he was doing the riding none of it was as hard as roof walking book learning ha it was mostly reading and remembering not like having to figure out a new lock even the figuring the mathematics they called it wasnt that bad since he could already do his sums this new stuff was a matter of logic a lot like figuring out a lock the real difference was that he was obeying someone elses schedule and someone elses orders yet hed run to bazies schedule and bazies orders and thought no worse of it nor of himself for every objection his old self came up with the new one or cymry had a counter and if there was one thing he was absolutely certain of it was that he would not could not do without cymry she didnt so much fill an empty place in him as fill up every crack and crevice that life had ever put in his heart and make it all whole again to have cymry meant he would have to become a herald so be it it was worth it a thousand times over and once again just as when hed been with bazie he was happy he hadnt known what happiness was until bazie took him in moments of pleasure yes and times of less misery than others but never happiness hed learned that with bazie and since the fire he hadnt had so much as a moment of real unshadowed happiness now it was back not all the time and there were still times when he thought about the fire and raged or wept or both he wasnt going to turn his back on these people not until he figured out what their angle was but for the most part it was back like a gift something hed never thought to have back again after that he knew he couldnt leave out there without cymry hed go back to being alone against the world in here with her there was one absolutely true thing he was certain of cymry loved and needed him and he loved and needed her the rest well hed figure it all out as it came but he woke every day with two persistent and immediate problems to solve when his fingers itched to lift a kerchief or a purse he wondered what would happen if he gave in to the urge and when kris and jeri accepted him without question as one of themselves he worried what would happen when they and the rest of the trainees learned hed been a thief cymry might be the center of his world but hed had friends before in bazie and the boys and he liked having them he didnt want to lose the ones he was getting now he woke one morning exactly six days after he had arrived a day when he knew the rest of the trainees would begin coming back in signaling the beginning of his real classes tomorrow although it would probably take two or three more days for all of them to make it back it helped of course that they all had companions and however long their journeys were they would travel in a fraction of the time it took an ordinary horse to cross the same distance he had met most of his teachers and even begun lessons designed to allow him to fit into the classes with some of them he had no idea how many of them besides alberich and teren knew his background either and eventually it would come out secrets never stayed secret for long eventually someone would say something he had worried over that like a terrier with a rat in fact hed gone to bed that night thinking about it and when he woke it was with an answer at last whether it would be the right answer was another question entirely but he knew who to consult on it the collegium cook a moonfaced eternally cheerful man called mero had turned up three days ago the collegium bells signaling the proper order of the day had resumed when mero returned so now when skif awoke at the first bell of the day and went down to the kitchen at the bell that signaled breakfast he would join kris and the girl jeri and some of the teachers around a table in the kitchen for a real cooked meal with so few to cook for mero declined help in cooking but afterward they all pitched in to clean up some of skifs daydreams about food were coming to pass mero even made homely oat porridge taste special after breakfast came skifs first appointment of the day it wasnt exactly a class especially not this morning and this morning he could hardly eat his breakfast for impatience to get out to the salle where some of the weapons training was done he cleared the table by himself so that he could leave quickly he ran to the salle a building that stood apart from the rest of the collegia and for good reason since it needed to be a safe distance from anywhere people might walk accidentally or on purpose the trainees from all three collegia learned archery and even some of the blues the students who werent trainees at all and some of those archery students were to be frank not very good skif although he had never shot a bow in his life had proved to be a natural at it somewhat to his own surprise seeing that alberich had tried him with something a bit more lethal and less obvious than an arrow hed tried him in knife throwing skif had been terrifyingly accurate where his eye went so did whatever was put in his hand he had no idea where the skill had come from but at least his ability to fight with a knife or with the blunted practice swords was no better than anyone elses alberich had promised something in the way of a surprise for him this morning and skif was impatient to see what he meant as well as impatient to speak with him when skif arrived at the salle alberich was throwing a variety of weapons at a target set up on the other side of the room alberich was a hair more accurate than skif but alberichs skill came from training not a natural talent nevertheless skif watched with admiration as alberich placed his weapons knives sharpened stakes and small axes in a neat pattern on the strawpadded target he didnt interrupt the weaponsmaster and alberich didnt stop until all the implements hed lined up on a bench behind him were in the target the salle a long low building with smooth worn wooden floors was lit from above by clerestory windows this was because the walls were taken up with storage cabinets and a few fulllength mirrors for the rest there wasnt much just a few benches some training equipment and the door to alberichs office for all skif knew alberich might even have quarters here since he hardly ever saw the weaponsmaster anywhere else so you come in good time alberich said as the last of his sharpened stakes slammed into the target he turned toward skif picking up something from the bench where his weapons had been come here then let us see how these suit you these proved to be little daggers in sheaths that alberich strapped to skifs arms with the daggers lying along the in side of his arms once on they were hidden by skifs sleeves and he flexed his arms experimentally they werent at all uncomfortable and he suspected that with a little practice wearing them he wouldnt even notice they were there of my students only two are i think fit to use these alberich said jeri is one it is you that is the other look you he showed skif the catch that kept each dagger firmly in its sheath and the nearinvisible shake of the wrist that dropped it down into the hand ready to throw when the catch was undone skif was thrilled with the new acquisition what boy wouldnt be but unlike most if not all of the other trainees he had seen men knifed and bleeding and dead men and a woman or two even before he left his uncles tavern hed seen death at its most violent and he knew bonedeep and blooddeep that death was what these knives were for not target practice not showing off for ones friends death hidden in a sleeve small and silent waiting to be used death was a cold still face and blood pooling and clotting on the pavement death was floating bloated in the river death was ashes and bones in the burnedout hulk of a building death was someone you knew found still and cold and never coming back and these little toy daggers were death not to be treated lightly or to be played with but death was also being able to stop someone from making you dead can you kill a man alberich asked suddenly as skif contemplated the dagger in his hand skif looked up at the weaponsmaster as usual his face was unreadable depends on th man skif replied soberly if youre talkin in cold blood id a took jass down like a mad dog just cause he killed mfriends and ida done it soon as i knew who his master was in the dark in the back an if somethin happens an his master wont come up on whats due him mebbe id do him too if youre talkin in hot blood if i was come at myself someone wantin me dead aye id kill him alberich nodded as if that was expected so when are you going to display these to your friends he prodded it sounded casual but it was prodding skif shook his head these theyre for serious work not for showin off less you order me master alberich i aint even gonna wear these cept t practice thats like balancin a rock over a door t see who gets hit i aint got a hot temper but i got a temper like anybody else losin temper makes people do stupid things death was a fight over nothing and a lost temper and blood where a simple blow would have served the same purpose over and over again in the streets outside exiles gate death came when tempers worn thin by need or hurt anger or drink flared and blades came out alberich in his guise of the sellsword was one of the few in those taverns that skif had ever seen who went out of his way to avoid killing to avoid even causing permanent harm alberich gave a brief nod of satisfaction and went on to drill skif in the use of his new weapons he said nothing more as the knives went into the target again and again he was satisfied that skif was going to be sensible and dismissed the question as answered that was another thing that skif had come to realize about alberich in the last week where other people even a few heralds were inclined to harp on a subject that worried them alberich examined the subject asked his questions made his statements came to his decisions and left it alone if he trusted the person in question and he trusted skif that was a very very strange realization but when he had come to it last night it had been the catalyst for his own decision this morning master alberich he said when the knives had been taken off and wrapped up in an oiled cloth to keep the sheaths supple and catches rust free i got a thought sooner or later someuns gonna let it slip what i was an thats gonna cause some trouble alberich gave him one of those very penetrating glances but said nothing but i think that you want tkeep at least part of what i can do real quiet now the weaponsmaster nodded slightly have i not said it your skills could be more than useful skif clasped his hands behind his back so i had an ideer what if we go ahead an let part of it out just that i was on th liftin lay cause theres this aint too many as does the roof work an th liftin lay an if people know i done th one they wont look for tother he grinned i can turn it into a kinda rareeshow trick yken do th lift fer laughs id like he continued with a laugh tsee yon kris face when i give im his liddle silver horse back what he keeps in his pocket alberich raised one eyebrow you have the itching fingers he said though without accusation a bit skif admitted but what dyou think i think that you have the right of it alberich replied and skifs spirits lifted considerably it is your skill in other things and not as the picker of pockets that is of primary value at least for now and when you have your whites the novelty of your past will have worn off those within the circle will not trouble to speak of it and most outside the circle will never know of it so if there is a thing to be taken amidst a crowd of strangers you will likely not find eyes on you that made perfect sense one of the pickpockets skif knew had spent an entire year just establishing himself as a lame old beggar who was always stumbling into people then when no one even thought twice about him he began deftly helping himself to their purses and there wasnt a man jack of the ones that were robbed that even considered the lame old beggar was the culprit alberichs eyes looked elsewhere for a flicker of time then returned to him those who need to know what you are about he said will know the rest will see an imp of mischief he leveled a long gaze at skif skif shrugged wont keep nothing he said quite truthfully never took moren i needed tlive comfortable or bazie did that was bazies way start t take more get greedy get caught a wise man your bazie alberich replied with nothing weighting his tone skif shrugged again so i don need nothing here livin better than i ever did an you brought me my stuff with the purse of money left in the loft at the priory and when that money runs out what then if there is need for silver to loosen tongues or even gold the queens coffers will provide alberich said gravely giving skif a sudden chill for it seemed as if the weaponsmaster read skifs mind before skif even finished the thought and for the rest for there are fairs and there are taverns and perhaps there will be the giving and receiving of gifts among friends there is the stipend stipend skif asked stipend alberich smiled wryly some of ours are highborn used to pocket money some used to lavish amounts of it we could forbid the parents to supply it but why inflict hardship on those who deserve it not so the stipend all trainees receive it alike pocket money for small things since you have money already he paused and i am not asking you where it came from nor demanding that you give it back said the look that followed the pause then you will have yours on the next quarterday with the others oh uh thank you skif for once felt himself at a loss for words blindsided in fact this wasnt something he had expected another one of those unanticipated kindnesses there was no earthly reason why the heralds should supply the trainees him in particular with pocket money they already supplied food clothing wonderful housing entertainment in the form of their own games and the bardic collegium on the same grounds why were they doing these things they didnt have to trainees that didnt have wealthy parents could just do without pocket money but alberich had already turned away he brought out a longer knife and was preparing the salle for another lesson in street fighting that skif could understand and he set himself to the lesson at hand its a fools bet heraldtrainee nerissa cautioned a fascinated blue four weeks later dont take it but the look in her eyes suggested that although honesty had prompted the caution nerissa herself really truly wanted to see skif in action again eight trainees two from bardic collegium and six from heralds and three unaffiliated students were gathered around skif and a fourth blue in the late afternoon sunshine on the training field the group surrounding skif and the hapless blue were just as fascinated as nerissa and just as eager skif himself shrugged and looked innocent not a big bet he pointed out just tfix my window sos the breeze can get in and them those moths cant he says he can says he has for himself and his friends and i dont think itd put him out too much it seems fair enough to me said kris neither one of you is wagering anything he cant afford or cant do he pointed at the blue and you swore in the compass rose that skif could never pull his trick on you because you in particular and your plumbline set in general were smarter than the heraldic trainees the blues eyes widened how did you know that he gasped kris just grinned sources my lad he said condescendingly from the lofty position of a trainee in his final year sources and i never reveal my sources are you going to take the bet or not the blues chin jutted belligerently damn right i am he snapped witnessed called four herald trainees and one bardic at once just as alberich came out to break the group up and set them at their archery practice at the end of practice once alberich had gone back into the salle virtually everyone lingered and skif didnt disappoint them he presented the astonished blue with the goodluck piece that had been the object of the bet an ancient silver coin so worn away that all that could be seen were the bare outlines of a head the coin had been in a pocket that the blue had fixed with a buttoneddown flap an invention against pickpockets of his own devising that he was clearly very proud of in a panic the boy checked the pocket it was buttoned he undid it and felt inside his face was a study in puzzlement as he brought out his hand there was a coinshaped lead slug in it skif flipped his luck piece at him and he caught it amid the laughter of the rest of the group he was goodnatured about his failure something skif had taken into consideration before making the bet and joined in the laughter ruefully all right he said with a huge sigh ill fix your window as the blue walked off consoled by two of his fellows heraldtrainee coroc slapped skif on the back with a laugh i swear its as good as having a conjurer about the lord marshals son said well done howd you think of slipping him that lead slug to take the place of his luck piece skif flushed a little he was coming to enjoy these little tests and bets picking pockets was something he did fairly well but he didnt get any applause for it out in the street the best he could expect was a heavy purse and no one putting the watch on him this however he had an audience now and he liked having an audience especially an appreciative one i figured id better have something when kris told me that henk had been aboasting over in the compass rose an told me i had to uphold the heralds side skif replied with a nod to kris weve all seen that luck piece of his so it wasnt no big thing to melt a bit of lead and make a slug to the right size after that i just waited for him to say something i could move in on but when did you get the coin coroc wanted to know i mean alberich broke us up right after he took the bet and you didnt get anywhere near coroc stopped talking and his mouth made a little oh when he realized what skif had done you took it off him before the bet he exclaimed when there was all that joshing and shoving sure skif agreed i knew hed take the bet after all that about his special pocket hed never have passed it up he figured itd be a secret i wouldnt reckon out and id lose but even if kris hadnt told me id have figured it anyway he added the button shows when you look right and he aint no seamstress that buttonhole aint half as tight as it could be that last in a note of scorn from one who had long ago learned to make a fine buttonhole anyway i had to have the slug cause i knew once he took the bet hed be afingering that pocket t make sure his luck piece was there its a good thing you havent shown up a gift other than moderate thoughtsensing kris laughed or hed have been accusing you of fetching the thing skif preened himself just a little under all the attention if having skif around was entertaining for his fellow trainees the admiration each time he pulled off something clever was very heady stuff for skif hed begun beautifully a couple of days after full classes resumed when kriss best friend dirk had asked innocently where hed come from and what his parents did hed put on a pitiful act telling a long sad and only slightly embellished story of his mothers death the nearslavery at his uncles hands his running away and his tragic childhood in the slums near exiles gate all the while he was slowly emptying goodhearted dirks pockets but how did you live the young man exclaimed full of pity for him how did you manage to survive by this time of course since everyone in the three collegia loved a tale hed drawn a large and sympathetic audience oh skif had said taking dirks broad hand turning it palm upwards and depositing his belongings in it i turned into a thief of course poor dirks eyes had nearly bulged out of his head and this cap to a welltold tale had surprised laughter out of everyone else word very quickly spread but because of the prankish nature of skifs lifting there wasnt a soul in heralds collegium and not more than one or two doubters in bardic and healers that thought him anything other than a mischief maker and an entertaining one at that those few were generally thought of as sourfaced pessimists and their comments ignored not skif thought to himself somberly as he accepted the accolades of his fellows with a selfeffacing demeanor but what they mightnt be right about me cept for cymry except for cymry that pretty much summed it up everyone among the heraldic trainees was willing to accept skif as a harmless prankster because hed been chosen because companions didnt choose bad people and if anyone among the teachers thought differently they were keeping their doubts to themselves time to get to the baths kris reminded them otherwise the hot waters going to be gone that sent everyone but skif on a run for their quarters skif lingered not because he didnt care about getting a hot bath but because alberich had given him an interesting look that he thought was a signal he made certain that no one was looking back at him then sidled over to the salle entrance alberich was as he had thought waiting just inside working and working well is your plan of misdirection the weaponsmaster observed calmly so far skif waited for the rest there had to be more alberich wasnt going to give him a look like that just to congratulate him on his cleverness would it be that you would know the voice of jass master heard you it again alberich asked skif felt a little thrill run through him so alberich was going to use him he wasnt just going to have to sit around while the weaponsmaster prowled the slums in his sellsword guise i think so skif said after giving the question due consideration but hed have to be talking well hed have to be talking like he thought he was way above the person he was talking to condescending alberich nodded that i believe i can arrange there is to be a gathering of lord orthallens particular friends tonight get you to that place without challenge i can do it is for you to get yourself into a place of concealment where you can hear and observe but not be noticed oh i can do that skif promised recklessly you just watch i intend to since it will be myself at this gathering as guard to selenay with talamir alberich replied i wish you at the door into the heralds wing at the dishwashing bell he turned and retreated into the shadows of the salle and skif whirled and ran for the collegium he got his bath lukewarm but he hardly noticed and ate without tasting his supper in such haste that he came close to choking once he was in place long before the bell rang and alberich arriving early smiled to see him there and to see him in the uniform of a page the paleblue and silver that all of selenays pages wore come was all he said and he didnt ask where skif had gotten the uniform as it happened he hadnt stolen it hed won it fair and square another little bet hed had the feeling that he might need it at some point and he was still small enough to pass for one of the pages without anyone lifting an eyebrow wont be able tpull that much longer though he thought with regret hed learned a lot impersonating a page in lord orthallens service and he hoped to learn more slipping into the palace proper i trust you know how to serve alberich murmured as they walked together down the corridor servants whose duty it was to light the lamps passing by them without a second glance skif just snorted i should like to note alberich went on as they made a turn into the second half of heralds wing that i specified you be in a place of concealment hide in plain sight skif retorted when does any highborn look at a page unless it is his own kin a point you have made well this may serve better than having you lurking in the rafters alberich nodded a greeting to a herald just emerging from his room the other saluted him but showed no sign of wanting to stop and talk cant see nobodys face from the rafters skif pointed out they made another turning into a section that looked immensely old much older than the collegium or the wing attached to it skif looked about with avid curiosity they must be in the old palace now the square building upon which all later expansions had been founded the old palace was rumored to date all the way back to the founding of valdemar and it was said that king valdemar had used the old magics that were only in tales to help to construct it certainly no one in these days would have attempted to build walls with blocks of granite the size of a cottage and no one really had any idea how the massive blocks could have been set in place to the height of six stories there were even rumors that the blocks were hollow and contained a warren of secret passages unlikely skif thought but it would be impossible to tell unless you knew where a door was because the outer walls were at least two ells thick and you could tap on them until you were a graybeard and never get a hollow echo alberich stopped just outside a set of massive double doors this the reception chamber is the reception will be in slightly less than a candlemark your plan set an ready skif said boldly you go do whatever youre gonna do an leave me here alberich nodded and continued on his way skif checked the door of the chamber and found it as he had expected unlocked he slipped inside the walls were plastered over the stone and the plaster painted with scenes out of legends skif didnt even begin to recognize candle sconces had been built onto the walls to provide light later and there was an enormous fireplace truly large enough to roast an ox there was no fire in it now of course but someone had placed an oxsized basket of yellow orange and red roses between the andirons as a kind of clever fire substitute the room looked out into the courtyard in the center of the old palace here the walls were not of the massive thickness of the outer walls and the windows ran nearly floor to ceiling with a set of glass doors in the middle that could be opened onto the courtyard itself there were sideboards along the wall covered with snowy linen cloths set up to receive foodstuffs though none were there yet except two baskets of fruit candles and lanterns waited on one of the tables though none had been put in their sconces and holders nor lit skif took a tall wax taper and went out into the corridor lighting it at one of the corridor lamps he then went about the room setting up the lights quite as if hed been ordered to do so there seemed to be too many lanterns for the room so after consideration he took the extras out into the courtyard and hung them on the iron shepherds crooks he found planted among the flowers for that purpose roughly a quartercandlemark later a harried individual in royal livery stuck his head in the door and stared at him what did i order you to light the lamps he asked sounding more than a bit startled skif made his voice sound high and piping more childlike than usual yes milord he replied with a bob of his head you did milord the man muttered something under his breath about losing ones mind as the hair grayed then said carry on then waving a hand vaguely at him skif hid his grin and did just that it was one of the things hed learned impersonating a page at lord orthallens if a boy was doing a job rather than standing about idly people would assume hed been set the task and leave him alone even if the person in charge didnt recall setting the task or seeing the boy that person would take it for granted that it had just slipped his mind and leave the boy to carry on when the upper servant appeared again with a bevy of boys clad just as skif was in tow skif was relieved to see that none of them were the boy hed won his uniform from that had been his one concern in all of this and with that worry laid to rest he paid dutiful attention to the servants instructions he actually paid more attention than the real pages who fidgeted and poked each other but then they were yawningly familiar with what their duties were and he wasnt the food arrived then tidbits rather than a meal something to provide a pleasant background to the reception he managed to get himself by virtue of his slightly taller stature assigned to carry trays of wine glasses among the guests that was a plus hed be able to move freely where alberich would be constrained to go where the queen did when all was in readiness the doors into the courtyard now nicely lanternlit thanks to skifs efforts and the doors to the corridor were flung open the page boys took their places and the guests began to trickle by ones and twos into the room for the reception alberich stood at selenays right hand as she circulated among lord orthallens guests he wore his formal whites something he did only on the rarest of occasions he was not at all comfortable in what for the first two decades of his life had been the uniform not only of the enemy but of the demon lovers only three people knew that reason however to tell anyone but selenay talamir and myste would have been to deliver a slap in the face to those who had rescued and cared for him and taken them into their midst sometimes though he did wear the uniform when the need to do so outweighed personal discomfort in this case he wore his whites because he would be far more conspicuous in his favored dark gray leather than in his heraldic uniform talamir stood at selenays left where he could murmur advice into her ear if she needed it alberich stood on her right where his weapon hand was free he watched everyone and everything his eyes flicking from one person to the next and he never smiled this evidently bothered some though not all of lord orthallens guests the ones who had never seen alberich before and only knew of him by reputation those who frequented court functions were used to the way he looked at everyone as if he saw a potential assassin he did however everyone was a potential assassin of course the likelihood that any of them actually were assassins was fairly low but he was the herald who had saved selenay from death at the hands of her own husband cutting the prince down with the princes own sword he saw treachery everywhere or feigned that he did and when he looked at someone he didnt know with suspicion in his eyes that person tended to get very nervous sometimes he wished that he didnt have quite so formidable a reputation sometimes he wished that he could just look at someone and not have them flinch away that was about as likely at this point as for him to turn as handsome as young trainee kris that was what heraldchronicler myste said anyway looking at him from behind those peculiar splitlensed spectacles of hers that forced her pull her head back to peer down her nose when she was reading and tilt her chin down to peer through the top half when she was looking at anything past the length of her arms what do you expect shed ask him tartly the man wholl cut down a prince wouldnt hesitate at putting a blade in the heart of a man of lesser rank but for the gods sake dont ever try smiling at them you arent any good at faking a smile and when you try you look as if you were about to jump on people and tear their throats out with your teeth a pity myste was perhaps the herald who was the most inept with weapons in the entire circle he could do with a dose of her good sense here tonight not that shed enjoy it of course she would far rather be where she could avoid all this interminable nonsense in her quarters either writing up the current chronicles or going over old ones a glass of cold sweet tea at her elbow where she would probably knock it over at least once tonight hopefully when she did the glass would be empty if it wasnt well at least the papers on her floor were discards unlike the ones piled all over elcarths office alberich pulled his attention back to the reception the heat wave had finally broken though the thick stone walls of the old palace kept every room in it comfortably cool even during the worst of the heat with the doors open there was a pleasant scent coming from the roses in the courtyard no one had gone out there though for selenay and orthallen were in here no matter how tired anyones feet got he wouldnt leave where the power was if alberichs gaze rested more often than usual on a particular page circulating among the guests with a tray of wineglasses probably no one was going to notice it was a very ordinarylooking boy small dark curlyhaired if he moved more gracefully than the usual lot that wasnt likely to be noticed either alberich was pleased with the way he was looking up at the people he was serving not staring enough to make him seem insolent just paying respectful attention very good very smooth the boy must have done something like this before many times though alberich doubted it had been for any purpose other than to filch food from whatever noble household he had infiltrated lord orthallen on whose behalf this reception was being held also circulated among the guests quite as if he was the one who was the host and not the queen this particular festivity was a reward for those who had helped orthallen to conclude a set of delicate negotiations that would ultimately benefit the crown substantially according to myste alberich was not at all clear on just what those negotiations were only that they had involved a number of men and a few women of vastly disparate backgrounds many of whom had personal differences with each other one thing they all had in common though they were all very very wealthy that much showed in their costumes rich with embroidery and of costly materials and in their ornaments heavy gold and silver and precious gems the details didnt matter to alberich though myste would have been studying them with the eye of one who would be recording every subtle detail later in her writings that was the problem of living around a chronicler he never knew just what detail what secret that he assumed was just between them would end up in one of her histories to be goggled at by some other generation of heralds to come right now he was in the unusual position of having part of his attention devoted to something other than selenay and her welfare he watched that one small boy not as a hunter watched prey but as the prey watches a hunter alive to every nuance in his behavior waiting for the slightest sign that the boy recognized a voice hed only heard once when he told the boy that he could arrange for him to hear words spoken in tones of condescension he had not been promising more than he could deliver although these people had worked together for orthallens cause they had not forgotten rank and perceived rank and all of the tangle of quarrels that had made it so difficult to get them to work together they had merely put those things aside for the moment and although they were now basking in the unanticipated presence of royalty those things still remained where the queen gazed all was harmony but the moment that she took her attention away the claws were unsheathed though subtly subtly with a care not only for the queens presence but for the watchful eye of her guardian who might misinterpret what he saw and in alberichs case well no one wanted alberich to misinterpret anything so rather than bared claws and visible teeth there were mere hints of rivalries and competitions mostly carried out in tone and carefully chosen words oh there would be condescension in plenty among those able to read tone and words so exactly that they could choose to ignore what they heard or exaggerate the offense small wonder the crude bully jass hadnt heard what the boy had read in his masters tone the wonder was that the boy had read it so accurately well every herald every trainee is a wonder small or great it could be that this boy was or would be more of a wonder than most there were still those not heralds mostly who doubted the wisdom of having a thief as a trainee and the boy was not yet committed to becoming a herald alberich so apt at reading the unspoken language of gesture and tone knew that better than any if it had been a case of trusting to the boy by himself to come around to learn to trust to understand what it was they were doing alberich would have been the first to say no he is a danger to us and cannot be trusted past his own selfinterest but there was more than that there was the companion and so alberich was always the first not the last to say peace he will be ours soon enough the boy was good very good alberich had no difficulty in imagining him moving through a crowd of just about any sort of folk save perhaps the highest and remaining completely unnoticed he was after all a pickpocket that was the way of the game the unobtrusive prospered the rest wound up in gaol watching the boy was the only entertainment he had though and in the end the reception was as such things generally were deadly dull these people were small in the normal course of things no matter how wealthy they were they would never have seen selenay except from the back of the audience chamber or at most stood before her for a few brief moments while she passed some judgment in their favor or against them they would never have watched as she bent that cool thoughtful gaze on each one alone never have heard her inquiring as to the details of their lives for that moment of reflected glory they were content to be restrained and to keep their masks firmly in place their smiles unwavering and although the boy had shown a moment or two of hesitation there was no sudden recognition the reception came to its predictable end when selenay had had a private word with each and every one of orthallens guests and withdrew along with talamir and alberich and after that the guests would depart swiftly there being nothing there to hold them the boy skif would have to extricate himself from the toils of the page master as best he could and when he did just as swiftly as alberich had reckoned he would he found alberich waiting for him in his own room alberich had taken some thought to the needs of boys and had brought with him something other than the things good though they were that lay in meros free pantry he had gone down to the palace kitchen and commanded some of the dainties that selenays court feasted on he calculated that having had such things paraded beneath his nose all night the boy would not be emotionally satisfied with bread and cheese however good those common viands were and if he was anything like alberich had judged him he had not filled himself at dinner so when skif pushed open his own door there was alberich beneath a lit lantern mounted on the wall sitting at his ease in the boys chair the covered platter beside him on the desk the boy started but covered it well didn think tsee you afore the morrow he said matteroffactly as he sat down on his bed good service demands immediate reward alberich replied and uncovered the platter then pulled out the two glasses and halfbottle of wine from beneath the chair the boy gaped at him then shut his mouth and looked at the wine there was a brief flash of greed there but thankfully no need good that was one thing that alberich had worried about trouble with drink started early among those who lived near exiles gate alberich had seen children as young as ten caught by the addiction of drink there i didn think we was allowed skif began though his nose twitched as alberich uncorked it and he was young enough that his yearning showed a little more he must be getting very weary of the spring water fruit juice ciders teas and milk that were all the trainees were ever offered it is only half a bottle and i intend to share it with you alberich replied pouring the glasses full and handing him one that is hardly enough for even an innocent to be drunk upon i suspect youve had a deal stronger in your time already the boy accepted the glass and to his great credit took a mouthful and savored it rather than draining the glass so thiss what all the fuss is about he said after he allowed the good vintage to slip down his throat this is what the good stuffs like it is alberich agreed and now i fear it is spoiled youll be for the goat piss that passes itself off as wine near exiles gate dunno how you drunk it and thats for certainsure i allus did my drinkin a little higher up the street skif replied putting his glass down and reaching for the nearest tidbit a pasty stuffed with morels and duck breast of course he didnt know that until he bit into it and as it melted on his tongue the boys face was a study that very nearly made alberich chuckle he didnt though childrens dignity was a fragile thing and this lads rather more so than others they been passin those under my nose all night and if id known how they tasted skif shook his head this is too much like reward weaponsmaster the plain fact is there were three men that sounded something like the one we want and not one id be willin tfinger reward is not exclusively earned by accomplishing a task alberich noted pushing the platter toward the boy but taking a pastry himself he hadnt eaten any more than the boy had though selenay had nibbled all evening and he wanted something in his stomach to cushion the wine sometimes reward is earned just in the making of the attempt huh skif chose a different dainty and washed it down with wine now what dwe do i will try and find another opportunity to put you where you can observe some of the ones i suspect alberich told him if i do not it is that you will go to hunt on your own yes skif shrugged but alberich read in the shrug that he had considered doing so if he had not already made an attempt or two i got cause was all he said and left it at that meanwhile i hunt in a place you cannot for no boy however disguised would be permitted to the discourses of the great lords of state alberich continued skif cocked his head to the side shut the pages out do they he asked shrewdly and sighed not like i aint busy a most unchildlike child alberich reflected later as he left the boy to finish his feast but then most if not all of the children from that quarter were moreorless unchildlike theyd had their childhood robbed from them in various ways skifs was by no means the most tragic hed had a loving mother for however short a time hed had her hed had a kind and caring guardian and mentor in the person of the thief trainer that was more much more than many of his fellows had and if selenay had even an inkling of the horrors in the twisted streets of her own capital she would send out heralds and guard and all to scour the place clean there would be a grim forest of gallows springing up overnight and her own people would speak her name with hate and it would be all in vain for half a candlemark after wed gone the scum would all be back again this was the cost of welcoming any and all who sought shelter under valdemars banner sometimes what came in was not good not all or even many of the former tedrel mercenaries who had remained in valdemar were of bazies stamp alberich sought his quarters he actually had quarters both with the other heralds and in the salle but the latter was less convenient tonight it was too late or not late enough for a visitor his room was empty and in a way he was relieved he was not fit company tonight there was too much of a mood on him it was more of a relief to get himself out of the whites and into a sleeping robe and then into bed there had been a double reason for the wine this evening it was not only to prove to the boy that alberich considered him in some things to be an adult it was to make certain that tonight at least he would not be slipping out to snoop and pry on his own that taltherian wine was strong stuff alberich might have made certain that the greater part of the bottle went inside him but there was more than enough there to ensure that skif slept for that matter there was more than enough there to ensure that alberich slept he realized as he went horizontal and found a moment of giddiness come over him it came as something of a surprise but one he was not going to have any choice but to accept then again neither would skif which thought was a safeguard of sorts skif lay back against a bulwark of pillows propped up against the wall and headboard of his bed and stared out at the night sky beyond his open window not that he could see much even with his lantern blown out the lower half of the window was filled by a swath of cheesecloth stretched over a wooden frame that fit the open half of the window precisely you couldnt slip a knife blade between the frame and the window frame trust a blue to be that fiddly it worked though not a sign of moth or midge or fly and all the breeze he could want he thought he might want to dye the cloth black though eventually just to get that obtrusive white shape out of the way the wine alberich had brought had been a lovely thing about as similar to the stuff skif had drunk in the better taverns as chalk was to cheese hed recognized the power with the first swallow though and hed been disinclined to take chances with it hed stuffed his belly full of the fine foods alberich had brought which slowed the action of the wine considerably which was good because he wanted to think before he went to sleep he put his hands behind his head and leaned into his rather luxurious support luxurious damn right it is when the best my pillows have been till now was strawfilled bags this place was pretty amazing when it came right down to it maybe for some people the uniforms were a bit of a comedown but not even the worst of his was as mended and patched as the best of his old clothing and for the first time in his life to have boots and shoes that actually fitted him didnt know your feet wasnt supposed to hurt like that before his room had taken on the air of a place where someone lived in no small part because of skifs little wagers mindful of the impression he was hoping to create he always wagered for something he knew wouldnt put the person who was betting against him to any hardship so in many cases particularly early in the game that wager had been a cushion against a small silver coin which of course skif knew he wasnt going to lose skif preferred sitting in his bed to study unless he actually had to write something out and any trainee could make as many cushions for himself as he cared to fabric and cleaned feathers by the bagful were at his disposal in the sewing room as skif well knew palace and collegia kitchens went through a lot of fowl most of which came into the complex still protesting the palace seamstresses bespoke the goosedown for featherbeds the swansdown for trimming and the tail feathers for hats wing feathers went off to the fletchers and to be made into quill pens that left the body feathers free for the claiming so there were always bags full of them for anyone who cared to take wornout clothing and other scrap material to make a patchwork cushion or two skif now had nearly twenty piled up behind him and for those whose pockets ran to more than the stipend some of the more toplofty of the blues hed wagered against such things as a plush coverlet a map to hang on his wall so that he wouldnt need to be always running up to the library and oddly enough books the plush coverlet was folded up and waiting for winter to go on his bed the map made a dark rectangle on one whitewashed wall and the bookcase the bookcase was no longer empty hed never disliked reading but hed also never had a lot of choice about what he read it had never occurred to him that there might be other things to read than religious texts and dry histories then he discovered tales poetry books written to be read for pleasure it wasnt the overwhelming addiction for him that it was with some of the trainees who would have had their nose in a book every free moment if they could but for him reading was as satisfying as a good meal in his opinion and a book made a very very useful thing to demand on a wager it made him look a great deal more harmless in the eyes of those highborn blues so now his bookshelves held two kinds of books his schoolbooks and the growing collection of books he could open at any time to lose himself in some distant place or time and the room now had personality that it hadnt shown before but that was not what he wanted to think about it was what had happened at that reception tonight the whole thing had been good in that it proved weaponsmaster alberich had every intention of using him but it hadnt gotten them any results and what could be done within the wall around the palace wasnt anything near enough and he knew that alberich knew that it wasnt enough one end of the trail might be here but the other was down near exiles gate here there was likely only one person the man behind it all there well there were a lot of people there had to be and plenty of em with loose tongues if you could catch em right or get enough liquor into em now alberich could go down there fit in and be talked to hed already proved that but the question was not whether hed be talked to the question was who would talk to him jass had spoken to him sold him information and now jass was dead had anyone made that connection skif didnt know and it was certainsure that no one was going to tell alberich if they had take it farther if alberich pressed too hard and in the wrong direction someone might decide he was too dangerous to let alone now old alberich wasnt very like to get himself in serious trouble not with kantor to come rescue him at need but if a white horse came charging into exiles gate and carrying off a fellow who was hardpressed in a fight there werent too many folks down there that couldnt put two and two together and come up with the right number there was that but there was more the kinds of people that alberich would talk to were the bullyboys other sellswords if he was lucky possibly the tavernkeepers would talk to him they wouldnt necessarily have the information he needed there was however another set of people who might the whores the pawnbrokers the people who bought and sold stolen goods they all knew skif and they knew things that the folks who practiced their trades in a more open fashion might not come to that skif knew a few of the other thieves who might trade a word or two with him you never knew what you were going to find yourself in possession of when you were a thief it might could be that one of them would have run across something to put skif on the trail particularly intriguing was that thread of information that alberich had let fall how the trade in children stolen off the streets and the trade in slaves taken by bandits might be linked it made a certain amount of sense that if you assumed that the slavers were all working together skif hummed to himself tunelessly as he considered that who would know if anyone did there were always rumors but who would be able to give the scrap of foundation to the rumor one by one he ran down the list of his acquaintances those who had always seemed to know where to start when you were looking for someone or something most particularly those who had pointed him on the trail of jass and he dragged out all of the tag bits of information hed been given that hadnt led him to jass but into other paths that had seemed at the time like dead ends at the moment he couldnt imagine anything more bizarre than that he reclining at his ease in his own room of a wing attached to the palace itself should be running down the lists of those who owed him favors and those whose cooperation could be bought in the most miserable quarter of haven nevertheless alberich does it all the time so i aint the only one none of the things hed been told seemed to lead him to child stealing nor could he think of anyone he knew likely to really know anything other than just rumors reluctantly he found himself thinking that if there was one black blot in the alleyways of exiles gate that might hide part of the answer it was his own uncle londer londer galko always skirted the fringe of the quasilegal londer was not brave enough to dare the darkest deeds himself but skif could tell even as a child that he yearned to the older londer got the less he dared but the more he yearned bazie had hinted more than once that londer would have sold skif in a heartbeat if skif hadnt already been registered on the city rolls and even then if he could have manufactured a believable story about skif running away skif was not at all surprised now that halfwitted maisie had been illegally underage perhaps not for the employment at the hollybush but certainly for the uses that his cousin kalchan had made of her she hadnt looked underaged what there was of her was womansized but londer had to have known skif wouldnt be surprised now to learn that londer himself had sampled maisies meager charms before passing her on to his son londer had never given his sons anything he hadnt already used beel being the exception but then the idea of londer attempting the life of a priest was enough to make a cat laugh and londer didnt exactly have women lining up to keep him company in the years since running off skif had learned a lot about his uncle and hed learned that when it came to women londer had to pay for what he got since hed already paid for maisie it followed that hed probably seen no reason why he shouldnt have her first not that hed shown any interest in anything too young to have breasts but halfwits often matured early and londer probably wouldnt even think twice about her real age if hed taken her londer had morethandubious friends too even by the standards of exiles gate and after the raid on the hollybush well hed lost what few friends he had around there not only because of maisie but because he had laid all the blame on his own son and left him to rot and eventually die in gaol kalchan had never recovered enough even to do the idiots work of stone picking and londer had done nothing to help him recover business was business but blood was blood and people didnt much care for a man who disclaimed responsibility for things that people knew he was responsible for because his unconscious son couldnt refute them a good thing for londer that his son never did wake to full sense and died within three moons the case against londer died with him and skif could only wonder who londer was friendly with now given how many people that callousness had offended or had that just freed his uncle to edge a little nearer to those dark deeds he secretly admired given all of that londer probably didnt engage in child snatching for his own puerile entertainment but that didnt mean he didnt help it along just because he got a thrill out of doing so he probably had been frightened enough by his brush with the law not to do anything so dangerous for his own profit either but it was increasingly likely in skifs estimation that he knew something about it the hollybush hadnt by any means been londers only property he owned warehouses in places where there wasnt anyone around to notice odd things going on at night so a very good place to start would be with his uncle skif knew the ins and outs of londers house for more than once hed contemplated getting some of what he considered that he was owed out of his uncle hed eventually given up on the idea for the fact was that anything londer had of value was generally too big to be carried off easily but because of that skif knew the house and he knew the twisty ways of londers mind almost as well as he knew the house the best way to get information out of him would be to frighten it out londer was good at keeping his mouth shut but not when he was startled and not when he was genuinely frightened so skif set himself to figuring out exactly how he could best terrify his uncle into telling skif everything he might know or guess about the child stealing and the slavery ring in his bed in the dead of night skif decided skif was short even for a boy his age but a shadowy figure dressed in black waking you up with a knife to your throat was likely to seem a whole lot bigger than he actually was and a hoarse whisper didnt betray that he was too young for his voice to have broken yet alberich had brought the allblack nightwalking suit when hed collected skifs clothing skif knew a way into londers house that not even londer knew about good old londer every window had a lock every door had two but he forgot completely about the trapdoor onto the roof all skif had to do was get into the yard and shinny up the drainpipe from the gutters once on the roof he was as good as inside right enough if londer knew anything skif would have it out of him but he needed a suitably convincing story for his blackclad terrorist to ask the questions he needed the answers to ill say im lookin for msister he decided thats a good story an londerll probably believe it now getting from here to there hed be able to get out of his room easily enough no one checked beds to see that people were in them around here the trouble was how was he to get out of and more importantly back inside the palace walls me of course cymry replied in his head he jumped then smiled sheepishly nobody is going to stop a companion and her chosen you dont mind he asked hesitantly after all this wasnt precisely going to be a sanctioned excursion mind he felt her scorn you just try and do it without me you wouldnt have a chance well she was probably right but what do i do with you while im sneakin around he asked she chuckled ill take care of that trust me lean always insinuate myself into someones nearby stable but im not having you so far away that i cant come to your rescue if i have to he was both touched and a trifle irritated did she think he couldnt take care of himself hed been taking care of himself for the past year and more she hadnt been around then now she sounded contrite of course you can take care of yourself i never doubted that but your uncle might have guards he laughed silently londer old cheap londer not a chance what he has got is dogs but hes too cheap to get trained ones so he just gets nasty ones and keeps em hungry to keep em mean which means cymry knew bless her she got it at once theyll eat anything you throw in front of them he grinned and i know where to get plenty of poppy syrup put em right to sleep inside a candlemark then i slip inside and give old uncle a surprise then what will you do she asked soberly when you leave you arent im gonna make him drink poppy hisself skif reassured her no way im taking a chance on hitting him hard enough to make sure he stays knocked out besides with that thick head of his id probably break what i hit him with before i knocked him out he felt her sigh gustily good then this will all work and what then then he closed his eyes but couldnt yet see a direction for himself its early days to make any plans ill figure on what to do after i hear what old londer has to say and that would have to do for now skif looked down on the silent darkened oblong that was his uncles yard from the roof of his uncles house the rooftree was not the most comfortable place hed ever had to perch but better to rest here than inside the house down there somewhere in the shadows were five lumps of sleeping canine that had been completely unable to resist juicy patties of chopped meat mixed with bread crumbs soaked in poppy syrup poor miserable animals uncle londer would probably be even harsher with them after their failure to stop him this was the halfway point and skif paused for a breather while he could take one hed gotten out of the collegium through his window out of the complex openly on cymrys back as if he was going out into the city for any perfectly ordinary reason well perhaps not ordinary since trainees as young as he was generally didnt go out to the city after dark but hed made sure to look serious as if someone had sent for him rather than overly cheerful as if he expected to find himself in say the virgin and stars tavern that night no one questioned him and heraldic trainees unlike the commonborn blues or the bardic trainees were not required to give a reason for leaving the complex at whatever hour probably because it was generally assumed that their companions would not agree to anything that wasnt proper once in haven cymry found an unguarded stable near uncle londers house unguarded because it was completely empty and beginning to fall to pieces symptom of a sudden change in someones fortune there he had changed into his black clothing feeling distinctly odd as he did so it seemed that the last time hed worn this was a lifetime ago not just a couple of moons but where he was going that uniform was a distinct handicap he hadnt swathed his face and head or blackened exposed flesh with charcoal just then hed still had to get the chopped meat the bread and the poppy syrup and not all in the same market square just so no one would put him and the ingredients together if they were questioned later that was why hed left the collegium early markets stayed open late in the poorer parts of town for the benefit of those whose own working hours were long skif had no trouble in acquiring what he needed and he made his final preparations in that stable by the light of the moon overhead then and only then did he finish dressing and with the treated meat stuffed into cleaned sausage bladders which he tied off and then put into a bag he had slipped out alone into the darkness the key to making sure that all five dogs got their doses was to send the bladders over the wall at long intervals the first and strongest dog wolfed down his portion then staggered about for a bit and fell asleep when skif heard the staggering he sent over the second bladder by that time the strongest dog was in no condition to contest the food and the second strongest got it it took a while but skif was patient and when he couldnt hear anything other than dog snores he went over the wall and up the gutter to the roof now he sat on the rooftree with his back against one of the chimneys using its bulk to conceal his silhouette and took deep slow breaths to calm himself his gut was a tight knot a good reason for not eating much tonight and he was thirsty but thirsty was better than being in the middle of a job and having to well this would be the first time he had ever entered a house with the intention of confronting someone normally that was the last thing he wanted to do and it had him strung tighter than an illtuned harp so he ran over what he needed to do in his mind until he thought hed rehearsed it enough and mindcalled cymry im going in he told her you know what to do if you get in trouble she replied for they had already worked that out skif would get outside anywhere outside and she would come for him she swore she could even get into the yard if it was needful how she was to get over that fence he had no notion but that was her problem bazie had taught him that once you put your confidence in a partner you just trusted that he knew what he was doing and went on with your part of the plan because once the plan was in motion there was nothing you could do about what he was responsible for anyway so there was no point in taking up some of the attention you should be paying to your part of the job by worrying about him he slipped over the rooftree to the next chimney the hatch into the crawl space was just on the other side of it it wasnt locked it hadnt been locked for the past five years that skif knew of even if it had been it was one of those that had its hinges on the outside and all he would have had to do would have been to knock the hinge pins out and he could have lifted it up from the hinge side he left it open just in case he had to make a quick exit and couldnt use the route out hed planned the space he slipped down into was more of a crawl space than an attic too small to be practical to store anything he crawled on his hands and knees feeling his way along until he came to the hatch that led down into the hallway separating all of the dozen garret rooms where londers servants slept six on one side of the corridor and six on the other well where the servants londer had would have slept if hed had more than the three he kept like everything else londer had his servants were cheap because no one else would have them and he worked them screaming and cursing at them all the while until they dropped his manofallwork was a drunkard so was his cook and the overworked housemaid was another halfwit like maisie none of them was going to wake up short of skif falling on them which obviously he didnt intend to do not that he was going to take any chances about it he found the hatch which had a cover meant to be pushed up and aside from the hallway below he lifted it up and put it out of the way then stuck his head down into the hall and took a quick look around as hed expected it was deserted not so dark as the crawl space thanks to a tiny window on either end of the hall and silent but for three sets of snoring he actually had to stop and listen in fascination for a moment for hed never heard anything like it there was a deep basso rumbling which was probably the handyman whose pattern was a long drawn out sound interrupted by three short snorks layered atop this was a second set vaguely alto in pitch of short loud snorts in a rising tone that sounded like an entire sty full of pigs and atop that was a soprano solo with snoring on the intake of breath and whistling on the exhalation one was the housemaid and the other the cook but which was which the housemaid was younger but fatter than the cook so either could have had the soprano all three were so loud that he could not imagine how they managed not to wake themselves up it took everything he had to keep from laughing out loud and he wished devoutly that he dared describe this to one of the bardic trainees theyd have hysterics at least now he knew for certain that the last thing he needed to worry about was making a noise up here he grabbed the edge of the hatch and somersaulted over slowly and deliberately lowering himself down by the strength of his arms alone until his arms were extended fulllength his feet still dangled above the floor so he waited for the moment when the chorus of snores overlapped and let go hoping the noise would cover the sound of his fall he landed with flexed knees caught his balance bent over with his knuckles just touching the floor and froze waiting to see if there would be a reaction not a sound to indicate that anyone had heard him heh not gonna be hard figuring which rooms are empty that had been a serious concern he needed to find an empty room with a window get into it get the window unlocked and opened for his escape because now that he was inside he knew that there was no way he was going to get out the way he came in if there had been a ladder to let down from the crawl space that would have been ideal but there wasnt by great good fortune the room nearest the drainpipe he wanted to use was one of the empty ones no thief could survive long who wasnt able to tell where he was inside a house in relation to the outside without ever being inside out of the breast of his tunic came one of his trusty bladders of oil and he oiled the hinges to the dripping point by feel before he even tried to open the door there was a faint creak but it was entirely smothered in snores the door opened onto a completely barren room not a stick of furniture in it moonlight shone in through the dirty window finally giving him something to see by after the absolute dark of the crawl space and the relative dark of the hallway it seemed as bright as day moving carefully with a care for creaking floorboards he eased his way over to the window and out came the oil again when catches locks and hinges were all thoroughly saturated he got the window open wide checked to make sure he could reach the drainpipe from its sill and left it that way he did however close the door to the room most of the way just in case one of the three snorers woke up and felt impelled to take a stroll they were too dimwitted to think of an intruder but they might take it into their heads to close the window which would slow his retreat the servants stair lay at the end of the hallway and it was just the narrow sort of arrangement that skif would have expected from the age of the house in this part of the city land was at a premium so as little space as possible within a home was wasted on servants amenities but fortunately whoever had built this stair had done so with an eye to silence in his servants and had built it so sturdily that it probably wouldnt creak if a horse went down it not even londers neglect could undo work that solid not in the few years that londer had owned the house anyway down the stairs went skif and now he had to go on the memories of a very small child augmented by as much study of the house from outside as he had been able to manage londers bedroom as he recalled and as study of the house seemed to indicate was on the next floor down overlooking the street a curious choice given that street noise was going to be something of a disturbance and would certainly be obtrusive early in the morning but londer wanted to see who was at his door before they were announced and the other choice of master bedroom was over the kitchen and under the servants rooms altogether a poor choice for someone who probably knew all about the snorers chorus and didnt want it resonating down into his bedroom nor would he want the aromas of the cooks latest accident permeating his bedroom and lingering in the hangings he stifled another laugh as he felt his way down the stair tread by tread he could only wonder what londer had thought when he discovered the amazing snoring powers of all three of his servants this stair should come out beside the room just over the kitchen that londer used for his guests important guests of course not people like his sister and her young son theyd lived in one of the garret rooms though skif couldnt remember which one since they hadnt lived there for long when he reached the landing once again he stopped and listened aside from the now faint chorus from snore hall above there was nothing he took a precautionary sniff of the air for a room that was occupied had a much different scent than one that had been shut up for a while if uncle had a guest that skif didnt know about the guest became an unforeseen complication a possible source of interference but the scent that came to his nose was of a room that had lain unused for a very long time a touch of mildew a great deal of dust and when he emerged from the stair he found himself as he had reckoned in the dressing room to that unused guest suite the dressing room led directly to the corridor and probably the reason that the stair came out into it at all was the very sensible one of convenience for the original master and builder of the house who probably would have chosen this suite for himself water for baths would come straight up the stair from the kitchen in cans to be poured into the bath in the dressing room if the master was hungry and rang for service his snack would be brought up in moments freshly prepared this corridor was short it ran between the old master suite to two other sets of rooms it extended the width of the house and had a window on either end with the staircase leading downward for the familys use on skifs right three doors let out on it besides the one that skif stood in the one on skifs side led to a second bedroom separate from the master suite probably intended for a superior personal maid or manservant the two opposite were probably for guests or children in the original plan one was now londers and heaven only knew what he did with the other skif put his ear to the door nearest him on that side it was definitely occupied although the slumberer was no match for the trio upstairs just to be sure skif eased down the corridor and checked the other silent and as turning the door handle proved locked as well he returned to londers room took a steadying breath and took out another bladder of oil because he did not want londer to wake up until skifs knife was at his throat only when the hinges were saturated did skif ease the door open wincing at the odor that rolled out well the old man hasnt changed his bathing habits any after the cleanliness of bazies room the priory and the collegium skifs nose wrinkled at the effluvia of unwashed clothing unwashed sheets unwashed body rancid sweat and bad breath it wasnt bad enough to gag a goat but it was close if this wasnt so important id leave now it made his skin crawl to think of getting so close to that foul stench but he didnt have much choice londer had his windows open to the night air so at least he could see and at least he wasnt going to smother in the stink he took a deep breath this time of cleaner air and slipped inside londer didnt wake until the edge of the knife the dull edge did he but know it was against his throat skif had tried to time his entry for when the moon was casting the most light on the streetward side of the house in fact moonlight streamed in through the windows and skif could tell from the sheer terror on londers face that he was having no trouble seeing what there was to see of skif dont move skif hissed and dont shout i wont londer whimpered what dyou want from me londer shivered with fear skif had never seen anyone actually doing that and to see londers fat jowls shaking like a jelly induced a profound disgust in him you can start hissed skif by telling me what you did with my sister londer looked as if he was going to have a fit right there and then and skif thought he might have hit gold but it turned out that londer had just gotten rough with one of his paid women and he thought that skif was her brother not but that skif was averse to seeing him terrified over it but that wasnt the street he wanted to hound his uncle down so he quickly established that the apocryphal sister was one of the children snatched off the streets and the interview continued on that basis skif must have looked and sounded twice as intimidating as he thought because londer was reduced in very short order to a blubbering mound of terror and tears skif would have been very glad to have the heraldic truth spell at his disposal but he figured that fear was getting almost as much truth out of londer as the spell would have unfortunately there was very little to get londer knew some of what was going on as skif had thought he knew some of the men who were doing the actual snatches what their method was for picking a victim how they managed it without raising too much fuss and where they went with the victims afterward which as skif had guessed was one of loaders own warehouses but who the real powers behind the snatches were he had no idea his knowledge was all at street level even the warehouse had been hired by a gobetween which was disgusting enough londer whimpered and carried on literally sweating buckets trying to make out that the poor younglings grabbed by the gang were better off than theyd be on the street sheltered and fed maybe but better off if they were incredibly lucky and not at all attractive theyd find themselves working from dawn to dusk at some skinflints farm or knotting rugs sewing shirts making rope or any one of a hundred tasks that needed hands but not much strength if they were pretty well that was something skif didnt want to think about too hard there had been a childbrothel four streets over from the hollybush that had been shut down when he was still with bazie there were things that even the denizens of exiles gate wouldnt put up with but where there was one there were probably more the only reason why this one had been uncovered was because someone had been careless or someone had snitched but by far and away the single most important piece of information that skif got was that the man who was in charge of the entire ring always came to inspect the children when they were brought to the warehouse it seemed he didnt trust the judgment of his underlings if there was ever to be a time to catch him that would be it when skif had gotten everything he thought he could out of londer he took the knife away from the mans throat londer started to babble an abrupt gesture with the knife shut him up again and skif thrust a bottle made from a small gourd at him drink it he ordered londers eyes bulged ywouldnt poison me oh get shut skif snapped exasperated id be shamed to count ye as a kill tis poppy fool ive got no time t tie ye up an gag ye even if i could stummack touchin ye now drink londer pulled the cork with his teeth and sucked down the contents of the bottle skif made him open his mouth wide to be sure he actually had swallowed it and wasnt holding it then he sat back and waited knowing that it was going to take longer for the drug to take effect on the man because of londers fear counteracting it meanwhile his uncle just stared at him occasionally venturing a timid question that skif did not deign to answer if he really was someone out to discover the whereabouts of a young sister hed spend no more time on londer than he had to and tempting as it was to pay back everything he owed londer in the way of misery such torment would not have been in keeping with his assumed role and it might give londer a clue to his real identity so he stayed quiet focusing what he hoped was a menacing gaze on the man until at long long last londers eyelids drooped and dropped his trembling stopped all his muscles went slack and the drug took him over only then did skif leave the room taking the bottle with him his exit via the garret room and the drainpipe was uneventful as was his exchange of clothing in the stable and his escape from that part of town it almost seemed as if there was a good spirit watching over him and smoothing his way he said as much to cymry once they were up in among the mansions of the great and powerful i wish youd gotten more information then she replied ruefully i hate to think that much good luck was wasted on essentially trivial knowledge not as trivial as ymight think he replied thoughtfully for a new plan was beginning to take shape in his mind it was a plan that was fraught with risk but it might be worth it and he was not going to carry out this one alone out late arent you trainee said a voice at his stirrup startling him he looked down to discover that cymry had brought him to the little gate in the palace walls used by all the trainees on legitimate business and the gate guard was looking up at him with a hint of suspicion tell him the truth loon cymry prompted as he tried to think of something to say he hadnt expected that cymry would try to take them in the same way theyd gone out i had tsee my uncle in haven he said truthfully he didnt think he was gonna live there was summat i needed thear from him very good he really didnt think youd leave him alive did he the guards demeanor went from suspicious to sympathetic i hope his fears werent justified skif stopped himself from snorting i think he was more scared than anything else he replied when i left he was sleepin off a dose of poppy and i bet hell be fine in the morning lovely absolute truth all of it evidently the guard either had relatives who were overly convinced of their own mortality or knew people who were because he laughed oh aye i understand well im sorry youre going to have your sleep cut short breakfast bell is going to ring mighty early for you skif groaned dont remind me he said as the guard waved him through without even taking his name good night to you he unsaddled cymry and turned her loose and slipped into his room again via the window thus avoiding any potentially awkward questions in the hall hed had the wit to clean himself up thoroughly at that stable so at least he needed to do nothing more than strip himself down and drop into bed which he did knowing all too well just how right that guard had been tomorrow though he had to arrange an interview with the weaponsmaster the sooner the better all during his classes the next day he had only half his mind on what was going on the other half was engaged in putting together his plan and as importantly his argument herald alberich wasnt going to like this plan it was going to be very dangerous for skif and skif knew for certain that alberich would object to that during weapons class skif managed to give alberich an unspoken signal that he hoped would clue alberich to the fact that he needed to talk privately either he was very quick on the uptake or else cymry had some inkling of what was going on inside skifs head and put the word in to alberichs kantor in either case just as class ended alberich looked straight at skif and said you will be at my quarters here at the salle after the dinner hour the others in the class completely misconstrued the order as they were probably intended to so as they all left for their next class they commiserated with him assuming that something he had done or not done well enough was going to earn him a lecture i know what it is its that you dragged yourself through practice whatever you were doing last night to keep you up you shouldnt have been kris said forthrightly youve got rings like a ferret under your eyes if you thought he wasnt going to notice that youre crazed hell probably give you a lecture about it is all opined coroc i suppose skif said and sighed heavily in actuality he really wasnt that tired although he expected to be after dinner that was probably when it would all catch up with him whatever it was it cant have been worth one of alberichs lectures kris said flatly skif just yawned and hung his head to feign sheepishness that he in no way felt his next class was no class at all it was a session in the sewing room where he couldnt stop yawning over his work the other boys in his classes had twitted him about his selfchosen assignment on the chore roster until he pointed out that he was the only boy in a room full of girls theyd gotten very quiet then and thoughtful and stopped teasing him today he was very glad that this was his chore because the girls were far more sympathetic about his yawns and darkcircled eyes than the boys had been not that they let him off any but they did keep him plied with cold tea to keep him awake and they did make sure he got the best stool for the purpose one that was comfortable but not so comfortable that he was going to fall asleep a quick wash in cold water while the rest of them were having hot baths woke him up very nicely and he hurried through his dinner now as much anxious as eager alberich wouldnt like the plan but would he go along with it anyway it was probably his duty to forbid skif even to think about carrying it out even though it was the best and fastest way to get the man they were both after well alberich could forbid him but that wouldnt stop him he just wouldnt use that plan hed come up with something else so as he walked quickly across the lawn with the light of early evening pouring golden across the grass he steeled himself to the notion that alberich would not only not like the plan but would put all the resources of the collegium behind making sure skif didnt try it alone well i wont i dunno what ill do but i cant do that one alone so there tis he didnt need cymry warning him against it the entire plan depended on having someone else by necessity a herald or trainee standing by there was not one single trainee that skif would dare even bring down to exiles gate quarter in the daytime much less at night so it would have to be a herald and the only one likely to agree to this would be alberich which brought him right around to crux of the matter again he entered the salle and went to the back of it where one of the mirrors concealed the door to alberichs other set of quarters it was no secret that they were there but it wasnt widely bruited about either maybe the concealed door was older than alberich who knew skif could think of a lot of reasons why hidden rooms might come in handy he tapped on the wall beside the mirror and it swung open as alberich pushed on the door from within he stepped inside alberich closed the door behind him and brought him through a small room that served him as an office and contained only a desk and a chair on the other side of a doorway to the left were the private quarters a suite that began with a rather austere room that contained only two chairs a ceramictiled wood stove and a large bookcase alberich gestured to the nearest chair the sole aspect of the room that wasnt austere was the huge window along one wall made up of many small panes of colored glass leaded together forming a pattern of blues and golds that looked something like a mans face and something like a suninglory it looked as though it faced east so it wasnt at its best just glowing softly most of the rooms illumination came from lanterns alberich had already lit skif made a note to himself to nip around to the back of the salle some time after dark with lanterns behind it the window must be nearly as impressive as it would be from within the room in early morning but alberich didnt give skif a chance to contemplate the window though since his chair had him facing away from it a pity hed have liked to just sit there and study it for a time someone had told him that the palace chapel had several windows like this as did the major temples in haven but this was the first time hed seen one close up the weaponsmaster barely waited for him to settle himself so your little excursion into the city last night bore some fruit was alberichs question good hes already gotten everything from cymry and kantor and maybe the guard but the who and maybe the why that was a bit less explanation hed have to give i visited muncle londer galko skif said then smiled though he didnt know twas me went masked and in over roof you know i scared him pretty thorough good enough i figger he told me the truth as well alberich should know since hed been the one who brought skifs things from his old room and had probably examined every bit skif experienced in that moment a very very odd sensation of comfort it was a relief to be able to sit here and be able to be himself completely it was like being with cymry only a more worldly sort of cymry that was wise alberich leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees and looked thoughtful i would not have thought of londer galko as a source of information for our needs i didn either till i stopped lookin for a man what needed a building burned and started thinkin about what i picked up while i was lookin for him skif replied an put that with what you tol me about the slavers theres summat snatchin younglings off the streets not many just the ones that haveta sleep there more of em than you thought i bet you dont hear bout it cause they aint the kind thatd be missed we hear more than you might think alberich put in but also nodded although if this is true we are not hearing of most of them go on londer aint the kind tget his fingers where they might get burned not after that mess with th hollybush but if theres somethin dirty goin on he probably knows summat about it he likes bein on the edge of it not so close he gets hurt close enough he can kind of gloat over it so i paid im a visit skif launched into a full explanation frankly describing everything he had done last night leaving nothing out he hadnt after all done anything that hed been forbidden nobody had put a curfew on the trainees no one had told him not to leave the collegium grounds he hadnt stolen anything all hed done was to terrorize one filthy old man whod been the cause of plenty of misery himself over the past several years still alberich didnt look disgusted and he didnt look annoyed but skif got a distinct impression that he was poised between being amused and being angry you he said at length leaning back in his chair and pointing a finger at skif are the sort who would find a way around any order so i shall not give you one this information interesting is useful possibly but if i was to go out all ragged an kip down on thstreet where i know theys been snatching skif asked while you kept a watch itd be moren useful im thinkin we got what we need for the makings of a nice little trap an its one you cant set without a youngling for bait he stabbed his thumb at his chest me you darent use anyone else alberichs face went very very still if you did not mindspeak with cymry he said very slowly but i do an you got kantor so tween them we can mindspeak each other an i got some ideas thatll keep me from gettin coshed cause i know how they been workin skif replied and sat back himself youll know when i get took an you can follow youll know when th man hisself shows up we can do moren figger out who he is we can catch im it is very dangerous you could be hurt alberich pointed out immediately you can attempt to protect yourself but that does not mean you will succeed then i get hurt skif dismissed feeling his jaw tense and his own resolve harden itll be worth it alberich halfclosed his eyes and laced his fingers together occasionally looking up at skif as though testing his mettle if this long wait was supposed to test his patience as well it wasnt going to work that way for the longer alberich thought the better skif reckoned his odds to be and when at last alberich spoke he knew hed been right very well the weaponsmaster said let me hear the whole of this plan of yours i believe that you and i must do this thing skif widened his eyes pleadingly and held out his bowl to anyone who even glanced at him he certainly looked the part of a beggar boy he hadnt worn rags like these since hed been living at the hollybush it was a good thing that it was still very warm at night or hed be freezing in the things they were more hole than cloth and he couldnt imagine where alberich had found them couldnt imagine why anyone in the collegium would have kept them at least they were clean his need for authenticity didnt run to dirt and lice and fortunately neither did alberichs a little soot smeared across his forehead chin and cheekbones provided the illusion of dirt and that was all that was required this time the place where skifs transformation had taken place had been supplied by alberich not that skif was surprised at the weaponsmasters resources alberich couldnt have walked out of the complex in his sellsword gear after all alberich brought him to an inn where a herald and a trainee could ride into the stable yard unremarked no surprises there the innkeeper greeted him by name and they took cymry and kantor to the stable to special looseboxes without doors then came the surprise in the form of a locked room at the back of the stable to which alberich had the key and which contained both a trunk of disguise material and a rear entrance onto an alley a beggar boy slipped out that entrance into the shadows of dusk somewhat later and after him a disreputable sellsword whose face would be moderately familiar in the exiles gate quarter another purpose for all that soot on skifs features was to disguise them it wouldnt do for him to be recognized skif made his way quietly to exiles gate itself then as if he had come in the gate he wandered the street in his old neighborhood training his voice into a tremulous piping as he begged from the passersby mostly he got kicks and curses though once someone gave him an end of a loaf and two others offered a rind of bacon and a rind of cheese beggars here got food more often than coin though there was little enough of the former skif went a little cold when he thought about a child trying to live on such meager fare he got a drink at a public pump and wandered about some more as the streets grew darker and torches and a few lanterns were put up outside those businesses that were staying open past full dark there were streetlights but they were very few and often the oil was stolen or even the entire lamp he was ostensibly looking for a place to sleep on the street out of the way of traffic actually he knew exactly where he was going to go to sleep but he had to make a show out of it because the child snatchers were almost certainly watching him he also kept hunched over both to look more miserable and to look smaller the younger the children were the more timid they were the better the snatchers liked them and behind him going from drink stall to tavern was alberich there was great comfort in knowing that kantor says alberich is very surprised at how good you are at this a thief that gets noticed doesnt stay out of gaol long he replied though he was secretly flattered now if hed really been trying to make his way as a beggar he would never be doing it this way hed have bound up his leg to look as if hed lost it or done the same with an arm no sores though people around here would stone him into some other quarter for fear of a pox then hed stand as straight as he could and catcall the people passing by a noisy banter that was impossible to ignore hed be cheeky but funny and not insulting people liked that they liked seeing a display of bravado especially in a cripple hed be making a better go of it than this thin wistful waif he was impersonating and the child snatchers would avoid him a child like that would never tame down and would cause nothing but trouble in his persona of woeful beggar child he had a single possession that was going to make this entire ruse work a wooden begging bowl perfectly in character with what he was no one would even remark on it and it was going to keep him from being knocked unconscious because it was much deeper than the usual bowl and fit his head exactly like a helmet once he curled himself up in his chosen spot for the night and pulled his ragged hood over his head hed slip that bowl over it under the rags when the snatchers came along and gave him that tap on the head to keep him from waking up when they grabbed him hed be protected he also had weapons on his person his throwing daggers were concealed up his sleeves alberich hadnt needed to tell him to bring them having them made him feel a good deal safer although his first choice of weapon wouldnt have been one that you threw at the enemy or it wouldnt have been if he wasnt so certain of his own accuracy it was very unlikely that hed be searched these beggar children never had anything of value on them if they once had it was long snatched by those older and stronger than they were as he trudged away from the streets where people were still carrying on the minutiae of their lives and toward the warehouses and closedup workshops he felt eyes on him the back of his neck prickled the warehouse section of exiles gate was where most of the children had vanished from and he knew now with heavy certainty that the snatchers were somewhere out there watching him waiting for him to settle alberich was out there too and had taken to the same covert skulking as skifs stalkers he was hunting the hunters watching the watchers to make sure that if anything went wrong skif wouldnt be facing it alone hes seen two of them anyway reported cymry he would never ever have attempted this by himself or even with someone who didnt also have a companion the key to this entire plan was that kantor and cymry could mindspeak to each other keeping skif and alberich aware of everything that was going on the buildings here were large with long expanses of blank wall planted directly on the street you didnt want or need windows in a warehouse there werent a lot of places where a tired child could curl up to sleep but where there was a doorway that was just big enough to fit a small body or a recessed gate it was dark and it was quiet and no one was likely to come along to chivvy one off until dawn mind any number of adult beggars knew this too so the first few places skif poked his nose into were occupied and the occupants sent him off with poorlyaimed blows and liberal curses he lost his bacon rind to one of them not that he fought for it but when he did find a place it was perfect for the child snatchers and thus perfect for his purposes it was a recessed doorway a black arch in a darkened street with no one in sight in either direction he sat down on the doorstep and pretended to eat his crust and cheese rind then with a calculatedly pathetic sigh that should be audible to his stalkers he curled up with his back to the street and his rags pulled up over his head if that wasnt an invitation hed turn priest as he stirred and fidgeted trying to get comfortable he slipped his wooden bowl over his head exactly as he had planned once he had he felt a good deal safer and the back of his neck stopped prickling so much there had been the possibility that the snatchers lured by how harmless he seemed to be and the loneliness of the street would try for the grab before he curled up for the night he was glad their caution had overcome their greed gradually he stopped moving around as a child would who was settling into sleep he wouldnt find a tolerable position on this stone doorstep anyway not after hed gotten accustomed not only to a bed but to a comfortable bed spoilt thats what i am once asleep he held himself still as a matter of pride although the stone under his hip was painfully hard and his arm was getting pins and needles eventually he had to shift off of that but when he moved it was only the formless stirring that a child would make when deeply asleep he should be asleep the beggar child he was counterfeiting was in the midst of one of the better moments of its short life it had a full belly a quiet place to lie down it was neither too cold nor too hot no one was going to chase it away from this shelter until morning and if rain came it wouldnt even get too wet never having known a soft bed the stone of the doorway would be perfectly acceptable since countless feet had worn the step down in a hollow in the middle into which skifs body fit perfectly well he hadnt had to sleep on the street ever that was partly because he was smart but there was no telling how much hed accomplished was because hed been lucky mostly he liked to think it was because hed been smart though if bazie hadnt taken him in his life probably would have been a lot different harder maybe it depended on what he would have done after beel warned him away from the hollybush if hed gone back to beel hed have had to make a statement against his uncle that could have gone badly for him hed known that even when hed been that young it was the reason hed run off in the first place maybe hed have been safe in beels temple maybe not finding out which could have been bad if hed run though i think maybe id have hidden in the storage room of orthallens wash house then what he didnt know how long could he have gone on sleeping in hidden places stealing food from kitchens in the guise of a page cymry interrupted his speculations kantor says theyve all gotten together there are three of them cymry reported interrupting his thoughts she sounded indignant three of them for one little child skif wasnt surprised a pretty child or one that was strong was a valuable commodity having two to make the snatch and one to stand guard meant they could grab it with a minimum of damage to the merchandise thats so one can be a lookout in case their targets gone inside a yard or something skif told her but i have to agree even two seems kind of much for someone my size its disgusting he had to smile at the affronted quality in her words not that the whole thing isnt disgusting but i understand he told her and he did it was disgusting he could think abstractly about a child as merchandise but the minute he allowed himself to get outside of those abstractions he was disgusted skif be ready theyre moving in he heard them in the last few paces if hed really been asleep particularly if he was an exhausted child with a full belly it wouldnt have disturbed him but he heard their soft footfalls on the hardpacked dirt of the street they were cautious he gave them that but waiting for them to finally make their move was enough to drive him mad he had to grit his teeth and clench his muscles to stay put when every instinct and most of his training screamed at him to get up and defend himself then they were on him all three of them in a rush he was enveloped in a smelly blanket instinct won over control and he felt the mere beginnings of a reaction but before he could even move much less come up fighting someone hit him a precise blow to the head the bowl took most of it as hed anticipated but his head and ears still rang with it in fact for just a moment he saw stars he went limp partly with intent partly with the shock of the blow and when he could move again he regained control over himself and stayed properly limp they didnt dally about they bundled him up cocoonlike in the blanket one of the snatchers threw the bundle over his shoulder with a grunt of effort and they were off at a lope whoever had skif must have been a big man because he carried skif as if he was nothing cymry did not ask are you all right because she knew he was and what she knew alberich knew so there was no point in wasting time with silly questions when alberich needed to concentrate on following skifs captors and skif had immediate concerns of his own to deal with skif concentrated on breathing carefully in that foully smothering blanket staying limp and keeping up the ruse that he was as completely unconscious as that blow to the head should have rendered him this was the hardest part of the plan to literally do nothing while his captor carried him off and hope that alberich could keep up with them they only had to get to their goal which might or might not be londers warehouse alberich had to stay with them while remaining unseen not the easiest task in the world skif had shadowed enough people in his life to know how hard it really was hed have to get the bowl off his head too at some point in the near future or theyd figure out he wasnt what he seemed and he wasnt unconscious definitely before he got unwrapped or hed be in a far more uncomfortable position than he was now so as the man jogged along skif worked his hands a little at a time up toward his head the blanket smelled of so many things all of them horrid that he hated to think of what had happened in it and to it it wasnt so much a blanket as a heavy tarpaulin of something less scratchy than wool was it sailcloth it could be he wasnt so tightly wrapped up in it that he couldnt move hed been sleeping with his arms up against his chest so he shouldnt have too far to work them to get his hands on that bowl he was glad he hadnt eaten much since his head and torso were dangling upside down along his captors back the stench of the blanket was appalling and the mans shoulder essentially hit him in the gut with every step if there was a better recipe for nausea he didnt know it hed have been sick if he hadnt been cautious about not eating much beforehand bit by bit he worked his arms higher moving them only with the motion of the man who carried him slowly working his hands up through the canvas towards the bowl then at long last with the tips of his fingers he touched it with a sigh of relief he pushed with his fingertips and ducked his head at the same time as the man stumbled the bowl came off his head and fell off into the folds of the blanket he was rid of it and now he could not relax certainly but wait be still try to ignore the reek of the blanket and remember the next part of the plan it looks as if your uncles warehouse really is the goal cymry said he wished he could see hellfires i wish i could breathe but if londers warehouse was the goal it couldnt be very much longer alberich was supposed to have scouted the place during the day so hed be familiar with the outside at least skif just wished that the weaponsmaster was as good at roof walking as he was if only they could have switched parts dont worry about your partner if he says he can do something and youve got no cause to think otherwise then let him do his job and concentrate on yours well that was easy to say and hard to do when it all came down to cases it seemed forever before the men stopped and when they did skif was gritting his teeth so hard he thought they might splinter with the tension they knocked on the door quite softly in a pattern of three two and five got it cymry said alberich doesnt know if hes going to try going in that way but if he does that will make it easier the door creaked open got nother one said a voice in a harsh whisper with accents of surprise thas thirdun tonight pickins is good said the man to skifs right as the one carrying him grunted gotr eyes on two more prime uns so les get thisun settled bossll be right happy said the doorkeeper as the men moved forward and closed the door behind them thas thideer grunted the man with skif they moved more slowly now and to skifs dismay there was a fair amount of opening and closing of doors and direction changes down passages this place must be a veritable warren how was alberich supposed to find him in all of this if he got inside let us worry about that said cymry right before there was the sound of another door opening then the unmistakable feeling that his captor was descending a staircase descending a staircase theres a cellar to this place there isnt supposed to be a cellar here skif was in something of a panic because part of the emergency plan figured in the companions coming in as well as alberich and the companions were not going to be able to get down a narrow steep set of stairs into a cellar he had to remind himself that he was not alone he was armed and he was probably smarter than any of these people no matter what happened here sooner or later they would have to take him outside this building and when they did he could escape even if he and alberich couldnt actually catch the head of this gang of slavers right now so long as skif could get a good look at him theyd have him later whats the worst that can happen he asked himself and set himself to imagining it alberich wouldnt get in hed be held for a while maybe with other children maybe not the master of this gang would inspect them skif could make sure he saw enough he would be able to pick him out again then well the question was how attractive they found him he had to stop himself from shuddering just by virtue of being healthy and in good shape he was as pretty as most of the street urchins theyd been picking up which meant there was one place where theyd send him now the panic became real his throat closed with fear and he had trouble breathing oh no oh no in all his years on the street he had never really had to face the possibility that he might end up a childwhore now he did for if he couldnt get away from these people or they found out what he was doing his imagination painted far worse things than he had ever seen cobbled up out of all the horrible stories he had ever heard and his breath came in short and painful gasps he went from stifling to icy cold what if their the brothel was here in this building they wouldnt have to take him outside they wouldnt have to move him at all he wouldnt get a chance to escape they could keep him here as long as they wanted to they could they would strip him down first and find his knives what would they do to him then drug him maybe kill him oh no probably not that not while they could get some use out of him dont panic dont panic how could he not panic chosen we wont let that happen well get to you no matter what but how would they how could they it would take a small army to storm this place and by then the man carrying him got to the bottom of the stair and made a turning this brats awful quiet he grunted to his fellow ye sure ye didn it im too ard no moren the rest uv em the other snapped es breathin aint e aye just don wanta hevta turn over damaged goods milord dont care fer damaged goods the man hefted skif a little higher on his shoulder surprising him into an involuntary groan caused as much by desperation as by pain there ye see the second man said in triumph nothin wrong wi im es wakin up right on time les get im locked up then said the one from the door there was the sound of a key turning in a lock a heavy door swinging open then quite suddenly skif found himself being dumped unceremoniously onto something soft well softish landing knocked the breath out of him though he managed to keep from banging his head when he landed he heard the door slam and the key turn in the lock again before he got his wits back he struggled free of the stinking confines of the blanket only to find himself in the pitch dark and he was just as blind as hed been in the blanket he felt around heard rustling and felt straw under his questing hands the something soft hed been dumped on was a pile of old straw smelling of mildew and dust but infinitely preferable to the stench of the blanket he got untangled from the folds of that foul blanket wadded it up and with a convulsive movement flung it as far away from himself as possible the wooden bowl that had saved his skull from being cracked clattered down out of the folds of it as it flew across the room which wasnt far after all he heard it hit a wall immediately his prison was a prison then and a small one he got onto his hands and knees and began feeling his way to the nearest wall rough brick met his hands so cheap it was crumbling under his questing fingers a symptom of the damp getting into it he got to his feet and followed it until it intersected the next wall and the next and the next and then came to the door a few moments more of exploring by touch proved that this wasnt a room it was a cell it couldnt have been more than three arms lengths wide and twice that in length not a very wellconstructed cell though rough brick made up the walls and the floor was nothing more than pounded dirt with the straw atop it and when skif got to the door he finally felt some of his fear ebbing the lock on this door had never been designed with the idea of confining a thief he could probably have picked it in the pitchdark with a pry bar the throwing daggers he wore were fine enough to work through the hole in the back plate and trip the mechanism i can get out that was all it took to calm him these people never intended to have to hold more than a few frightened children down here as long as they thought that was what he was hed be fine if this was their child brothel he could get out of it or you can jam the lock and keep them out until we get in cymry pointed out and he nearly laughed aloud at what a simple and elegant solution she had found for him yes he could he could then help could take as long as it needed to reach him even if they set fire to the warehouse to cover their tracks he should be safe down here he remembered once when one of the taverns had caught fire how half a dozen of the patrons had hidden in the cellars and come out covered in soot but safe and drunk out of their minds for theyd been trapped by falling timbers and had decided they might as well help themselves to the stock will you be all right now cymry asked anxiously right and tight he told her and he would be he would he had to be everything depended on him now he would be he heard the men enter and leave again twice more and each time a door creaked open somewhere and he heard the thump of some small load landing in straw he winced each time for the sake of the poor semiconscious child that it represented between the first and the second cymry told him that alberich had gotten into the building but could tell him nothing more than that it was not long after that the men arrived with the second child and soon after that when the cellars awoke there was noise first voices harsh and quarrelsome then came heavy footsteps and then light so much light that it shone under skifs door and through all the cracks between the heavy planks that the door was made up of then the door was wrenched open and a huge man stood silhouetted against the glare skif didnt have to pretend to fear he shrank back with a start throwing up his arm to shield his eyes the man took a pace toward him and skif remembered his knives remembered that he didnt dare let anyone grab him by the arm lest they be discovered he scrambled backward until he reached the wall then with his back pressed into the brick got to his feet huddling his arms around his chest the man grabbed him by the collar his arms and hands not being easy to grab in that position and hauled him out into the corridor and down it toward an opening the corridor wasnt very long and there were evidently only six of the little brick cells in it three on each side it deadended to skifs rear in a wall of the same rough brick the man dragged skif toward the open end then threw him unceremoniously into the larger room beyond a large and echoing chamber that was empty of furnishings and lit by lanterns hung from hooks depending from the ceiling skif landed beside three more children all girls all shivering and speechless with fear tearstreaked faces masks of terror facing them were five men four heavily armed standing in pairs on either side of the fifth was this the hopedfor mastermind behind all of this eres th last on em milord said the man whod brought skif out the fust two ye said werent good fer yer gennelmen this a good nuff offerin skif looked up from his fellow captives for a moment he couldnt see the mans face but he knew the voice right enough very nice purred the man with just an edge of contempt beneath the approval prime stock yes theyll do theyll do very nicely it was the same voice that had spoken with jass in the tomb in the cemetery and when milord came into the light skif stared at him not in recognition but to make sure he knew the face later if this man was one of those that had attended lord orthallens reception skif didnt recall him but then he had a very ordinary face what bazie would have called a faceshaped face with that laugh of his neither this nor that neither round nor oblong nor square nondescript in every way brown hair brown eyes he could have been anyone the man was wearing very expensive clothing in quite excellent taste that was something of a surprise skif would have expected excellent clothing in appalling taste given the circumstances milord well the clothing was up to the standards of the highborn but something about him didnt fit since being at the collegium skif had met a fair number of highborn and there was an air about them as if everyone they met would as a matter of course assume they were superior so it was second nature to them and they didnt have to think about it this man wore his air of superiority and his pride openly like a cloak so what exactly was he he had money he had power but he just didnt fit the merchant mold either yet he must have influence and someone must be feeding him information or he never would have been able to continue to operate as successfully and invisibly as he had until now the man gestured and one of the four men with him grabbed the shoulder of the girl he pointed at hauling her to her feet she couldnt have been more than eight or nine at most thin and wan and frightened into paralysis the man walked around her surveying her from every angle he took her chin in his hand roughly tilting her face up even prying open her mouth to look at her teeth as tears ran soundlessly down her smudged cheeks leaving tracks in the dirt he didnt order her to be stripped but then given that she wasnt wearing much more than a tattered feed sack with a string around it he didnt really need to yes the man said after contemplating her for long moments during which she shivered like an aspen in the wind she was a very pretty little thing under all her dirt and skifs heart ached for her hadnt her life been bad enough without this descent into nightmare how could a tiny little child possibly deserve this and this was the man who had ordered the deaths of bazie and the two boys with no more concern than if he had crushed a beetle beneath his foot this man with his faceshaped face this was the face of true evil that concealed itself in blandness no monster here just a man who could have hidden himself in any crowd he would probably pat his friends children genially on the head even give them little treats this man who assessed the market value of a little girl and consigned her to a fearful fate he was valued by his neighbors no doubt this beast in a mans skin skif hated him hated the look of him the sound of his voice hated everything about him hated most of all that he could smile and smile and look so like any other man yes the man said again with a bland smile the same smile a housewife might use when finding a particularly fat goose pretty and pliant this one will be very profitable for us oh it is that i think not good guildmaster said a highly accented voice from the doorway skifs heart leaped and when alberich himself walked through the door sword and dagger at the ready it was all he could do to keep from cheering aloud there was a moment of absolute silence as even the guildmasters professional bodyguards were taken by surprise but that moment ended almost as soon as it began the man whod brought skif out bolted for the door behind the guildmaster disappearing into the darkness all four of the bodyguards charged alberich as the guildmaster himself stood back with a smirk that would have maddened skif if he hadnt been scrambling to get out of the way he pushed the three little girls ahead of him into the partial shelter of the wall and stood between them and the fighting not that he was going to be able to do anything other than try and push them somewhere else if the fighting rolled over them not that he was going to be able to do anything to help alberich he knew when he was outweighed outweaponed and outclassed this fight was no place for an undersized and halftrained at best adolescent besides alberich didnt look as if he needed any help at least not at the moment the weaponsmaster had been impressive enough in the salle and on the training ground here literally surrounded by four skilled fighters skif could hardly believe what he was seeing alberich moved like a demon incarnate and so quickly that half the time skif couldnt see what had happened only that hed somehow eluded what should have killed him still four to one maybe hed better do something to try and drop the odds skif slipped the catches on his knives and then hesitated the combatants were all moving too fast and in unpredictable ways hed never practiced against anything but a stationary target if he threw a knife he could all too easily hit alberich and if he threw a knife hed also throw away half of his own defenses skif get the children out now cymrys mental shout woke him out of his indecision with a quick glance to make sure the guildmaster what guild was he was too far away to interfere skif grabbed the wrists of two of the three the third was clinging to the arm of the second and pulled them onto their feet then he got behind them and slowly trying not to attract the eye of their chiefest captor he herded them in front of him along the wall and toward the door that alberich had entered by one of the three at least woke out of her fear to see what he was trying to do she seized the wrists of both of the others and dragged them with her as they edged along the wall her eyes were fixed on that doorway skifs were on the fight it was oddly silent compared with the tavern and streetfights he was used to there was no shouting no cursing only the clash of metal on metal and the occasional grunt of pain and it was getting bloody all of the bodyguards were marked not big wounds but they were bleeding it looked as if the four bodyguards should bring alberich down at any moment and yet he kept sliding out from beneath their blades as skif and his charges got closer and closer to their goal skif wanted to run and knew he didnt dare he didnt dare distract alberich and he didnt dare grab the attention of the guildmaster ten paces five there the girl who was leading the other two paused hesitating on the very threshold her face a mask of fear and indecision she didnt know what lay beyond that door it could be worse than what was here run skif hissed at her trusting that alberich had already cleared the way the girl didnt hesitate a moment longer she bolted into the halflit hallway hauling the other two with her skif started to follow hesitated and looked back there was a body on the floor and it wasnt alberichs while skifs back was turned the weaponsmaster had temporarily reduced the odds against himself by one but alberich was bleeding from the shoulder now skif couldnt tell how bad the wound was and alberich showed no sign of weakness but the leather tunic was slashed there and bloody flesh showed beneath the dark leather whenever he moved that arm skifs throat closed with fear somewhere deep inside hed been certain that alberich was invulnerable but he wasnt he could be hurt and if he could be hurt he could die at that moment the guildmaster finally noticed that his prizes had escaped stop them he shouted at his men dont let them get away skif froze in the doorway but he neednt have worried no one was taking orders now the fighters were too busy with alberich to pay any attention to skif although they redoubled their efforts to take the weaponsmaster down skif run get out of there now cymry cried no he said aloud he couldnt go not now he might be able to do something the lantern flames flickered and shadows danced on the walls a demonic echo of the death dance in the center of the room it was confusing too confusing once again skif felt for his knives and hesitated alberich was tiring oh it didnt show in how he moved but there was sweat rolling down his face he had taken another cut this time across his scalp and blood mingled with the drops of sweat that spattered down onto the dirt floor with every movement skif still didnt dare throw the knives even with one of the opponents down he edged away from the door and looked frantically for something else he could throw alberichs eyes glittered and his mouth was set in a wild and terrible smile he looked more than half mad and skif couldnt imagine why his opponents werent backing away just from his expression alone much less the singleminded ferocity with which he was fighting he did not look human that much was certain if this was how he always looked when he fought in earnest no wonder people were afraid of him no wonder he had never needed to draw a blade in those tavern brawls skifs eye fell on a pile of dirty bowls stacked against the wall on the other side of the doorway the remains perhaps of a meal the child snatchers had finished it didnt matter they were heavy enough to be weapons and they were within reach he snatched one up and waited for his opportunity it came sooner than hed hoped as alberich suddenly rushed one of the three men making him stumble backward in a hasty retreat that broke the swirling dance of steel for a moment broke the pattern long enough for skif to fling the bowl at the mans head it connected with the back of his skull with a sickening crack that made skif wince not hard enough to knock him out but enough to make him stagger dazed and that moment was just enough for alberich to slash savagely at his neck cutting halfway through it the man twisted in agony dropping to the floor blood everywhere as he writhed for a long and horrible moment then stilled skif froze watching in fascination aghast alberich did not nor did the two men still fighting they reacted by coming at alberich from both directions at once and in the rain of blows that followed alberich was wounded again a glancing slash across the arm that peeled back leather and a little flesh but he delivered a worse blow than he had gotten to the head of the third man who dropped like a stone at which point the first man whod been felled stood up shaking his head to clear it and plunged back into the fray skif shook himself out of his trance and flung two more bowls neither connected as well as the first the first man remaining was hit in the shoulder and the second in the back but the distraction was their undoing for they lost the initiative and alberich managed to get out of their trap nor could they pin him between them again the fight moved closer to the guildmaster alberich got the second man in the leg leaving his dagger in the mans thigh and the bodyguard staggered back skif threw his last bowl which hit the man nearest the guildmaster in the side of the face alberich saw his opening and took it with an allornothing lunge that carried him halfway across the room skif let out a strangled cry of horror if any fighter skif had ever seen before had tried that move it would have ended differently but this was alberich and he came in under the mans sword and inside his dagger and the next thing skif knew the point of alberichs sword was sticking out of the mans back and the man was gazing down at alberich with an utterly stupefied expression on his face then he toppled over slowly but he took alberichs sword with him and now the guildmaster struck because he had done nothing all this time skif had virtually forgotten he was there and had assumed that he was harmless perhaps alberich had done the same it was a mistaken assumption on both their parts the guildmaster moved like a ferret so fast that he seemed to blur and too fast for alberich exhausted as he was to react the guildmaster didnt have a weapon he didnt need one skif didnt couldnt see how it happened one moment alberich was still extended in his lunge the next the guildmaster had him pinned somehow trapped the guildmasters back was to the wall his arm was across alberichs throat with alberichs body protecting his both of alberichs hands were free and he clawed ineffectually at the arm across his throat the weaponsmasters face was already turning an unhealthy shade of pale blue kash the guildmaster said in a tight voice get the brat but the last man was in no condition to grab anyone cant he coughed legs out given the fact that his leg had been opened from thigh to knee with alberichs dagger still in the wound he had a point the guildmasters gaze snapped back onto skif well he said in that condescending voice hed used with jass i wouldnt have expected the heralds to use bait its not like them to put a child in danger skif bristled aint a child he said flatly oh youre a little young to be a herald the man countered in a sarcastic tone then he punched alberichs shoulder wound with his free hand making him gasp and putting a stop to alberichs attempts to claw himself free stop that youre only making things more difficult for yourself what has age to do with being a herald alberich rasped skif said nothing and the mans eyes narrowed as his arm tightened a little more on alberichs throat be still or i will snap your foolish neck for you a trainee then but still thats quite out of character unless he stared at skif then with a calculating expression and skif sensed that he was thinking very hard very hard indeed it was after all no secret that the latest trainee was a thief but what that would mean to this wealthy villain and whether hed heard that then the guildmasters eyes widened well he said and his mouth quirked up at one corner who would have thought it the heralds making common cause with a common thief oh excuse me youre quite an uncommon thief old bazies boy arent you skif is it skif went cold with shock and stared at the guildmaster with his mouth dropping open howd he know how the guildmaster smirked i make it my business to know what goes on in my properties as any good landlord would he said pointedly besides how do you think that cleverly hidden room got there who do you think arranged for the pump and the privy down there but you killed him skif cried as alberich tried to move and turned a little bluer for his trouble i had no intention of doing so the guildmaster pointed out in reasonable tones that was jass fault if hed obeyed orders everyone would have gotten out all right even bazie since skif had heard the truth of that with his own ears there was no debating the question of whether jass had gone far beyond what his orders had been but how would bazie have gotten out in time even so how the boys couldnt have carried him the guildmaster interrupted his thoughts his expression had gone very bland again he was planning something youve been very clever young man he said in a voice unctuous with flattery i dont see nearly enough cleverness in the people i hire well jass was a case in point now at the moment we seem to be at a stalemate alberich writhed in a futile attempt to get free his captor laughed and punched the shoulder wound again and alberich went white if i kill this herald he pointed out i lose my shield against whatever you might pick up and fling at me you cant go anywhere because kash is between you and the door stalemate skif nodded warily on the other hand he continued if you decided to switch allegiances i could strangle this fool and we could all escape from here before the help he has almost certainly arranged for arrives skif clenched his jaw in another time and place an just whatm i supposed to get out of this he asked playing for time to think cymry was oddly silent in his mind in fact in fact he couldnt sense her at all for the first time in weeks he was alone in his head what do you get oh skif skif havent you learned anything about the way life works the guildmaster laughed allow me to enlighten you no matter what these fools have told you the only law that counts is the law of the street what youll get is to be trained by me in something far more profitable than the liftin lay oh aye skif began heatedly no you listen to me this is what is real these are the rules that the real world runs by he stared into skifs eyes and skif couldnt look away couldnt stop listening to that voice so sure of itself so very very rational grab what you can because if you dont someone else will snatch it out from under you get all the dirt you can on anyone who might have power over you and believe me everyone has a past and things theyd rather not have bruited about be the cheater not the cheated because youll be one or the other theres no such thing as truth oh believe me about this there are shades of meaning and depths of selfinterest but there is no truth skif made an inarticulate sound of protest but it was weak because this was all hed seen at exiles gate this was the way the world as he had always known it worked not the way it was taught in the collegium not the way those sheltered idealistic heralds explained things and there is no faith either the guildmaster continued in his hard bright voice faith is for those who wish to be deceived for the sake of a comforting but hollow promise think about it boy think about it its shadow and air all of it cakes in the havens and crumbs in the street that is all that faith is about the priests oh the priests how many of them actually helped anyone in exiles gate in the here and now behind their cloister walls and their gates they never went hungry or cold they never suffered the least privations even the brothers at the priory never went hungry or cold skifs heart contracted into an icy little knot alberichs eyes were closed he seemed to be concentrating on getting what little air the guildmaster allowed him throw your lot in with me i wont deceive you with pretty fictions youll obey me because i am strong and smart and powerful youll learn from me to be the same and maybe some day youll be good enough to take what ive got away from me until then well have a deal and it will be because we know where we stand with each other not because of some artificial conceit that we like each other he laughed the smart man guards his own back boy the insidious voice went on the wise man knows there is no one that you can trust you take and hold whatever you can and share it with no one because no one will ever share what he has with you hate is for the strong love is for the weak no one has friends friend is just a pretty name for a leech or a user what do you think bazie was a user he used you boys and lived off of your work kept you as personal servants and pretended to love you so you would be as faithful to him as a pack of whipped puppies and that was where the guildmaster went too far bazie thought skif jarred free of the spell that insidiously logical voice had placed on him bazie had shared whatever he had and had trusted to his boys to do the same bazie had taken him in with no reason to and every reason to turn him into the street knowing that londer would be looking for him to silence him and beel beel had protected him beel could have reported a hundred times over that skif had fulfilled his education but he didnt and when beel could have told his own father where skif was hed kept his mouth shut and the heralds oh the heralds weak were they foolish skif felt warmth coming back into him felt his heart uncurling as he thought back along the past weeks and all of the little kindnesses all unasked for that hed gotten kris and coroc keeping the highborn blues from tormenting him until skif had established that he was more amusing if he wasnt taunted jeri helping him out with swordwork the teachers taking extra time to explain things he simply had never seen before housekeeper gaytha being so patient with his rough speech that sometimes he couldnt believe shed spend all this time over one trainee the girls teasing and laughing with him in the sewing room the simple way that he had been accepted by every trainee and with no other recommendation but that hed been chosen cymry cymry who had rilled his heart who still was there he sensed her again now that he wasnt listening to the poison that bastard was pouring into his ears cymry who cared enough for him to wait while he listened to make his own decisions without any pressure from her no love was there selfdelusion was it then ill be deluded did the guildmaster see his thoughts flicker across his face perhaps kash now he shouted the wounded bodyguard lunged arms outstretched to grab him but skif was already moving before the bodyguard clumsy with his wounds and pain had gotten a single step he jumped aside his hands flicking to each side as he evaded those outstretched arms and between one breath and the next the bodyguard continued his lunge and sprawled facedown on the floor gurgling in agony one of skifs knives in his throat the guildmaster made a strangled noise and so did alberich the arm around alberichs throat tightened as the guildmaster slid down the wall skifs other knife was lodged to the hilt in his eye but skifs dodge had been deliberately aimed to take him to alberichs side the guildmaster had been a stationary target and at that range he couldnt miss in the next heartbeat he had pried the dead arm away from the weaponsmasters throat and alberich was gasping in great huge gulps of air his color returning to normal skif helped him to his feet you all right he asked awkwardly alberich nodded talk may be hard he rasped skif laughed giddily feeling as if he had drunk two whole bottles of that fabulous wine all by himself like thats gonna make the trainees unhappy he taunted you not bein able to lecture em the wry expression on alberichs face only made him laugh harder come on he said draping his teachers arm over his shoulders we better get you outside an get back to where th good healers are afore your kantor decides hes gonna put horseshoe marks on my bum they got as far as the door when skif thought of something else i don suppose you did arrange for help did you well alberich admitted in a croak it comes now cymry half the collegium my love skif just shook his head figgers us heralds we just keep thinkin we gotta do everything by ourselves dont we we cant do the smart thing an get help fixed up beforehand even you an you should know better yes alberich agreed i should we do we it was a lovely word one that skif was coming to enjoy a very great deal a herald he didnt recognize brought skif his knives meticulously cleaned as the healer fussed over alberich right there in the street which was so full of torches and lanterns it might have been a festival well a very grim sort of festival it actually looked more like something out of a fever dream the street full of heralds and guards more guardsmen swarming in and out of the warehouse a halfdozen heralds and their companions surrounding alberich who flatly refused to lie down on a stretcher as the healer wanted while the weaponsmaster sat on an upturned barrel and the healer stitched up his wounds four bodies were laid out on the street under sheets one semiconscious bullyboy had been taken off for questioning as soon as he recovered not that anyone expected to get much out of him it wasnt very likely that a mere bodyguard would know the details of his masters operations no one had sent skif back to the collegium and he waited beside alberich between kantor and cymry listening with all his might to the grimvoiced conversations around him most of the heralds here he didnt know that was all right he didnt have to know who they were to understand that they were important he did recognize talamir though who seemed considerably less otherworldly at the moment and quite entirely focused on the here and now this is going to have an interesting effect on the council he observed his voice heavy with irony alberich snorted interesting boil up like a nest of ants when stirred with sticks it will sunlord guildmaster vatean suspect him even i did not gartheser is going to have a fit of apoplexy someone else observed vatean was here was here at his behest in the first place hadnt they noticed he was here this was high political stuff he was listening to they know cymry told him but youre a herald even if you arent in whites yet you proved yourself tonight no one is ever going to withhold any thing from you that you really want or need to know well interesting gartheser will be a pool of stillness compared to lady cathal talamir observed with a sigh he was a guildmaster after all and she speaks for the guilds oh guildmaster indeed someone else said dismissively becoming a master in the traders guild he left the sentence dangling but everyone including skif knew that the requirements for mastery in the traders guild mostly depended on entirely on how much profit you could make provided of course that you didnt cheat to make it or at least that you didnt get caught cheating he was talamir pointed out delicately and with a deliberate pause between the words quite prosperous and now know we where the profits came from alberich said harshly it is thinking i am that lady cathal should be looking into profits and whence from they come and lord gartheser said talamir since gartheser wished so sincerely to recommend him to the council there is that observed someone else in a hard cold voice and now we know where the leak of guard movements along evendim came from it would appear so talamir replied thoughtfully although it is in my mind that lord orthallen was equally though less blatantly impressed with the late guildmasters talents but a flurry of protests broke out over that remark it seemed that the idea of lord orthallen having anything to do with all of this was completely out of the question except that skif saw talamir and alberich exchange a private look and perhaps more than that looks werent all that could be exchanged when one was a herald and far more privately i wonder what all thats about and lord orthallen had particularly recommended jass to vatean well if he wanted to know no he didnt not at all he knew quite enough already all of this was going right over his head and anyway there wasnt anything one undersized thief could do about it even if he did know or if there was something one undersized thief could do about it he had no doubt that alberich would have a few words with him on the subject and maybe a job so perhaps his roofwalking days werent over after all better get myself another sneaky suit i believe that alberich already has that in mind said cymry the little group continued to paw over the few facts they had until they were shopworn and even talamir whose patience seemed endless grew weary of it enough he said silencing them all there is nothing more we can do until we know more the boy and alberich have told us all they know herald ryvial and our picked guardsmeninvestigators are on their way to vateans home even now and if there is anything to be found there rest assured they will find it every known associate of vatean will be under observation before sunrise long before word of his death leaks out uncle londer skif interrupted wearily now that the excitement was wearing off he was beginning to feel every bruise and was just a little sick and the man londer galko will also be observed talamir continued smoothly because he clearly knew a great deal about the child stealing although he is not connected with vatean in anyway now he looked at skif and put a hand on skifs shoulder that felt not at all patronizing comradely yes patronizing no trainee skif is weary to dropping herald alberich is in pain and we are fresh and have constructive work ahead of us i suggest we send them back to their beds while we get about it brothers there was a murmured chorus of assent as the healer put the last of the stitches into alberichs scalp wound and the heralds magically melted away leaving skif and alberich alone in a calm center in the midst of the bustle you wont travel in a stretcher as you should the healer said wearily as if he had made and lost this same argument far too many times to bother again so the best i can do is order you to back to the collegium and to rest teach from a stool i will tomorrow at least alberich told him the healer sighed and packed up his satchel i suppose thats the most i can get out of you he said and looked at kantor do what you can with him wont you the companion tossed his head in an emphatic nod and skif added jeri an herald visa can run th sword work for a week an coroc an kris can do archery kantor nodded even more emphatically alberich glared at him sourly made as if to shrug thought better of it and sighed a conspiracy it is he grumbled damn right skif said boldly and when alberich got to his feet and made as if to mount kantor stamped his foot and laid himself down so that alberich could get into the saddle without mounting when his herald was in place kantor rose and shook his head vigorously you make me an old woman alberich complained as skif got stiffly into cymrys saddle and the two of them headed up the street away from the scene of the activity riding side by side naw skif denied very much enjoying having the fearsome weaponsmaster at a temporary disadvantage just makin you be sensible ye see he continued waxing eloquent theres th difference between a herald an a thief ye don have t make a thief be sensible all thieves are sensible a thief that wont be sensible a thief in gaol is yes please spare me alberich growled but it didnt sound like his heart was in it and a moment later he glanced over at skif that was one of your mentor bazie that was one of the things he told you yes skif nodded and now revenge you have had true jass was dead vatean was dead the two men responsible for bazies horrible death were themselves dead skifs initial bargain with himself and with the heralds to work with alberich because they had a common cause was over regrets alberich prompted skif shook his head then changed his mind sort of there werent no justice but it was your own hand that struck vatean down alberich said as if he were surprised it was skifs turn to bestow a sour look now don you go tryin that sly word twistin on me he said i know what youre tryin tdo an don pretend you aint no there werent no justice th bastid is dead dead quick an easy he didn have tanswer fer nothin an we aint never gonna find out a half of what he was into i got revenge an i don like it revenge don get you nothin there you happy now but alberich surprised him no little brother he said gently i am not happy because my brother is unhappy and there it was the sour taste in skifs mouth faded and although the vengeance he thought he had wanted turned out to be nothing like what he really would have wanted if hed had the choice well i am not happy because my brother is unhappy that that was worth everything hed gone through to get here ah ill get over it he sighed hey i get t boss you around fer a week eh kantor thats worth somethin once again kantor nodded his head with vigor and alberich groaned feelingly this he complained but with a suspicious twinkle in his eye is putting the henhouse in the foxs charge rrrrr skif growled showing his teeth promise wont have too much chicken and i suppose you will insist on going into whites now that a hero you are alberich continued looking pained hah you are outa your head th healer was right skif countered what me run afore i can walk not likely sides he continued contemplating all the potential fun he could have over the next four years in the collegium i aint fleeced a quarter of them highborn blues yet nor got all i can outa them artificer blues alberich regarded him with a jaundiced eye i foresee and foresight is my gift a great deal of trouble with you at its center and that no trainee in the history of valdemar will have more demerits against his name before you go into whites suits me skif replied saucily so long as i have fun doing it fun for you yes alberich sighed fun for the rest of us however extracting you from the tangles you make itll be worth it skif insisted once again feeling that giddy elation bubbling up inside him as he felt the warmth of acceptance encircle him and hold him at its heart and in spite of present pain and future concerns herald alberich gave him a real unalloyed smile oh there is no doubt it will be worth it he said and skif had the sense that he meant more than just the subject of skifs future mischief he meant skifs very existence as one of the trainees now and heralds to come no matter who objected or how strenuously to the presence of a thief among them he confirmed that with his next breath welcome very welcome to the collegium skif it seems we were always right to take a thief
