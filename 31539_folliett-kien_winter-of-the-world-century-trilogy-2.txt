tommys son contents part one the other cheek part two a season of blood part three the cold peace part one the other cheek carla knew her parents were about to have a row the second she walked into the kitchen she felt the hostility like the bonedeep cold of the wind that blew through the streets of berlin before a february snowstorm she almost turned and walked back out again it was unusual for them to fight mostly they were affectionate too much so carla cringed when they kissed in front of other people her friends thought it was strange their parents did not do that she had said that to her mother once mother had laughed in a pleased way and said the day after our wedding your father and i were separated by the great war she had been born english though you could hardly tell i stayed in london while he came home to germany and joined the army carla had heard this story many times but mother never tired of telling it we thought the war would last three months but i didnt see him again for five years all that time i longed to touch him now i never tire of it father was just as bad your mother is the cleverest woman i have ever met he had said here in the kitchen just a few days ago thats why i married her it had nothing to do with he had tailed off and mother and he had giggled conspiratorially as if carla at the age of eleven knew nothing about sex it was so embarrassing but once in a while they had a quarrel carla knew the signs and a new one was about to erupt they were sitting at opposite ends of the kitchen table father was sombrely dressed in a darkgrey suit starched white shirt and black satin tie he looked dapper as always even though his hair was receding and his waistcoat bulged a little beneath the gold watch chain his face was frozen in an expression of false calm carla knew that look he wore it when one of the family had done something that angered him he held in his hand a copy of the weekly magazine for which mother worked the democrat she wrote a column of political and diplomatic gossip under the name of lady maud father began to read aloud our new chancellor herr adolf hitler made his debut in diplomatic society at president hindenburgs reception the president was the head of state carla knew he was elected but he stood above the squabbles of daytoday politics acting as referee the chancellor was the premier although hitler had been made chancellor his nazi party did not have an overall majority in the reichstag the german parliament so for the present the other parties could restrain nazi excesses father spoke with distaste as if forced to mention something repellent like sewage he looked uncomfortable in a formal tailcoat carlas mother sipped her coffee and looked out of the window to the street as if interested in the people hurrying to work in scarves and gloves she too was pretending to be calm but carla knew that she was just waiting for her moment the maid ada was standing at the counter in an apron slicing cheese she put a plate in front of father but he ignored it herr hitler was evidently charmed by elisabeth cerruti the cultured wife of the italian ambassador in a rosepink velvet gown trimmed with sable mother always wrote about what people were wearing she said it helped the reader to picture them she herself had fine clothes but times were hard and she had not bought anything new for years this morning she looked slim and elegant in a navyblue cashmere dress that was probably as old as carla signora cerruti who is jewish is a passionate fascist and they talked for many minutes did she beg hitler to stop whipping up hatred of jews father put the magazine down on the table with a slap here it comes carla thought you realize that will infuriate the nazis he said i hope so mother said coolly the day theyre pleased with what i write i shall give it up theyre dangerous when riled mothers eyes flashed anger dont you dare condescend to me walter i know theyre dangerous thats why i oppose them i just dont see the point of making them irate you attack them in the reichstag father was an elected parliamentary representative for the social democratic party i take part in a reasoned debate this was typical carla thought father was logical cautious lawabiding mother had style and humour he got his way by quiet persistence she with charm and cheek they would never agree father added i dont drive the nazis mad with fury perhaps thats because you dont do them much harm father was irritated by her quick wit his voice became louder and you think you damage them with jokes i mock them and thats your substitute for argument i believe we need both father became angrier but maud dont you see how youre putting yourself and your family at risk on the contrary the real danger is not to mock the nazis what would life be like for our children if germany became a fascist state this kind of talk made carla feel queasy she could not bear to hear that the family was in danger life must go on as it always had she wished she could sit in this kitchen for an eternity of mornings with her parents at opposite ends of the pine table ada at the counter and her brother erik thumping around upstairs late again why should anything change she had listened to political talk every breakfasttime of her life and she thought she understood what her parents did and how they planned to make germany a better place for everyone but lately they had begun to talk in a different way they seemed to think that a terrible danger loomed but carla could not quite imagine what it was father said god knows im doing everything i can to hold back hitler and his mob and so am i but when you do it you believe youre following a sensible course mothers face hardened in resentment and when i do it im accused of putting the family at risk and with good reason said father the row was only just getting started but at that moment erik came down clattering like a horse on the stairs and lurched into the kitchen with his school satchel swinging from his shoulder he was thirteen two years older than carla and there were unsightly black hairs sprouting from his upper lip when they were small carla and erik had played together all the time but those days were over and since he had grown so tall he had pretended to think that she was stupid and childish in fact she was smarter than he and knew about a lot of things he did not understand such as womens monthly cycles what was that last tune you were playing he said to mother the piano often woke them in the morning it was a steinway grand inherited like the house itself from fathers parents mother played in the morning because she said she was too busy during the rest of the day and too tired in the evening this morning she had performed a mozart sonata then a jazz tune its called tiger rag she told erik do you want some cheese jazz is decadent erik said dont be silly ada handed erik a plate of cheese and sliced sausage and he began to shovel it into his mouth carla thought his manners were dreadful father looked severe whos been teaching you this nonsense erik hermann braun says that jazz isnt music just negroes making a noise hermann was eriks best friend his father was a member of the nazi party hermann should try to play it father looked at mother and his face softened she smiled at him he went on your mother tried to teach me ragtime many years ago but i couldnt master the rhythm mother laughed it was like trying to get a giraffe to rollerskate the fight was over carla saw with relief she began to feel better she took some black bread and dipped it in milk but now erik wanted an argument negroes are an inferior race he said defiantly i doubt that father said patiently if a negro boy were brought up in a nice house full of books and paintings and sent to an expensive school with good teachers he might turn out to be smarter than you thats ridiculous erik protested mother put in dont call your father ridiculous you foolish boy her tone was mild she had used up her anger on father now she just sounded wearily disappointed you dont know what youre talking about and neither does hermann braun erik said but the aryan race must be superior we rule the world your nazi friends dont know any history father said the ancient egyptians built the pyramids when germans were living in caves arabs ruled the world in the middle ages the muslims were doing algebra when german princes could not write their own names its nothing to do with race carla frowned and said what is it to do with then father looked at her fondly thats a very good question and youre a bright girl to ask it she glowed with pleasure at his praise civilizations rise and fall the chinese the aztecs the romans but no one really knows why eat up everyone and put your coats on mother said its getting late father pulled his watch out of his waistcoat pocket and looked at it with raised eyebrows its not late ive got to take carla to the francks house mother said the girls school is closed for a day something about repairing the furnace so carlas going to spend today with frieda frieda franck was carlas best friend their mothers were best friends too in fact when they were young friedas mother monika had been in love with father a hilarious fact that friedas grandmother had revealed one day after drinking too much sekt father said why cant ada look after carla ada has an appointment with the doctor ah carla expected father to ask what was wrong with ada but he nodded as if he already knew and put his watch away carla wanted to ask but something told her she should not she made a mental note to ask mother later then she immediately forgot about it father left first wearing a long black overcoat then erik put on his cap perching it as far back on his head as it would go without falling off as was the fashion among his friends and followed father out of the door carla and her mother helped ada clear the table carla loved ada almost as much as she loved her mother when carla was little ada had taken care of her fulltime until she was old enough to go to school for mother had always worked ada was not married yet she was twentynine and homely looking though she had a lovely kind smile last summer she had had a romance with a policeman paul huber but it had not lasted carla and her mother stood in front of the mirror in the hall and put on their hats mother took her time she chose a darkblue felt with a round crown and a narrow brim the type all the women were wearing but she tilted hers at a different angle making it look chic as carla put on her knitted wool cap she wondered whether she would ever have mothers sense of style mother looked like a goddess of war her long neck and chin and cheekbones carved out of white marble beautiful yes but definitely not pretty carla had the same dark hair and green eyes but looked more like a plump doll than a statue carla had once accidentally overheard her grandmother say to mother your ugly duckling will grow into a swan youll see carla was still waiting for it to happen when mother was ready they went out their home stood in a row of tall gracious town houses in the mitte district the old centre of the city built for highranking ministers and army officers such as carlas grandfather who had worked at the nearby government buildings carla and her mother rode a tram along unter den linden then took the strain from friedrich strasse to the zoo station the francks lived in the southwestern suburb of schöneberg carla was hoping to see friedas brother werner who was fourteen she liked him sometimes carla and frieda imagined that they had each married the others brother and were nextdoor neighbours and their children were best friends it was just a game to frieda but secretly carla was serious werner was handsome and grownup and not a bit silly like erik in the dolls house in carlas bedroom the mother and father sleeping side by side in the miniature double bed were called carla and werner but no one knew that not even frieda frieda had another brother axel who was seven but he had been born with spina bifida and had to have constant medical care he lived in a special hospital on the outskirts of berlin mother was preoccupied on the journey i hope this is going to be all right she muttered half to herself as they got off the train of course it will carla said ill have a lovely time with frieda i didnt mean that im talking about my paragraph about hitler are we in danger was father right your father is usually right what will happen to us if weve annoyed the nazis mother stared at her strangely for a long moment then said dear god what kind of a world did i bring you into then she went quiet after a tenminute walk they arrived at a grand villa in a big garden the francks were rich friedas father ludwig owned a factory making radio sets two cars stood in the drive the large shiny black one belonged to herr franck the engine rumbled and a cloud of blue vapour rose from the tail pipe the chauffeur ritter with uniform trousers tucked into high boots stood cap in hand ready to open the door he bowed and said good morning frau von ulrich the second car was a little green twoseater a short man with a grey beard came out of the house carrying a leather case and touched his hat to mother as he got into the small car i wonder what dr rothmann is doing here so early in the morning mother said anxiously they soon found out friedas mother monika came to the door she was a tall woman with a mass of red hair anxiety showed on her pale face instead of welcoming them in she stood squarely in the doorway as if to bar their entrance frieda has measles she said im so sorry said mother how is she miserable she has a fever and a cough but rothmann says shell be all right however shes quarantined of course have you had it yes when i was a girl and werner has too i remember he had a terrible rash all over but what about your husband ludi had it as a boy both women looked at carla she had never had measles she realized this meant that she could not spend the day with frieda carla was disappointed but mother was quite shaken this weeks magazine is our election issue i cant be absent she looked distraught all the grownups were apprehensive about the general election to be held next sunday mother and father both feared the nazis might do well enough to take full control of the government plus my oldest friend is visiting from london i wonder whether walter could be persuaded to take a day off to look after carla monika said why dont you telephone to him not many people had phones in their homes but the francks did and carla and her mother stepped into the hall the instrument stood on a spindly legged table near the door mother picked it up and gave the number of fathers office at the reichstag the parliament building she got through to him and explained the situation she listened for a minute then looked angry my magazine will urge a hundred thousand readers to campaign for the social democratic party she said do you really have something more important than that to do today carla could guess how this argument would end father loved her dearly she knew but in all her eleven years he had never looked after her for a whole day all her friends fathers were the same men did not do that sort of thing but mother sometimes pretended not to know the rules women lived by ill just have to take her to the office with me then mother said into the phone i dread to think what jochmann will say herr jochmann was her boss hes not much of a feminist at the best of times she replaced the handset without saying goodbye carla hated it when they fought and this was the second time in a day it made the whole world seem unstable she was much more scared of quarrels than of the nazis come on then mother said to her and she moved to the door im not even going to see werner carla thought unhappily just then friedas father appeared in the hall a pinkfaced man with a small black moustache energetic and cheerful he greeted mother pleasantly and she paused to speak politely to him while monika helped him into a black topcoat with a fur collar he went to the foot of the stairs werner he shouted im going without you he put on a grey felt hat and went out im ready im ready werner ran down the stairs like a dancer he was as tall as his father and more handsome with redblond hair worn too long under his arm he had a leather satchel that appeared to be full of books in the other hand he held a pair of ice skates and a hockey stick he paused in his rush to say good morning frau von ulrich very politely then in a more informal tone hello carla my sisters got the measles carla felt herself blush for no reason at all i know she said she tried to think of something charming and amusing to say but came up with nothing ive never had it so i cant see her i had it when i was a kid he said as if that was ever such a long time ago i must hurry he added apologetically carla did not want to lose sight of him so quickly she followed him outside ritter was holding the rear door open what kind of car is that carla asked boys always knew the makes of cars a mercedesbenz w limousine it looks very comfortable she caught a look from her mother half surprised and half amused werner said do you want a lift that would be nice ill ask my father werner put his head inside the car and said something carla heard herr franck reply very well but hurry up she turned to her mother we can go in the car mother hesitated for only a moment she did not like herr francks politics he gave money to the nazis but she was not going to refuse a lift in a warm car on a cold morning how very kind of you ludwig she said they got in there was room for four in the back ritter pulled away smoothly i assume youre going to koch strasse said herr franck many newspapers and book publishers had their offices in the same street in the kreuzberg district please dont go out of your way leipziger strasse would be fine id be happy to take you to the door but i suppose you dont want your leftist colleagues to see you getting out of the car of a bloated plutocrat his tone was somewhere between humorous and hostile mother gave him a charming smile youre not bloated ludi just a little plump she patted the front of his coat he laughed i asked for that the tension eased herr franck picked up the speaking tube and gave instructions to ritter carla was thrilled to be in a car with werner and she wanted to make the most of it by talking to him but at first she could not think what to speak about she really wanted to say when youre older do you think you might marry a girl with dark hair and green eyes about three years younger than yourself and clever eventually she pointed to his skates and said do you have a match today no just practice after school what position do you play in she knew nothing about ice hockey but there were always positions in team games right wing isnt it a rather dangerous sport not if youre quick you must be ever such a good skater not bad he said modestly once again carla caught her mother watching her with an enigmatic little smile had she guessed how carla felt about werner carla felt another blush coming then the car came to a stop outside a school building and werner got out goodbye everyone he said and ran through the gates into the yard ritter drove on following the south bank of the landwehr canal carla looked at the barges their loads of coal topped with snow like mountains she felt a sense of disappointment she had contrived to spend longer with werner by hinting that she wanted a lift then she had wasted the time talking about ice hockey what would she have liked to have talked to him about she did not know herr franck said to mother i read your column in the democrat i hope you enjoyed it i was sorry to see you writing disrespectfully about our chancellor do you think journalists should write respectfully about politicians mother replied cheerfully thats radical the nazi press would have to be polite about my husband they wouldnt like that not all politicians obviously franck said irritably they crossed the teeming junction of potsdamer platz cars and trams vied with horsedrawn carts and pedestrians in a chaotic melee mother said isnt it better for the press to be able to criticize everyone equally a wonderful idea he said but you socialists live in a dream world we practical men know that germany cannot live on ideas people must have bread and shoes and coal i quite agree mother said i could use more coal myself but i want carla and erik to grow up as citizens of a free country you overrate freedom it doesnt make people happy they prefer leadership i want werner and frieda and poor axel to grow up in a country that is proud and disciplined and united and in order to be united we need young thugs in brown shirts to beat up elderly jewish shopkeepers politics is rough nothing we can do about it on the contrary you and i are leaders ludwig in our different ways its our responsibility to make politics less rough more honest more rational less violent if we do not do that we fail in our patriotic duty herr franck bristled carla did not know much about men but she realized that they did not like to be lectured on their duty by women mother must have forgotten to press her charm switch this morning but everyone was tense the coming election had them all on edge the car reached leipziger platz where may i drop you herr franck said coldly just here will be fine said mother franck tapped on the glass partition ritter stopped the car and hurried to open the door mother said i do hope frieda gets better soon thank you they got out and ritter closed the door the office was several minutes walk away but mother clearly had not wanted to stay any longer in the car carla hoped mother was not going to quarrel permanently with herr franck that might make it difficult for her to see frieda and werner she would hate that they set off at a brisk pace try not to make a nuisance of yourself at the office mother said the note of genuine pleading in her voice touched carla making her feel ashamed of causing her mother worry she resolved to behave perfectly mother greeted several people on the way she had been writing her column for as long as carla could remember and was well known in the press corps they all called her lady maud in english near the building in which the democrat had its office they saw someone they knew sergeant schwab he had fought with father in the great war and still wore his hair brutally short in the military style after the war he had worked as a gardener first for carlas grandfather and later for her father but he had stolen money from mothers purse and father had sacked him now he was wearing the ugly military uniform of the storm troopers the brownshirts who were not soldiers but nazis who had been given the authority of auxiliary policemen schwab said loudly good morning frau von ulrich as if he felt no shame at all about being a thief he did not even touch his cap mother nodded coldly and walked past him i wonder what hes doing here she muttered uneasily as they went inside the magazine had the first floor of a modern office building carla knew a child would not be welcome and she hoped they could reach mothers office without being seen but they met herr jochmann on the stairs he was a heavy man with thick spectacles whats this he said brusquely speaking around the cigarette in his mouth are we running a kindergarten now mother did not react to his rudeness i was thinking over your comment the other day she said about how young people imagine journalism is a glamorous profession and dont understand how much hard work is necessary he frowned did i say that well its certainly true so i brought my daughter here to see the reality i think it will be good for her education especially if she becomes a writer she will make a report on the visit to her class i felt sure you would approve mother was making this up as she went along but it sounded convincing carla thought she almost believed it herself the charm switch had been turned to the on position at last jochmann said dont you have an important visitor from london coming today yes ethel leckwith but shes an old friend she knew carla as a baby jochmann was somewhat mollified hmm well we have an editorial meeting in five minutes as soon as ive bought some cigarettes carla will get them for you mother turned to her there is a tobacconist three doors down herr jochmann likes the rothhändle brand oh that will save me a trip jochmann gave carla a onemark coin mother said to her when you come back youll find me at the top of the stairs next to the fire alarm she turned away and took jochmanns arm confidentially i thought last weeks issue was possibly our best ever she said as they went up carla ran out into the street mother had got away with it using her characteristic mixture of boldness and flirting she sometimes said we women have to deploy every weapon we have thinking about it carla realized that she had used mothers tactics to get a lift from herr franck perhaps she was like her mother after all that might be why mother had given her that curious little smile she was seeing herself thirty years ago there was a queue in the shop half the journalists in berlin seemed to be buying their supplies for the day at last carla got a pack of rothhändle and returned to the democrat building she found the fire alarm easily it was a big lever fixed to the wall but mother was not in her office no doubt she had gone to that editorial meeting carla walked along the corridor all the doors were open and most of the rooms were empty but for a few women who might have been typists and secretaries at the back of the building around a corner was a closed door marked conference room carla could hear male voices raised in argument she tapped on the door but there was no response she hesitated then turned the handle and went in the room was full of tobacco smoke eight or ten people sat around a long table mother was the only woman they fell silent apparently surprised when carla went up to the head of the table and handed jochmann the cigarettes and change their silence made her think she had done wrong to come in but jochmann just said thank you youre welcome sir she said and for some reason she gave a little bow the men laughed one said new assistant jochmann then she knew it was all right she left the room quickly and returned to mothers office she did not take off her coat the place was cold she looked around on the desk were a phone a typewriter and stacks of paper and carbon paper next to the phone was a photograph in a frame showing carla and erik with father it had been taken a couple of years ago on a sunny day at the beach by the wannsee lake fifteen miles from the centre of berlin father was wearing shorts they were all laughing that was before erik had started to pretend to be a tough serious man the only other picture hanging on the wall showed mother with the socialdemocratic hero friedrich ebert who had been the first president of germany after the war it had been taken about ten years ago carla smiled at mothers shapeless lowwaisted dress and boyish haircut they must have been fashionable at the time the bookshelf held social directories phone books dictionaries in several languages and atlases but nothing to read in the desk drawer were pencils several new pairs of formal gloves still wrapped in tissue paper a packet of sanitary towels and a notebook with names and phone numbers carla reset the desk calendar to todays date monday february then she put a sheet of paper into the typewriter she typed her full name heike carla von ulrich at the age of five she had announced that she did not like the name heike and she wanted everyone to use her second name and somewhat to her surprise her family had complied each key of the typewriter caused a metal rod to rise up and strike the paper through an inky ribbon printing a letter when by accident she pressed two keys the rods got stuck she tried to prise them apart but she could not pressing another key did not help now there were three jammed rods she groaned she was in trouble already a noise from the street distracted her she went to the window a dozen brownshirts were marching along the middle of the road shouting slogans death to all jews jews go to hell carla could not understand why they got so angry about jews who seemed the same as everyone else apart from their religion she was startled to see sergeant schwab at the head of the troop she had felt sorry for him when he was sacked for she knew he would find it hard to get another job there were millions of men looking for jobs in germany father said it was a depression but mother had said how can we have a man in our house who steals their chant changed smash jew papers they said in unison one of them threw something and a rotten vegetable splashed on the door of a national newspaper then to carlas horror they turned towards the building she was in she drew back and peeped around the edge of the window frame hoping that they could not see her they stopped outside still chanting one threw a stone it hit carlas window without breaking it but all the same she gave a little scream of fear a moment later one of the typists came in a young woman in a red beret whats the matter she said then she looked out of the window oh hell the brownshirts entered the building and carla heard boots on the stairs she was scared what were they going to do sergeant schwab came into mothers office he hesitated seeing the two females then seemed to screw up his nerve he picked up the typewriter and threw it through the window shattering the glass carla and the typist both screamed more brownshirts passed the doorway shouting their slogans schwab grabbed the typist by the arm and said now darling wheres the office safe in the file room she said in a terrified voice show me yes anything he marched her out of the room carla started to cry then stopped herself she thought of hiding under the desk but hesitated she did not want to show them how scared she was something inside her wanted to defy them but what should she do she decided to warn mother she stepped to the doorway and looked along the corridor the brownshirts were going in and out of the offices but had not reached the far end carla did not know whether the people in the conference room could hear the commotion she ran along the corridor as fast as she could but a scream stopped her she looked into a room and saw schwab shaking the typist with the red beret yelling wheres the key i dont know i swear im telling the truth the typist cried carla was outraged schwab had no right to treat a woman that way she shouted leave her alone schwab you thief schwab looked at her with hatred in his eyes and suddenly she was ten times more frightened then his gaze shifted to someone behind her and he said get the kid out of the damn way she was picked up from behind are you a little jew said a mans voice you look it with all that dark hair that terrified her im not jewish she screamed the brownshirt carried her back along the corridor and put her down in mothers office she stumbled and fell to the floor stay in here he said and he went away carla got to her feet she was not hurt the corridor was full of brownshirts now and she could not get to her mother but she had to summon help she looked out of the smashed window a small crowd was gathering on the street two policemen stood among the onlookers chatting carla shouted at them help help police they saw her and laughed that infuriated her and anger made her less frightened she looked outside the office again her gaze lit on the fire alarm on the wall she reached up and grasped the handle she hesitated you were not supposed to sound the alarm unless there was a fire and a notice on the wall warned of dire penalties she pulled the handle anyway for a moment nothing happened perhaps the mechanism was not working then there came a loud harsh klaxon sound rising and falling which filled the building almost immediately the people from the conference room appeared at the far end of the corridor jochmann was first what the devil is going on he said angrily shouting over the noise of the alarm one of the brownshirts said this jew communist rag has insulted our leader and were closing it down get out of my office the brownshirt ignored him and went into a side room a moment later there was a female scream and a crash that sounded like a steel desk being overturned jochmann turned to one of his staff schneider call the police immediately carla knew that would be no good the police were here already doing nothing mother pushed through the knot of people and came running along the corridor are you all right she cried she threw her arms around carla carla did not want to be comforted like a child pushing her mother away she said im fine dont worry mother looked around my typewriter they threw it through the window carla realized that now she would not get into trouble for jamming the mechanism we must get out of here mother snatched up the desk photo then took carlas hand and they hurried out of the room no one tried to stop them running down the stairs ahead of them a wellbuilt young man who might have been one of the reporters had a brownshirt in a headlock and was dragging him out of the building carla and her mother followed the pair out another brownshirt came behind them the reporter approached the two policemen still dragging the brownshirt arrest this man he said i found him robbing the office you will find a stolen jar of coffee in his pocket release him please said the older of the two policemen reluctantly the reporter let the brownshirt go the second brownshirt stood beside his colleague what is your name sir the policeman asked the reporter i am rudolf schmidt chief parliamentary correspondent of thedemocrat rudolph schmidt i am arresting you on a charge of assaulting the police dont be ridiculous i caught this man stealing the policeman nodded to the two brownshirts take him to the station house they grabbed schmidt by the arms he seemed about to struggle then changed his mind every detail of this incident will appear in the next edition of the democrat he said there will never be another edition the policeman said take him away a fire engine arrived and half a dozen firemen jumped out their leader spoke brusquely to the police we need to clear the building he said go back to your fire station theres no fire said the older policeman its just the storm troopers closing down a communist magazine thats no concern of mine the fireman said the alarm has been sounded and our first task is to get everyone out storm troopers and all well manage without your help he led his men inside carla heard her mother say oh no she turned and saw that mother was staring at her typewriter which lay on the pavement where it had fallen the metal casing had dropped away exposing the links between keys and rods the keyboard was twisted out of shape one end of the roller had become detached and the bell that sounded for the end of a line lay forlornly on the ground a typewriter was not a precious object but mother looked as if she might cry the brownshirts and the staff of the magazine came out of the building herded by firemen sergeant schwab was resisting shouting angrily theres no fire the firemen just shoved him on jochmann came out and said to mother they didnt have time to do much damage the firemen stopped them whoever sounded the alarm did us a great service carla had been worried that she would be reprimanded for causing a false alarm now she realized that she had done exactly the right thing she took her mothers hand that seemed to jerk mother out of her momentary fit of grief she wiped her eyes with her sleeve an unusual act that revealed how badly shaken she was if carla had done that she would have been told to use her handkerchief what do we do now mother never said that she always knew what to do next carla became aware of two people standing nearby she looked up one was a woman about the same age as mother very pretty with an air of authority carla knew her but could not place her beside her was a man young enough to be her son he was slim and not very tall but he looked like a movie star he had a handsome face that would have been almost too pretty except that his nose was flattened and misshapen both newcomers looked shocked and the young man was white with anger the woman spoke first and she used the english language hello maud she said and the voice was distantly familiar to carla dont you recognize me she went on im eth leckwith and this is lloyd ii lloyd williams found a boxing club in berlin where he could do an hours training for a few pennies it was in a workingclass district called wedding north of the city centre he exercised with the indian clubs and the medicine ball skipped rope hit the punch bag and then put on a helmet and did five rounds in the ring the club coach found him a sparring partner a german his own age and size lloyd was a welterweight the german boy had a nice fast jab that came from nowhere and hurt lloyd several times until lloyd hit him with a left hook and knocked him down lloyd had been raised in a rough neighbourhood the east end of london at the age of twelve he had been bullied at school same thing happened to me his stepfather bernie leckwith had said cleverest boy in school and you get picked on by the class shlammer dad was jewish his mother had spoken only yiddish he had taken lloyd to the aldgate boxing club ethel had been against it but bernie had overruled her something that did not happen often lloyd had learned to move fast and punch hard and the bullying had stopped he had also got the broken nose that made him look less of a pretty boy and he had discovered a talent he had quick reflexes and a combative streak and he had won prizes in the ring the coach was disappointed that he wanted to go to cambridge university instead of turning professional he showered and put his suit back on then went to a workingmens bar bought a glass of draft beer and sat down to write to his halfsister millie about the incident with the brownshirts millie was envious of him taking this trip with their mother and he had promised to send her frequent bulletins lloyd had been shaken by this mornings fracas politics was part of everyday life for him his mother had been a member of parliament his father was a local councillor in london and he himself was london chairman of the labour league of youth but it had always been a matter of debating and voting until today he had never before seen an office trashed by uniformed thugs while the police looked on smiling it was politics with the gloves off and it had shocked him could this happen in london millie he wrote his first instinct was to think that it could not but hitler had admirers among british industrialists and newspaper proprietors only a few months ago the rogue mp sir oswald mosley had started the british union of fascists like the nazis they had to strut up and down in militarystyle uniforms what next he finished his letter and folded it then caught the strain back into the city centre he and his mother were going to meet walter and maud von ulrich for dinner lloyd had been hearing about maud all his life she and his mother were unlikely friends ethel had started her working life as a maid in a grand house owned by mauds family later they had been suffragettes together campaigning for votes for women during the war they had produced a feminist newspaper the soldiers wife then they had quarrelled over political tactics and become estranged lloyd could remember vividly the von ulrich familys trip to london in he had been ten old enough to feel embarrassed that he spoke no german while erik and carla aged five and three were bilingual that was when ethel and maud had patched up their quarrel he made his way to the restaurant bistro robert the interior was art deco with unforgivingly rectangular chairs and tables and elaborate iron lampstands with coloured glass shades but he liked the starched white napkins standing to attention beside the plates the other three were already there the women were striking he realized as he approached the table both poised well dressed attractive and confident they were getting admiring glances from other diners he wondered how much of his mothers modish dress sense had been picked up from her aristocratic friend when they had ordered ethel explained her trip i lost my parliamentary seat in she said i hope to win it back at the next election but meanwhile i have to make a living fortunately maud you taught me to be a journalist i didnt teach you much maud said you had a natural talent im writing a series of articles about the nazis for the news chronicle and i have a contract to write a book for a publisher called victor gollancz i brought lloyd as my interpreter hes studying french and german lloyd observed her proud smile and felt he did not deserve it my translation skills have not been much tested he said so far weve mostly met people like you who speak perfect english lloyd had ordered breaded veal a dish he had never even seen in england he found it delicious while they were eating walter said to him shouldnt you be at school mam thought i would learn more german this way and the school agreed why dont you come and work for me in the reichstag for a while unpaid im afraid but youd be speaking german all day lloyd was thrilled id love to what a marvellous opportunity if ethel can spare you walter added she smiled perhaps i can have him back now and again when i really need him of course ethel reached across the table and touched walters hand it was an intimate gesture and lloyd realized that the bond between these three was very close how kind you are walter she said not really i can always use a bright young assistant who understands politics ethel said im not sure i understand politics any more what on earth is happening here in germany maud said we were doing all right in the midtwenties we had a democratic government and a growing economy but everything was ruined by the wall street crash of now were in the depths of a depression her voice shook with an emotion that seemed close to grief you can see a hundred men standing in line for one advertised job i look at their faces theyre desperate they dont know how theyre going to feed their children then the nazis offer them hope and they ask themselves what have i got to lose walter seemed to think she might be overstating the case in a more cheerful tone he said the good news is that hitler has failed to win over a majority of germans in the last election the nazis got a third of the votes nevertheless they were the largest party but fortunately hitler only leads a minority government thats why he demanded another election maud put in he needs an overall majority to turn germany into the brutal dictatorship he wants will he get it ethel asked no said walter yes said maud walter said i dont believe the german people will ever actually vote for a dictatorship but it wont be a fair election maud said angrily look what happened to my magazine today anyone who criticizes the nazis is in danger meanwhile their propaganda is everywhere lloyd said nobody seems to fight back he wished that he had arrived a few minutes earlier at the democrat office that morning so that he could have punched a few brownshirts he realized he was making a fist and forced himself to open his hand but the indignation did not go away why dont leftwingers raid the offices of nazi magazines give them a taste of their own medicine we must not meet violence with violence maud said emphatically hitler is looking for an excuse to crack down to declare a national emergency sweep away civil rights and put his opponents in jail her voice took on a pleading note we must avoid giving him that pretext no matter how hard it is they finished their meal the restaurant began to empty out as their coffee was served they were joined by the owner walters distant cousin robert von ulrich and the chef jörg robert had been a diplomat at the austrian embassy in london before the great war while walter was doing the same thing at the german embassy there and falling in love with maud robert resembled walter but was more fussily dressed with a gold pin in his tie seals on his watch chain and heavily slicked hair jörg was younger a blond man with delicate features and a cheerful smile the two had been prisoners of war together in russia now they lived in an apartment over the restaurant they reminisced about the wedding of walter and maud held in great secrecy on the eve of the war there had been no guests but robert and ethel had been best man and bridesmaid ethel said we had champagne at the hotel then i tactfully said that robert and i would leave and walter she suppressed a fit of giggles walter said oh i assumed we would all have dinner together maud chuckled you can imagine how pleased i was about that lloyd looked into his coffee feeling embarrassed he was eighteen and a virgin and honeymoon jokes made him uncomfortable more sombrely ethel asked maud do you ever hear from fitz these days lloyd knew that the secret wedding had caused a terrible rift between maud and her brother earl fitzherbert fitz had disowned her because she had not gone to him as head of the family and asked his permission to marry maud shook her head sadly i wrote to him that time we went to london but he refused even to see me i hurt his pride by marrying walter without telling him my brother is an unforgiving man im afraid ethel paid the bill everything in germany was cheap if you had foreign currency they were about to get up and leave when a stranger came to the table and uninvited pulled up a chair he was a heavy man with a small moustache in the middle of a round face he wore a brownshirt uniform robert said coldly what may i do for you sir my name is criminal commissar thomas macke he grabbed a passing waiter by the arm and said bring me a coffee the waiter looked enquiringly at robert who nodded i work in the political department of the prussian police macke went on i am in charge of the berlin intelligence section lloyd translated for his mother in a low voice however said macke i wish to speak to the proprietor of the restaurant about a personal matter robert said where did you work a month ago the unexpected question startled macke and he replied immediately at the police station in kreuzberg and what was your job there i was in charge of records why do you ask robert nodded as if he had expected something like this so you have gone from a job as a filing clerk to head of the berlin intelligence section congratulations on your rapid promotion he turned to ethel when hitler became chancellor at the end of january his henchman hermann göring took the role of interior minister of prussia in charge of the largest police force in the world since then göring has been firing policemen wholesale and replacing them with nazis he turned back to macke and said sarcastically however in the case of our surprise guest im sure the promotion was purely on merit macke flushed but kept his temper as i said i wish to speak to the proprietor about something personal please come and see me in the morning would ten oclock suit you macke ignored this suggestion my brother is in the restaurant business he ploughed on ah perhaps i know him macke is the name what kind of establishment does he run a small place for working men in friedrichshain ah then it isnt likely that i have met him lloyd was not sure that it was wise for robert to be so waspish macke was rude and did not deserve kindness but he could probably make serious trouble macke went on my brother would like to buy this restaurant your brother wants to move up in the world as you have we are prepared to offer you twenty thousand marks payable over two years jörg burst out laughing robert said permit me to explain something to you commissar i am an austrian count twenty years ago i had a castle and a large country estate in hungary where my mother and sister lived in the war i lost my family my castle my lands and even my country which was miniaturized his tone of amused sarcasm had gone and his voice became gruff with emotion i came to berlin with nothing but the address of walter von ulrich my distant cousin nevertheless i managed to open this restaurant he swallowed it is all i have he paused and drank some coffee the others around the table were silent he regained his poise and something of his superior tone of voice even if you offered a generous price which you have not i would still refuse because i would be selling my whole life i have no wish to be rude to you even though you have behaved unpleasantly but my restaurant is not for sale at any price he stood up and held out his hand to shake goodnight commissar macke macke automatically shook hands then looked as if he regretted it he stood up clearly angry his fat face was a purplish colour we will talk again he said and he walked out what an oaf said jörg walter said to ethel you see what we have to put up with just because he wears that uniform he can do anything he likes what had bothered lloyd was mackes confidence he had seemed to feel sure that he could buy the restaurant at the price he named he reacted to roberts refusal as if it was no more than a temporary setback were the nazis already so powerful this was the kind of thing oswald mosley and his british fascists wanted a country in which the rule of law was replaced by bullying and beating how could people be so damn stupid they put on their coats and hats and said goodnight to robert and jörg as soon as they stepped outside lloyd smelled smoke not tobacco but something else the four of them got into walters car a bmw dixi which lloyd knew was a germanmanufactured austin seven as they drove through the tiergarten park two fire engines overtook them bells clanging i wonder where the fire is said walter a moment later they saw the glow of flames through the trees maud said it seems to be near the reichstag walters tone changed wed better take a look he said worriedly and he made a sudden turn the smell of smoke grew stronger over the tops of the trees lloyd could see flames shooting skywards its a big fire he said they emerged from the park on to the königs platz the broad plaza between the reichstag building and the kroll opera house opposite the reichstag was ablaze red and yellow light danced behind the classical rows of windows flame and smoke jetted up through the central dome oh no said walter and to lloyd he sounded stricken with grief oh god in heaven no he stopped the car and they all got out this is a catastrophe said walter ethel said such a beautiful old building i dont care about the building walter said surprisingly its our democracy thats on fire a small crowd watched from a distance of about fifty yards in front of the building fire engines were lined up their hoses already playing on the flames water jetting in through broken windows a handful of policemen stood around doing nothing walter spoke to one of them i am a reichstag deputy he said when did this start an hour ago the policeman said weve got one of them that did it a man with nothing on but his trousers he used his clothes to start the fire you should put up a rope cordon walter said with authority keep people at a safe distance yes sir said the policeman and went off lloyd slipped away from the others and moved nearer to the building the firemen were bringing the blaze under control there was less flame and more smoke he walked past the fire engines and approached a window it did not seem very dangerous and anyway his curiosity overcame his sense of selfpreservation as usual when he peered through a window he saw that the destruction was severe walls and ceilings had collapsed into piles of rubble as well as firemen he saw civilians in coats presumably reichstag officials moving around in the debris assessing the damage lloyd went to the entrance and climbed the steps two black mercedes cars roared up just as the police were erecting their cordon lloyd looked on with interest out of the second car jumped a man in a lightcoloured trench coat and a floppy black hat he had a narrow moustache under his nose lloyd realized that he was looking at the new chancellor adolf hitler behind hitler followed a taller man in the black uniform of the schutzstaffel the ss his personal bodyguard limping after them came the jewhating propaganda chief joseph goebbels lloyd recognized them from newspaper photographs he was so fascinated to see them close up that he forgot to be horrified hitler ran up the steps two at a time heading directly towards lloyd on impulse lloyd pushed open the big door and held it wide for the chancellor with a nod to him hitler walked in and his entourage followed lloyd joined them no one spoke to him hitlers people seemed to assume he was one of the reichstag staff and vice versa there was a foul smell of wet ashes hitler and his party stepped over charred beams and hosepipes treading in mucky puddles in the entrance hall stood hermann göring a camelhair coat covering his huge belly his hat turned up in front potsdamfashion this was the man who was packing the police force with nazis lloyd thought recalling the conversation in the restaurant as soon as göring saw hitler he shouted this is the beginning of the communist uprising now theyll strike out theres not a minute to waste lloyd felt weirdly as if he were in the audience at the theatre and these powerful men were being played by actors hitler was even more histrionic than göring there will be no mercy now he shrieked he sounded as if he was addressing a stadium anyone who stands in our way will be butchered he trembled as he worked himself up into a fury every communist functionary will be shot where he is found the communist deputies to the reichstag must be hanged this very night he looked as if he would burst but there was something artificial about it all hitlers hatred seemed real but the outburst was also a performance put on for the benefit of those around him his own people and others he was an actor feeling a genuine emotion but amplifying it for the audience and it was working lloyd saw everyone within earshot was staring mesmerized göring said my führer this is my chief of political police rudolf diels he indicated a slim darkhaired man at his side he has already arrested one of the perpetrators diels was not hysterical calmly he said marinus van der lubbe a dutch construction worker and a communist göring said triumphantly diels said expelled from the dutch communist party for starting fires i knew it said hitler lloyd saw that hitler was determined to blame the communists regardless of the facts diels said deferentially from my first interrogation of the man i have to say that it is clear that he is a lunatic working alone nonsense hitler cried this was planned long in advance but they miscalculated they dont understand that the people are on our side göring turned to diels the police are on an emergency footing from this moment he said we have lists of communists reichstag deputies local government elected representatives communist party organizers and activists arrest them all tonight firearms should be used ruthlessly interrogate them without mercy yes minister said diels lloyd realized that walter had been right to worry this was the pretext the nazis had been looking for they were not going to listen to anyone who said that the fire had been started by a lone madman they wanted a communist plot so that they could announce a crackdown göring looked down with distaste at the muck on his shoes my official residence is only a minute away but it is fortunately unaffected by the fire my führer he said perhaps we should adjourn there yes we have much to discuss lloyd held the door and they all went out as they drove away he stepped over the police cordon and rejoined his mother and the von ulrichs ethel said lloyd where have you been i was worried sick i went inside he said what how no one stopped me its all chaos and confusion his mother threw her hands in the air he has no sense of danger she said i met adolf hitler walter said did he say anything hes blaming the communists for the fire theres going to be a purge god help us said walter iii thomas macke was still smarting from the sarcasm of robert von ulrich your brother wants to move up in the world as you have von ulrich had said macke wished he had thought to reply and why should we not we are as good as you you arrogant popinjay now he yearned for revenge but for a few days he was too busy to do anything about it the headquarters of the prussian secret police were in a large elegant building of classical architecture at no prinz albrecht strasse in the government quarter macke felt proud every time he walked through the door it was a hectic time four thousand communists had been arrested within twentyfour hours of the reichstag fire and more were being rounded up every hour germany was being cleansed of a plague and to macke the berlin air already tasted purer but the police files were not up to date people had moved house elections had been lost and won old men had died and young men had taken their places macke was in charge of a group updating the records finding new names and addresses he was good at this he liked registers directories street maps news clippings any kind of list his talents had not been valued at the kreuzberg police station where criminal intelligence was simply beating up suspects until they named names he was hoping to be better appreciated here not that he had any problem with beating up suspects in his office at the back of the building he could hear the screams of men and women being tortured in the basement but it did not bother him they were traitors subversives and revolutionaries they had ruined germany with their strikes and they would do worse if they got the chance he had no sympathy for them he only wished robert von ulrich was among them groaning in agony and begging for mercy it was eight oclock in the evening on thursday march before he got a chance to check on robert he sent his team home and took a sheaf of updated lists upstairs to his boss criminal inspector kringelein then he returned to the files he was in no hurry to go home he lived alone his wife an undisciplined woman had gone off with a waiter from his brothers restaurant saying she wanted to be free there were no children he began to comb the files he had already established that robert von ulrich had joined the nazi party in and had left two years later that in itself did not mean much macke needed more the filing system was not as logical as he would have liked all in all he was disappointed in the prussian police the rumour was that göring was equally unimpressed and planned to detach the political and intelligence departments from the regular force and form them into a new more efficient secret police force macke thought that was a good idea meanwhile he failed to find robert von ulrich in any of the regular files perhaps that was not merely a sign of inefficiency the man might be blameless as an austrian count he was unlikely to be a communist or a jew it seemed the worst that could be said of him was that his cousin walter was a social democrat that was not a crime not yet macke now realized that he should have done this research before approaching the man but he had gone ahead without full information he might have known that was a mistake in consequence he had been forced to submit to condescension and sarcasm he had felt humiliated but he would get his own back he began to go through miscellaneous papers in a dusty cupboard at the back of the room the name of von ulrich did not appear here either but there was one document missing according to the list pinned to the inside of the cupboard door there should have been a file of pages entitled vice establishments it sounded like a survey of berlins nightclubs macke could guess why it was not here it must have been in use recently all the more decadent night spots had been closed down when hitler became chancellor macke went back upstairs kringelein was briefing uniformed police who were to raid the updated addresses macke had provided of communists and their allies macke did not hesitate to interrupt his boss kringelein was not a nazi and would therefore be afraid to reprimand a storm trooper macke said im looking for the vice establishments file kringelein looked annoyed but made no protest on the side table he said help yourself macke took the file and returned to his own room the survey was five years old it detailed the clubs then in existence and stated what activities went on in them gambling indecent displays prostitution sale of drugs homosexuality and other depravities the file named owners and investors club members and employees macke patiently read each entry perhaps robert von ulrich was a drug addict or a user of whores berlin was famous for its homosexual clubs macke ploughed through the dreary entry on the pink slipper where men danced with men and the floor show featured transvestite singers sometimes he thought his work was disgusting he ran his finger down the list of members and found robert von ulrich he gave a sigh of satisfaction looking farther down he saw the name of jörg schleicher well well he said lets see how sarcastic you are now iv the next time lloyd saw walter and maud he found them angrier and more scared it was the following saturday march the day before the election lloyd and ethel were planning to attend a social democratic party rally organized by walter and they went to the von ulrichs home in mitte for lunch beforehand it was a nineteenthcentury house with spacious rooms and large windows though much of the furniture was worn the lunch was plain pork chops with potatoes and cabbage but there was good wine with it walter and maud talked as if they were poor and no doubt they were living more simply than their parents had but all the same they were not going hungry however they were frightened but had persuaded germanys aging president paul von hindenburg to approve the reichstag fire decree which gave the nazis authority for what they were already doing beating and torturing their political opponents twenty thousand people have been arrested since monday night walter said his voice shaking not just communists but people the nazis call communist sympathizers which means anyone they dislike said maud ethel said how can there be a democratic election now we must do our best walter said if we dont campaign it will only help the nazis lloyd said impatiently when will you stop accepting this and start to fight back do you still believe it would be wrong to meet violence with violence absolutely said maud peaceful resistance is our only hope walter said the social democratic party has a paramilitary wing the reichsbanner but its weak a small group of social democrats proposed a violent response to the nazis but they were outvoted maud said remember lloyd the nazis have the police and the army on their side walter looked at his pocket watch we must get going maud said suddenly walter why dont you cancel he stared at her in surprise seven hundred tickets have been sold oh to blazes with the tickets maud said im worried about you dont worry seats have been carefully allocated so there should be no troublemakers in the hall lloyd was not sure that walter was as confident as he pretended walter went on anyway i cannot let down people who are still willing to come to a democratic political meeting they are all the hope that remains to us youre right maud said she looked at ethel perhaps you and lloyd should stay home its dangerous no matter what walter says and this isnt your country after all socialism is international ethel said stoutly like your husband i appreciate your concern but im here to witness german politics first hand and im not going to miss this well the children cant go maud said erik said i dont even want to go carla looked disappointed but said nothing walter maud ethel and lloyd got into walters little car lloyd was nervous but excited too he was getting a perspective on politics superior to anything his friends back home had and if there was going to be a fight he was not afraid they drove east crossing alexander platz into a neighbourhood of poor houses and small shops some of which had signs in hebrew letters the social democratic party was workingclass but like the british labour party it had a few affluent supporters walter von ulrich was in a small upperclass minority the car pulled up outside a marquee that said peoples theatre a line had already formed outside walter crossed the pavement to the door waving to the waiting crowd who cheered lloyd and the others followed him inside walter shook hands with a solemn young man of about eighteen this is wilhelm frunze secretary of the local branch of our party frunze was one of those boys who looked as if they had been born middleaged he wore a blazer with buttoned pockets that had been fashionable ten years ago frunze showed walter how the theatre doors could be barred from the inside when the audience is seated we will lock up so that no troublemakers can get in he said very good said walter well done frunze ushered them into the auditorium walter went up on stage and greeted some other candidates who were already there the public began to come in and take their seats frunze showed maud ethel and lloyd to reserved places in the front row two boys approached the younger who looked about fourteen but was taller than lloyd greeted maud with careful good manners and made a little bow maud turned to ethel and said this is werner franck the son of my friend monika then she said to werner does your father know youre here yes he said i should find out about social democracy myself hes broadminded for a nazi lloyd thought this was a rather tough line to take with a fourteenyearold but werner was a match for her my father doesnt really believe in nazism but he thinks hitler is good for german business wilhelm frunze said indignantly how can it be good for business to throw thousands of people into jail apart from the injustice they cant work werner said i agree with you and yet hitlers crackdown is popular people think theyre being saved from a bolshevik revolution frunze said the nazi press has them convinced that the communists were about to launch a campaign of murder arson and poison in every town and village the boy with werner who was shorter but older said and yet it is the brownshirts not the communists who drag people into basements and break their bones with clubs he spoke german fluently with a slight accent that lloyd could not place werner said forgive me i forgot to introduce vladimir peshkov he goes to the berlin boys academy my school and hes always called volodya lloyd stood up to shake hands volodya was about lloyds age a striking young man with a frank blueeyed gaze frunze said i know volodya peshkov i go to the berlin boys academy too volodya said wilhelm frunze is the school genius top marks in physics and chemistry and maths its true said werner maud looked hard at volodya and said peshkov is your father grigori yes frau von ulrich he is a military attaché at the soviet embassy so volodya was russian he spoke german effortlessly lloyd thought with a touch of envy no doubt that came from living here i know your parents well maud said to volodya she knew all the diplomats in berlin lloyd had already gathered it was part of her job frunze checked his watch and said time to begin he went up on stage and called for order the theatre went quiet frunze announced that the candidates would make speeches and then take questions from the audience tickets had been issued only to social democratic party members he added and the doors were now closed so everyone could speak freely knowing they were among friends it was like being a member of a secret society lloyd thought this was not what he called democracy walter spoke first he was no demagogue lloyd observed he had no rhetorical flourishes but he flattered his audience telling them that they were intelligent and wellinformed men and women who understood the complexity of political issues he had been speaking for only a few minutes when a brownshirt walked on stage lloyd cursed how had he got in he had come from the wings someone must have opened the stage door he was a huge brute with an army haircut he stepped to the front of the stage and shouted this is a seditious gathering communists and subversives are not wanted in todays germany the meeting is closed the confident arrogance of the man outraged lloyd he wished he could get this great oaf in a boxing ring wilhelm frunze leaped to his feet stood in front of the intruder and yelled furiously get out of here you thug the man shoved him in the chest powerfully frunze staggered back stumbled and fell over backwards the audience were on their feet some shouting in angry protest some screaming in fear more brownshirts appeared from the wings lloyd realized with dismay that the bastards had planned this well the man who had shoved frunze shouted out the other brownshirts took up the cry out out out there were about twenty of them now and more appearing all the time some carried police nightsticks or improvised clubs lloyd saw a hockey stick a wooden sledgehammer even a chair leg they strutted up and down the stage grinning fiendishly and waving their weapons as they chanted and lloyd had no doubt that they were itching to start hitting people he was on his feet without thinking he werner and volodya had formed a protective line in front of ethel and maud half the audience were trying to leave the other half shouting and shaking their fists at the intruders those attempting to get out were shoving others and minor scuffles had broken out many of the women were crying on stage walter grasped the lectern and shouted everyone try to keep calm please there is no need for disorder most people could not hear and the rest ignored him the brownshirts began to jump off the stage and to wade into the audience lloyd took his mothers arm and werner did the same with maud they moved towards the nearest exit in a group but all the doors were already jammed with knots of panicking people trying to leave that made no difference to the brownshirts who kept yelling at people to get out the attackers were mostly ablebodied whereas the audience included women and old men lloyd wanted to fight back but it was not a good idea a man in a great war steel helmet shouldered lloyd and he lurched forward and bumped into his mother he resisted the temptation to turn and confront the man his priority was to protect mam a spottyfaced boy carrying a truncheon put a hand on werners back and shoved energetically yelling get out get out werner turned quickly and took a step towards him dont touch me you fascist pig he said the brownshirt suddenly stopped dead and looked scared as if he had not been expecting resistance werner turned away again concentrating like lloyd on getting the two women to safety but the huge man had heard the exchange and yelled who are you calling a pig he lashed out at werner hitting the back of his head with his fist his aim was poor and it was a glancing blow but all the same werner cried out and staggered forward volodya stepped between them and hit the big man in the face twice lloyd admired volodyas rapid onetwo but turned his attention back to his task seconds later the four of them reached the doorway lloyd and werner managed to help the women out into the theatre foyer here the crush eased and the violence stopped there were no brownshirts seeing the women safe lloyd and werner looked back into the auditorium volodya was fighting the big man bravely but he was in trouble he kept punching the mans face and body but his blows had little effect and the man shook his head as if pestered by an insect the brownshirt was heavyfooted and slowmoving but he hit volodya in the chest and then the head and volodya staggered the big man drew back his fist for a massive punch lloyd was afraid it could kill volodya then walter took a flying leap off the stage and landed on the big mans back lloyd wanted to cheer they fell to the floor in a blur of arms and legs and volodya was saved for the moment the spotty youth who had shoved werner was now harassing the people trying to leave hitting their backs and heads with his truncheon you fucking coward lloyd yelled stepping forward but werner was ahead of him he shoved past lloyd and grabbed the truncheon trying to wrestle it away from the youth the older man in the steel helmet joined in and hit werner with a pickaxe handle lloyd stepped forward and hit the older man with a straight right the blow landed perfectly next to the mans left eye but he was a war veteran and not easily discouraged he swung around and lashed out at lloyd with his club lloyd dodged the blow easily and hit him twice more he connected in the same area around the mans eyes breaking the skin but the helmet protected the mans head and lloyd could not land a left hook his knockout punch he ducked a swing of the pickaxe handle and hit the mans face again and the man backed away blood pouring from cuts around his eyes lloyd looked around he saw that the social democrats were fighting back now and he got a jolt of savage pleasure most of the audience had passed through the doors leaving mainly young men in the auditorium and they were coming forward clambering over the theatre seats to get at the brownshirts and there were dozens of them something hard struck his head from behind it was so painful that he roared he turned to see a boy of his own age holding a length of timber raising it to strike again lloyd closed with him and hit him hard in the stomach twice first with his right fist then with his left the boy gasped for breath and dropped the wood lloyd hit him with an uppercut to the chin and the boy passed out lloyd rubbed the back of his head it hurt like hell but there was no blood the skin on his knuckles was raw and bleeding he saw he bent down and picked up the length of timber dropped by the boy when he looked around again he was thrilled to see some of the brownshirts retreating clambering up on to the stage and disappearing into the wings presumably aiming to leave through the stage door by which they had entered the big man who had started it all was on the floor groaning and holding his knee as if he had dislocated something wilhelm frunze stood over him hitting him with a wooden shovel again and again repeating at the top of his voice the words the man had used to start the riot not wanted in todays germany helpless the big man tried to roll away from the blows but frunze went after him until two more brownshirts grabbed the mans arms and dragged him away frunze let them go did we beat them lloyd thought with growing exultation maybe we did several of the younger men chased their opponents up on to the stage but they stopped there and contented themselves with shouting insults as the brownshirts disappeared lloyd looked at the others volodya had a swollen face and one closed eye werners jacket was ripped a big square of cloth dangling walter was sitting on a frontrow seat breathing hard and rubbing his elbow but he was smiling frunze threw his shovel away sailing it across the rows of empty seats to the back werner who was only fourteen was exultant we gave them hell didnt we lloyd grinned yes we certainly did volodya put his arm around frunzes shoulders not bad for a bunch of schoolboys eh walter said but they stopped our meeting the youngsters stared resentfully at him for spoiling their triumph walter looked angry be realistic boys our audience has fled in terror how long will it be before those people have the nerve to go to a political meeting again the nazis have made their point its dangerous even to listen to any party other than theirs the big loser today is germany werner said to volodya i hate those fucking brownshirts i think i might join you communists volodya looked at him hard with those intense blue eyes and spoke in a low voice if youre serious about fighting the nazis there might be something more effective you could do lloyd wondered what volodya meant then maud and ethel came running back into the auditorium both speaking at the same time crying and laughing with relief and lloyd forgot volodyas words and never thought of them again v four days later erik von ulrich came home in a hitler youth uniform he felt like a prince he had a brown shirt just like the one worn by storm troopers with various patches and a swastika armband he also had the regulation black tie and black shorts he was a patriotic soldier dedicated to the service of his country at last he was one of the gang this was even better than supporting hertha berlins favourite soccer team erik was taken to matches occasionally on saturdays when his father did not have a political meeting to attend that gave him a similar sense of belonging to a great big crowd of people all feeling the same emotions but hertha sometimes lost and he came home disconsolate the nazis were winners he was terrified of what his father was going to say his parents infuriated him by insisting on marching out of step all the boys were joining the hitler youth they had sports and singing and adventures in the fields and forests outside the city they were smart and fit and loyal and efficient erik was deeply troubled by the thought that he might have to fight in battle some day his father and grandfather had and he wanted to be ready for that trained and hardened disciplined and aggressive the nazis hated communists but so did mother and father so what if the nazis hated jews as well the von ulrichs were not jewish why should they care but mother and father stubbornly refused to join in well erik was fed up with being left out and he had decided to defy them he was scared stiff as usual neither mother nor father was at the house when erik and carla came home from school ada pursed her lips disapprovingly as she served their tea but she said youll have to clear the table yourselves today ive got a terrible backache im going to lie down carla looked concerned is that what you had to see the doctor about ada hesitated before replying yes thats right she was obviously hiding something the thought of ada being ill and lying about it made erik uneasy he would never go as far as carla and say he loved ada but she had been a kindly presence all his life and he was more fond of her than he liked to say carla was just as concerned i hope it gets better lately carla had become more grownup somewhat to eriks bewilderment although he was two years older he still felt like a kid but she acted like an adult half the time ada said reassuringly ill be fine after a rest erik ate some bread when ada left the room he swallowed and said im only in the junior section but as soon as im fourteen i can move up carla said fathers going to hit the roof are you mad herr lippmann said that father will be in trouble if he tries to make me leave oh brilliant said carla she had developed a streak of withering sarcasm that sometimes stung erik so youll get father into a row with the nazis she said scornfully what a great idea so good for the whole family erik was taken aback he had not thought of it that way but all the boys in my class are members he said indignantly except for frenchy fontaine and jewboy rothmann carla spread fish paste on her bread why do you have to be the same as the others she said most of them are stupid you told me rudi rothmann was the cleverest boy in the class i dont want to be with frenchy and rudi erik cried and to his mortification he felt tears come to his eyes why should i have to play with the boys no one likes this was what had given him the courage to defy his father he could no longer bear to walk out of school with the jews and the foreigners while all the german boys marched around the playing field in their uniforms they both heard a cry erik looked at carla and said what was that carla frowned it was ada i think then more distinctly they heard help erik got to his feet but carla was ahead of him he went after her adas room was in the basement they ran down the stairs and into the small bedroom there was a narrow single bed up against the wall ada was lying there her face screwed up in pain her skirt was wet and there was a puddle on the floor erik could hardly believe what he was seeing had she pissed herself it was scary there were no other grownups in the house he did not know what to do carla was scared too erik could see it in her face but she was not panicked she said ada whats wrong her voice sounded strangely calm my waters broke ada said erik had no idea what that meant nor did carla i dont understand she said it means my baby is coming youre pregnant carla said in astonishment erik said but youre not married carla said furiously shut up erik dont you know anything he did know of course that women could have babies when they were not married but surely not ada thats why you went to the doctor last week carla said to ada ada nodded erik was still trying to get used to the idea do you think mother and father know of course they do they just didnt tell us fetch a towel where from the airing cupboard on the upstairs landing a clean one of course a clean one erik ran up the stairs took a small white towel from the cupboard and ran down again thats not much good carla said but she took it and dried adas legs ada said the babys coming soon i can feel it but i dont know what to do she started to cry erik was watching carla she was in charge now it did not matter that he was the older one he looked to her for leadership she was being practical and staying calm but he could tell that she was terrified and her composure was fragile she could crack at any minute he thought carla turned to erik again go and fetch dr rothmann she said you know where his office is erik was hugely relieved to have been given a task he could manage then he thought of a snag what if hes out then ask frau rothmann what you should do you idiot carla said get going run erik was glad to get out of the room what was happening there was mysterious and frightening he went up the stairs three at a time and flew out of the front door running was one thing he did know how to do the doctors surgery was half a mile away he settled into a fast trot as he ran he thought about ada who was the father of her baby he recalled that she had gone to the movies with paul huber a couple of times last summer had they had sexual intercourse they must have erik and his friends talked about sex a lot but they did not really know anything about it where had ada and paul done it not in a movie theatre surely didnt people have to lie down he was baffled dr rothmanns place was in a poorer street he was a good doctor erik had heard mother say but he treated a lot of workingclass people who could not pay high fees the doctors house had a consulting room and a waiting room on the ground floor and the family lived upstairs outside was parked a green opel an ugly little twoseater unofficially called the tree frog the front door of the house was unlatched erik walked in breathing hard and entered the waiting room there was an old man coughing in a corner and a young woman with a baby hello erik called dr rothmann the doctors wife stepped out of the consulting room hannelore rothmann was a tall fair woman with strong features and she gave erik a look like thunder how dare you come to this house in that uniform she said erik was petrified frau rothmann was not jewish but her husband was erik had forgotten that in his excitement our maid is having a baby he said and so you want a jewish doctor to help you erik was taken completely by surprise it had never occurred to him that the nazis attacks might cause the jews to retaliate but suddenly he saw that frau rothmann made total sense the brownshirts went around shouting death to jews why should a jewish doctor help such people now he did not know what to do there were other doctors of course plenty of them but he did not know where nor whether they would come out to see a total stranger my sister sent me he said feebly carlas got a lot more sense than you ada said the waters have broken erik was not sure what that meant but it sounded significant with a disgusted look frau rothmann went back into the consulting room the old man in the corner cackled were all dirty jews until you need our help he said then its please come dr rothmann and whats your advice lawyer koch and lend me a hundred marks herr goldman and he was overcome by a fit of coughing a girl of about sixteen came in from the hall erik thought she must be the rothmanns daughter eva he had not seen her for years she had breasts now but she was still plain and dumpy she said did your father let you join the hitler youth he doesnt know said erik oh boy said eva youre in trouble he looked from her to the consultingroom door do you think your fathers going to come he said your mother was awfully cross with me of course hell come eva said if people are sick he helps them her voice became scornful he doesnt check their race or politics first were not nazis she went out again erik felt bewildered he had not expected this uniform to get him into so much trouble at school everyone thought it was wonderful a moment later dr rothmann appeared speaking to the two waiting patients he said ill be back as soon as i can im sorry but a baby wont wait to be born he looked at erik come on young man youd better ride with me despite that uniform erik followed him out and got into the passenger seat of the tree frog he loved cars and was desperate to be old enough to drive and normally he enjoyed riding in any vehicle watching the dials and studying the drivers technique but now he felt as if he were on display sitting beside a jewish doctor in his brown shirt what if herr lippmann should see him the trip was agony fortunately it was short in a couple of minutes they were at the von ulrich house whats the young womans name rothmann asked ada hempel ah yes she came to see me last week the babys early all right take me to her erik led the way into the house he heard a baby cry it had come already he hurried down to the basement the doctor following ada lay on her back the bed was soaked with blood and something else carla stood holding a tiny baby in her arms the baby was covered in slime something that looked like thick string ran from the baby up adas skirt carla was wideeyed with terror what must i do she cried youre doing exactly the right thing doctor rothmann reassured her just hold that baby close a minute longer he sat beside ada he listened to her heart took her pulse and said how do you feel my dear im so tired she said rothmann gave a satisfied nod he stood up again and looked at the baby in carlas arms a little boy he said erik watched with a mixture of fascination and revulsion as the doctor opened his bag took out some thread and tied two knots in the cord while he was doing so he spoke to carla in a soft voice why are you crying youve done a marvellous job youve delivered a baby all on your own you hardly needed me youd better be a doctor when you grow up carla became calmer then she whispered look at his head the doctor had to lean towards her to hear i think theres something wrong with him i know the doctor took out a pair of sharp scissors and cut the cord between the two knots then he took the naked baby from carla and held him at arms length studying him erik could not see anything wrong but the baby was so red and wrinkled and slimy that it was hard to tell however after a thoughtful moment the doctor said oh dear looking more carefully erik could see that there was something wrong the babys face was lopsided one side was normal but on the other the head seemed dented and there was something strange about the eye rothmann handed the baby back to carla ada groaned again and seemed to strain when she relaxed rothmann reached under her skirt and drew out a lump of something that looked disgustingly like meat erik he said fetch me a newspaper erik said which one his parents took all the main papers every day any one lad said rothmann gently i dont want to read it erik ran upstairs and found yesterdays vossische zeitung when he returned the doctor wrapped the meaty thing in the paper and put it on the floor its what we call the afterbirth he said to carla best to burn it later then he sat on the edge of the bed again ada my dear girl you must be very brave he said your baby is alive but there may be something wrong with him were going to wash him and wrap him up warmly then we must take him to the hospital ada looked frightened whats the matter i dont know we need to have him checked will he be all right the hospital doctors will do everything they can the rest we must leave to god erik remembered that jews worshipped the same god as christians it was easy to forget that rothmann said do you think you could get up and come to the hospital with me ada baby needs you to feed him im so tired she said again take a minute or two to rest then but not much more because baby needs to be looked at soon carla will help you get dressed ill wait upstairs he addressed erik with gentle irony come with me little nazi erik wanted to squirm dr rothmanns forbearance was even worse than frau rothmanns scorn as they were leaving ada said doctor yes my dear his name is kurt a very good name said dr rothmann he went out and erik followed vi lloyd williamss first day working as assistant to walter von ulrich was also the first day of the new parliament walter and maud were struggling frantically to save germanys fragile democracy lloyd shared their desperation partly because they were good people whom he had known on and off all his life and partly because he feared that britain could follow germany down the road to hell the election had resolved nothing the nazis got per cent an increase but still short of the per cent they craved walter saw hope driving to the opening of the parliament he said even with massive intimidation they failed to win the votes of most germans he banged his fist on the steering wheel despite everything they say they are not popular and the longer they stay in government the better people will get to know their wickedness lloyd was not so sure theyve closed opposition newspapers thrown reichstag deputies in jail and corrupted the police he said and yet fortyfour per cent of germans approve i dont find that reassuring the reichstag building was badly firedamaged and quite unusable so the parliament assembled in the kroll opera house on the opposite side of the königs platz it was a vast complex with three concert halls and fourteen smaller auditoria plus restaurants and bars when they arrived they had a shock the place was surrounded by brownshirts deputies and their aides crowded around the entrances trying to get in walter said furiously is this how hitler plans to get his way by preventing us from entering the chamber lloyd saw that the doors were barred by brownshirts they admitted those in nazi uniform without question but everyone else had to produce credentials a boy younger than lloyd looked him up and down contemptuously before grudgingly letting him in this was intimidation pure and simple lloyd felt his temper beginning to simmer he hated to be bullied he knew he could knock the brownshirt boy down with one good left hook he forced himself to remain calm turn away and walk through the door after the fight in the peoples theatre his mother had examined the eggshaped lump on his head and ordered him to go home to england he had talked her round but it had been a close thing she said he had no sense of danger but that was not quite right he did get scared sometimes but it always made him feel combative his instinct was to go on the attack not to retreat this scared his mother ironically she was just the same she was not going home she was frightened but she was also thrilled to be here in berlin at this turning point in german history and outraged by the violence and repression she was witnessing and she felt sure she could write a book that would forewarn democrats in other countries about fascist tactics youre worse than me lloyd had said to her and she had had no answer inside the opera house was swarming with brownshirts and ss men many of them armed they guarded every door and showed with looks and gestures their hatred and contempt for anyone not supporting the nazis walter was late for a social democratic party group meeting lloyd hurried around the building looking for the right room glancing into the debating chamber he saw that a giant swastika hung from the ceiling dominating the room the first matter to be discussed when proceedings began that afternoon was to be the enabling act which would permit hitlers cabinet to pass laws without the approval of the reichstag the act offered a dreadful prospect it would make hitler a dictator the repression intimidation violence torture and murder that germany had seen in the past few weeks would become permanent it was unthinkable but lloyd could not imagine that any parliament in the world would pass such a law they would be voting themselves out of power it was political suicide he found the social democrats in a small auditorium their meeting had already begun lloyd hurried walter to the room then he was sent for coffee waiting in the queue he found himself behind a pale intenselooking young man dressed in funereal black lloyds german had become more fluent and colloquial and he now had the confidence to strike up a conversation with a stranger the man in black was heinrich von kessel he learned he was doing the same sort of job as lloyd working as an unpaid aide to his father gottfried von kessel a deputy for the centre party which was catholic my father knows walter von ulrich very well heinrich said they were both attachés at the german embassy in london in the world of international politics and diplomacy was quite small lloyd reflected heinrich told lloyd that a return to the christian faith was the answer to germanys problems im not much of a christian lloyd said candidly i hope you dont mind my saying so my grandparents are welsh biblepunchers but my mother is indifferent and my stepfathers jewish occasionally we go to the calvary gospel hall in aldgate mainly because the pastor is a labour party member heinrich smiled and said ill pray for you catholics were not proselytizers lloyd remembered what a contrast to his dogmatic grandparents in aberowen who thought that people who did not believe as they did were wilfully blinding themselves to the gospel and would be condemned to eternal damnation when lloyd reentered the social democratic party meeting walter was speaking it cant happen he said the enabling act is a constitutional amendment two thirds of the representatives must be present which would be out of a possible and two thirds of those present must approve lloyd added up the numbers in his head as he put the tray down on the table the nazis had seats and the nationalists who were their close allies had making nearly short walter was right the act could not be passed lloyd was comforted and sat down to listen to the discussion and to improve his german but his relief was shortlived dont be so sure said a man with a workingclass berlin accent the nazis are caucusing with the centre party that was heinrichs lot lloyd recalled that could give them another seventyfour the man finished lloyd frowned why would the centre party support a measure that would take away all its power walter voiced the same thought more bluntly how could the catholics be so stupid lloyd wished he had known about this before he went for coffee then he could have discussed it with heinrich he might have learned something useful damn the man with the berlin accent said in italy the catholics made a deal with mussolini a concordat to protect the church why not here lloyd calculated that the centre partys support would bring the nazis votes up to its still not two thirds he said to walter with relief another young aide heard him and said but that doesnt take into account the reichstag presidents latest announcement the reichstag president was hermann göring hitlers closest associate lloyd had not heard about an announcement nor had anyone else it seemed the deputies went quiet the aide went on he has ruled that communist deputies who are absent because they are in jail dont count there was an outburst of indignant protest all around the room lloyd saw walter go red in the face he cant do that walter said its completely illegal said the aide but he has done it lloyd was dismayed surely the law could not be passed by a trick he did some more arithmetic the communists had seats if they were discounted the nazis needed only two thirds of which was even with the nationalists they still did not have enough but if they won the support of the catholics they could swing it someone said this is all completely illegal we should walk out in protest no no said walter emphatically they would pass the act in our absence weve got to talk the catholics out of it wels must speak to kaas immediately otto wels was the leader of the social democratic party prelate ludwig kaas the head of the centre party there was a murmur of agreement around the room lloyd took a deep breath and spoke up herr von ulrich why dont you take gottfried von kessel to lunch i believe you two worked together in london before the war walter laughed mirthlessly that creep he said maybe the lunch was not such a good idea lloyd said i didnt realize you disliked the man walter looked thoughtful i hate him but ill try anything by god lloyd said shall i find him and extend the invitation all right give it a try if he accepts tell him to meet me at the herrenklub at one very good lloyd hurried back to the room into which heinrich had disappeared he stepped inside a meeting was going on similar to the one he had left he scanned the room spotted the blackclad heinrich met his gaze and beckoned him urgently they both stepped outside then lloyd said theyre saying your party is going to support the enabling act its not certain said heinrich theyre divided whos against the nazis brüning and some others brüning was a former chancellor and a leading figure lloyd felt more hopeful which others did you call me out of the room to pump me for information sorry no i didnt walter von ulrich wants to have lunch with your father heinrich looked dubious they dont like each other you know that dont you i gathered as much but theyll put their differences aside today heinrich did not seem so sure ill ask him wait here he went back inside lloyd wondered whether there was any chance this would work it was a shame walter and gottfried were not bosom buddies but he could hardly believe the catholics would vote with the nazis what bothered him most was the thought that if it could happen in germany it could happen in britain this grim prospect made him shiver with dread he had his whole life in front of him and he did not want to live it in a repressive dictatorship he wanted to work in politics like his parents and make his country a better place for people such as the aberowen coal miners for that he needed political meetings where people could speak their minds and newspapers that could attack the government and pubs where men could have arguments without looking over their shoulders to see who was listening fascism threatened all that but perhaps fascism would fail walter might be able to talk gottfried around and prevent the centre party supporting the nazis heinrich came out hell do it great herr von ulrich suggested the herrenklub at one oclock really is he a member i assume so why its a conservative institution i suppose he is walter von ulrich so he must come from a noble family even if he is a socialist i should probably book a table do you know where it is just around the corner heinrich gave lloyd directions shall i book for four heinrich grinned why not if they dont want you and me they can just ask us to leave he went back into the room lloyd left the building and walked quickly across the plaza passing the burnedout reichstag building and made his way to the herrenklub there were gentlemens clubs in london but lloyd had never been inside one this place was a cross between a restaurant and a funeral parlour he thought waiters in full evening dress padded about laying silent cutlery on tables shrouded in white a head waiter took his reservation and wrote down the name von ulrich as solemnly as if he were making an entry in the book of the dead he returned to the opera house the place was getting busier and noisier and the tension seemed higher lloyd heard someone say excitedly that hitler himself would open the proceedings this afternoon by proposing the act a few minutes before one lloyd and walter walked across the plaza lloyd said heinrich von kessel was surprised to learn that you are a member of the herrenklub walter nodded i was one of the founders a decade or more ago in those days it was the juniklub we got together to campaign against the versailles treaty its become a rightwing bastion and im probably the only social democrat but i remain a member because its a useful place to meet with the enemy inside the club walter pointed to a sleeklooking man at the bar thats ludwig franck the father of young werner who fought alongside us at the peoples theatre walter said im sure hes not a member here he isnt even germanborn but it seems hes having lunch with his fatherinlaw count von der helbard the elderly man beside him come with me they went to the bar and walter performed introductions franck said to lloyd you and my son got into quite a scrap a couple of weeks back lloyd touched the back of his head reflexively the swelling had gone down but the place was still painful to touch we had women to protect sir he said nothing wrong with a bit of a punchup franck said does you lads good walter cut in impatiently come on ludi busting up election meetings is bad enough but your leader wants to completely destroy our democracy perhaps democracy is not the right form of government for us said franck after all were not like the french or the americans thank god dont you care about losing your freedom be serious franck suddenly dropped his facetious air all right walter he said coldly i will be serious if you insist my mother and i arrived here from russia more than ten years ago my father was not able to come with us he had been found to be in possession of subversive literature specifically a book called robinson crusoe apparently a novel that promotes bourgeois individualism whatever the hell that might be he was sent to a prison camp somewhere in the arctic he may francks voice broke for a moment and he paused swallowed and at last finished quietly he may still be there there was a moment of silence lloyd was shocked by the story he knew that the russian communist government could be cruel in general but it was quite another thing to hear a personal account told simply by a man who was clearly still grieving walter said ludi we all hate the bolsheviks but the nazis could be worse im willing to take that risk said franck count von der helbard said wed better go in for lunch ive got an afternoon appointment excuse us the two men left its what they always say walter raged the bolsheviks as if they were the only alternative to the nazis i could weep heinrich walked in with an older man who was obviously his father they had the same thick dark hair combed with a parting except that gottfrieds was shorter and tweeded with silver although their features were similar gottfried looked like a fussy bureaucrat in an oldfashioned collar whereas heinrich was more like a romantic poet than a political aide the four of them went into the dining room walter wasted no time as soon as they had ordered he said i cant understand what your party hopes to gain by supporting this enabling act gottfried von kessel was equally direct we are a catholic party and our first duty is to protect the position of the church in germany thats what people hope for when they vote for us lloyd frowned in disapproval his mother had been a member of parliament and she always said it was her duty to serve the people who did not vote for her as well as those who did walter employed a different argument a democratic parliament is the best protection for all our churches yet youre about to throw that away wake up walter gottfried said testily hitler won the election he has come to power whatever we do hes going to rule germany for the foreseeable future we have to protect ourselves his promises are worth nothing we have asked for specific assurances in writing the catholic church to be independent of the state catholic schools to operate unmolested no discrimination against catholics in the civil service he looked enquiringly at his son heinrich said they promised the agreement would be with us first thing this afternoon walter said weigh the options a scrap of paper signed by a tyrant against a democratic parliament which is better the greatest power of all is god walter rolled his eyes then god save germany he said the germans had not had time to develop faith in democracy lloyd reflected as the argument surged back and forth between walter and gottfried the reichstag had been sovereign for only fourteen years they had lost a war seen their currency devalued to nothing and suffered mass unemployment to them the right to vote seemed inadequate protection gottfried proved immovable at the end of lunch his position was as firm as ever his responsibility was to protect the catholic church it made lloyd want to scream they returned to the opera house and the deputies took their seats in the auditorium lloyd and heinrich sat in a box looking down lloyd could see the social democratic party members in a group on the far left as the hour approached he noticed brownshirts and ss men placing themselves at the exits and around the walls in a threatening arc behind the social democrats it was almost as if they planned to prevent the deputies leaving the building until they had passed the act lloyd found it powerfully sinister he wondered with a shiver of fear whether he too might find himself imprisoned here there was a roar of cheering and applause and hitler walked in wearing a brownshirt uniform the nazi deputies most of them similarly dressed rose to their feet in ecstasy as he mounted the rostrum only the social democrats remained seated but lloyd noticed that one or two looked uneasily over their shoulders at the armed guards how could they speak and vote freely if they were nervous even about not joining in the standing ovation for their opponent when at last they became quiet hitler began to speak he stood straight his left arm at his side gesturing only with his right his voice was harsh and grating but powerful reminding lloyd of both a machine gun and a barking dog his tone thrilled with feeling as he spoke of the november traitors of who had surrendered when germany was about to win the war he was not pretending lloyd felt he sincerely believed every stupid ignorant word he spoke the november traitors were a wellworn topic for hitler but then he took a new tack he spoke of the churches and the important place of the christian religion in the german state this was an unusual theme for him and his words were clearly aimed at the centre party whose votes would determine todays result he said that he saw the two main denominations protestant and catholic as the most important factors for upholding nationhood their rights would not be touched by the nazi government heinrich shot a triumphant look at lloyd id still get it in writing if i were you lloyd muttered it was two and a half hours before hitler reached his peroration he ended with an unmistakable threat of violence the government of the nationalist uprising is determined and ready to deal with the announcement that the act has been rejected and with it that resistance has been declared he paused dramatically letting the message sink in voting against the act would be a declaration of resistance then he reinforced it may you gentlemen now take the decision yourselves as to whether it is to be peace or war he sat down to roars of approval from the nazi delegates and the session was adjourned heinrich was elated lloyd depressed they went off in different directions their parties would now hold desperate lastminute discussions the social democrats were gloomy their leader wels had to speak in the chamber but what could he say several deputies said that if he criticized hitler he might not leave the building alive they feared for their own lives too if the deputies were killed lloyd thought in a moment of cold dread what would happen to their aides wels revealed that he had a cyanide capsule in his waistcoat pocket if arrested he would commit suicide to avoid torture lloyd was horrified wels was an elected representative yet he was forced to behave like some kind of saboteur lloyd had started the day with false expectations he had thought the enabling act a crazy idea that had no chance of becoming reality now he saw that most people expected the act to become a reality today he had misjudged the situation badly was he equally wrong to believe that something like this could not happen in his own country was he fooling himself someone asked if the catholics had made a final decision lloyd stood up ill find out he said he left and ran to the centre partys meeting room as before he put his head around the door and beckoned heinrich outside brüning and ersing are wavering heinrich said lloyds heart sank ersing was a catholic union leader how can a trade unionist even think about voting for this bill he said kaas says the fatherland is in danger they all think there will be bloody anarchy if we reject this act therell be bloody tyranny if you pass it what about your lot they think they will all be shot if they vote against but theyre going to do it anyway heinrich went back inside and lloyd returned to the social democrats the diehards are weakening lloyd told walter and his colleagues theyre afraid of a civil war if the act is rejected the gloom deepened they all returned to the debating chamber at six oclock wels spoke first he was calm reasonable and unemotional he pointed out that life in a democratic republic had been good for germans overall bringing freedom of opportunity and social welfare and reinstating germany as a normal member of the international community lloyd noticed hitler making notes at the end wels bravely professed allegiance to humanity and justice freedom and socialism no enabling law gives you the power to annihilate ideas that are eternal and indestructible he said gaining courage as the nazis began to laugh and jeer the social democrats applauded but they were drowned out we greet the persecuted and oppressed wels shouted we greet our friends in the reich their steadfastness and loyalty deserve admiration lloyd could just make out his words over the hooting and booing of the nazis the courage of their convictions and their unbroken optimism guarantee a brighter future he sat down amid raucous heckling would the speech make any difference lloyd could not tell after wels hitler spoke again this time his tone was quite different lloyd realized that in his earlier speech the chancellor had only been warming up his voice was louder now his phrases more intemperate his tone full of contempt he used his right arm constantly to make aggressive gestures pointing hammering clenching his fist putting his hand on his heart and sweeping the air in a gesture that seemed to brush all opposition aside every impassioned phrase was cheered uproariously by his supporters every sentence expressed the same emotion a savage allconsuming murderous rage hitler was also confident he claimed he had not needed to propose the enabling act we appeal in this hour to the german reichstag to grant us something we would have taken anyway he jeered heinrich looked worried and left the box a minute later lloyd saw him on the floor of the auditorium whispering in his fathers ear when he returned to the box he looked stricken lloyd said have you got your written assurances heinrich could not meet lloyds eye the document is being typed up he replied hitler finished by scorning the social democrats he did not want their votes germany shall be free he screamed but not through you the leaders of the other parties spoke briefly every one appeared crushed prelate kaas said the centre party would support the bill the rest followed suit everyone but the social democrats was in favour the result of the vote was announced and the nazis cheered wildly lloyd was awestruck he had seen naked power brutally wielded and it was an ugly sight he left the box without speaking to heinrich he found walter in the entrance lobby weeping he was using a large white handkerchief to wipe his face but the tears kept coming lloyd had not seen men cry like that except at funerals lloyd did not know what to say or do my life has been a failure walter said this is the end of all hope german democracy is dead vii saturday april was boycott jew day lloyd and ethel walked around berlin staring in incredulity ethel making notes for her book the star of david was crudely daubed on the windows of jewishowned shops brownshirts stood at the doors of jewishowned department stores intimidating people who wanted to go in jewish lawyers and doctors were picketed lloyd happened to see a couple of brownshirts stopping patients going in to see the von ulrichs family physician dr rothmann but then a hardhanded coalheaver with a sprained ankle told the brownshirts to fuck off out of it and they went in search of easier prey how can people be so mean to each other ethel said lloyd was thinking of the stepfather he loved bernie leckwith was jewish if fascism came to britain bernie would be the target of this kind of hatred the thought made lloyd shudder a sort of wake was held at bistro robert that evening apparently no one had organized it but by eight oclock the place was full of social democrats mauds journalistic colleagues and roberts theatrical friends the more optimistic among them said that liberty had merely gone into hibernation for the duration of the economic slump and one day it would awaken the rest just mourned lloyd drank little he did not enjoy the effect of alcohol on his brain it blurred his thinking he was asking himself what german leftwingers could have done to prevent this catastrophe and he did not have an answer maud told them about adas baby kurt shes brought him home from the hospital and he seems to be happy enough for now but his brain is damaged and he will never be normal when hes older he will have to live in an institution poor mite lloyd had heard how the baby had been delivered by elevenyearold carla that little girl had grit commissar thomas macke arrived at half past nine wearing his brownshirt uniform last time he was here robert had treated him as a figure of fun but lloyd had sensed the menace of the man he looked foolish with the little moustache in the middle of his fat face but there was a glint of cruelty in his eyes that made lloyd nervous robert had refused to sell the restaurant what did macke want now macke stood in the middle of the dining area and shouted this restaurant is being used to promote degenerate behaviour the patrons went quiet wondering what this was about macke raised a finger in a gesture that meant youd better listen lloyd felt there was something horribly familiar about the action and realized that macke was mimicking hitler macke said homosexuality is incompatible with the masculine character of the german nation lloyd frowned was he saying that robert was queer jörg came into the restaurant from the kitchen wearing his tall chefs hat he stood by the door glaring at macke lloyd was struck by a shocking thought maybe robert was queer after all he and jörg had been living together since the war looking around at their theatrical friends lloyd noticed that they were all men in pairs except for two women with short hair lloyd felt bewildered he knew that queers existed and as a broadminded person he believed that they should not be persecuted but helped however he thought of them as perverts and creeps robert and jörg seemed like normal men running a business and living quietly almost like a married couple he turned to his mother and said quietly are robert and jörg really yes dear she said maud sitting next to her said robert in his youth was a menace to footmen both women giggled lloyd was doubly shocked not only was robert queer but ethel and maud thought it a matter for lighthearted banter macke said this establishment is now closed robert said you have no right macke could not close the place on his own lloyd thought then he remembered how the brownshirts had crowded on to the stage at the peoples theatre he looked towards the entrance and was aghast to see brownshirts pushing through the door they went around the tables knocking over bottles and glasses some customers sat motionless and watched others got to their feet several men shouted and a woman screamed walter stood up and spoke loudly but calmly we should all leave quietly he said theres no need for any rough stuff everybody just get your coats and hats and go home the customers began to leave some trying to get their coats others just fleeing walter and lloyd ushered maud and ethel towards the door the till was near the exit and lloyd saw a brownshirt open it and begin stuffing money into his pockets until then robert had been standing still watching miserably as a nights business hurried out of the door but this was too much he gave a shout of protest and shoved the brownshirt away from the till the brownshirt punched him knocking him to the floor and began to kick him as he lay there another brownshirt joined in lloyd leaped to roberts rescue he heard his mother shout no as he shoved the brownshirts aside jörg was almost as quick and the two of them bent to help robert up they were immediately attacked by several more brownshirts lloyd was punched and kicked and something heavy hit him over the head as he cried out in pain he thought no not again he turned on his attackers punching with his left and right making every blow connect hard trying to punch through the target as he had been taught he knocked two men down then he was grabbed from behind and thrown off balance a moment later he was on the floor with two men holding him down while a third kicked him then he was rolled over on to his front his arms were pulled behind his back and he felt metal on his wrists he had been handcuffed for the first time in his life he felt a new kind of fear this was not just another roughhouse he had been beaten and kicked but worse was in store get up someone told him in german he struggled to his feet his head hurt robert and jörg were also in handcuffs he saw roberts mouth was bleeding and jörg had one closed eye half a dozen brownshirts were guarding them the rest were drinking from the glasses and bottles left on the tables or standing at the dessert cart stuffing their faces with pastries all the customers seemed to have gone lloyd felt relieved that his mother had got away the restaurant door opened and walter came back in commissar macke he said displaying a typical politicians facility for remembering names with as much authority as he could muster he said what is the meaning of this outrage macke pointed to robert and jörg these two men are homosexuals he said and that boy attacked an auxiliary policeman who was arresting them walter pointed to the till which was open its drawer sticking out and empty except for a few small coins do police officers commit robbery nowadays a customer must have taken advantage of the confusion created by those resisting arrest some of the brownshirts laughed knowingly walter said you used to be a law enforcement officer didn you macke you might have been proud of yourself once but what are you now macke was stung we enforce order to protect the fatherland where are you planning to take your prisoners i wonder walter persisted will it be a properly constituted place of detention or some halfhidden unofficial basement they will be taken to the friedrich strasse barracks macke said indignantly lloyd saw a look of satisfaction pass briefly across walters face and realized that walter had cleverly manipulated macke playing on whatever was left of his professional pride in order to get him to reveal his intentions now at least walter knew where lloyd and the others were being taken but what would happen at the barracks lloyd had never been arrested however he lived in the east end of london so he knew plenty of people who got into trouble with the police most of his life he had played street football with boys whose fathers were arrested frequently he knew the reputation of leman street police station in aldgate few men came out of that building uninjured people said there was blood all over the walls was it likely that the friedrich strasse barracks would be any better walter said this is an international incident commissar lloyd guessed he was using the title in the hope of making macke behave more like an officer and less like a thug you have arrested three foreign citizens two austrians and one englishman he held up a hand as if to fend off a protest it is too late to back out now both embassies are being informed and i have no doubt that their representatives will be knocking on the door of our foreign office in wilhelm strasse within the hour lloyd wondered whether that was true macke grinned unpleasantly the foreign office will not hasten to defend two queers and a young hooligan our foreign minister von neurath is not a member of your party walter said he may well put the interests of the fatherland first i think you will find that he does what hes told and now you are obstructing me in the course of my duty i warn you walter said bravely you had better follow procedure by the book or there will be trouble get out of my sight said macke walter left lloyd robert and jörg were marched outside and bundled into the back of some kind of truck they were forced to lie on the floor while brownshirts sat on benches guarding them the vehicle moved off it was painful being handcuffed lloyd discovered he felt constantly that his shoulder was about to become dislocated the trip was mercifully short they were shoved out of the truck and into a building it was dark and lloyd saw little at a desk his name was written in a book and his passport was taken away robert lost his gold tie pin and watch chain at last the handcuffs were removed and they were pushed into a room with dim lights and barred windows there were about forty other prisoners there already lloyd hurt all over he had a pain in his chest that felt like a cracked rib his face was bruised and he had a blinding headache he wanted an aspirin a cup of tea and a pillow he had a feeling it might be some hours before he got any of those things the three of them sat on the floor near the door lloyd held his head in his hands while robert and jörg discussed how soon help would come no doubt walter would phone a lawyer but all the usual rules had been suspended by the reichstag fire decree so they had no proper protection under the law walter would also contact the embassies political influence was their main hope now lloyd thought his mother would probably try to place an international phone call to the british foreign office in london if she could get through the government would surely have something to say about the arrest of a british schoolboy it would all take time an hour at least probably two or three but four hours passed then five and the door did not open civilized countries had a law about how long the police could keep someone in custody without formalities a charge a lawyer a court lloyd now realized that such a rule was no mere technicality he could be here for ever the other prisoners in the room were all political he discovered communists social democrats trade union organizers and one priest the night passed slowly none of the three slept to lloyd sleep seemed unthinkable the grey light of morning was coming through the barred windows when at last the cell door opened but no lawyers or diplomats came in just two men in aprons pushing a trolley on which stood a large urn they ladled out a thin oatmeal lloyd did not eat any but he drank a tin mug of coffee that tasted of burnt barley he surmised that the staff on duty overnight at the british embassy were junior diplomats who carried little weight this morning as soon as the ambassador himself got up action would be taken an hour after breakfast the door opened again but this time only brownshirts stood there they marched all the prisoners out and loaded them on to a truck forty or fifty men in one canvassided vehicle packed so tightly that they had to remain standing lloyd managed to stay close to robert and jörg perhaps they were going to court even though it was sunday he hoped so at least there would be lawyers and some semblance of due process he thought he was fluent enough to state his simple case in german and he practised his speech in his head he had been dining in a restaurant with his mother he had seen someone robbing the till he had intervened in the resulting fracas he imagined his crossexamination he would be asked if the man he attacked was a brownshirt he would answer i didnt notice his clothing i just saw a thief there would be laughter in court and the prosecutor would look foolish they were driven out of town they could see through gaps in the canvas sides of the truck it seemed to lloyd that they had gone about twenty miles when robert said were in oranienburg naming a small town north of berlin the truck came to a halt outside a wooden gate between brick pillars two brownshirts with rifles stood guard lloyds fear rose a notch where was the court this looked more like a prison camp how could they put people in prison without a judge after a short wait the truck drove in and stopped at a group of derelict buildings lloyd was becoming even more anxious last night at least he had the consolation that walter knew where he was today it was possible no one would know what if the police simply said he was not in custody and they had no record of his arrest how could he be rescued they got out of the truck and shuffled into what looked like a factory of some sort the place smelled like a pub perhaps it had been a brewery once again all their names were taken lloyd was glad there was some record of his movements they were not tied up or handcuffed but they were constantly watched by brownshirts with rifles and lloyd had a grim feeling that those young men were only too eager for an excuse to shoot they were each given a canvas mattress filled with straw and a thin blanket they were herded into a tumbledown building that once might have been a warehouse then the waiting began no one came for lloyd all that day in the evening there was another trolley and another urn this one containing a stew of carrots and turnips each man got a bowlful and a piece of bread lloyd was now ravenous not having eaten for twentyfour hours and he wolfed down his meagre supper and wished for more somewhere in the camp there were three or four dogs that howled all night lloyd felt dirty this was the second night he had spent in the same clothes he needed a bath and a shave and a clean shirt the toilet facilities two barrels in the corner were absolutely disgusting but tomorrow was monday then there would be some action lloyd fell asleep around four at six they were awakened by a brownshirt bawling schleicher jörg schleicher which one is schleicher maybe they were going to be released jörg stood up and said me im schleicher come with me said the brownshirt robert said in a frightened voice why what do you want him for where is he going what are you his mother said the brownshirt lie down and shut your mouth he poked jörg with his rifle outside you watching them go lloyd asked himself why he had not punched the brownshirt and snatched the rifle he might have escaped and if he had failed what would they do to him throw him in jail but at the crucial moment the thought of escape had not even occurred to him was he already taking on the mentality of a prisoner he was even looking forward to the oatmeal before breakfast they were all taken outside they stood around a small wirefenced area a quarter the size of a tennis court it looked as if it might have been used to store something not very valuable timber or tyres perhaps lloyd shivered in the cold morning air his overcoat was still at bistro robert then he saw thomas macke approaching the police detective wore a black coat over his brownshirt uniform he had a heavy flatfooted stride lloyd noticed behind macke were two brownshirts holding the arms of a naked man with a bucket over his head lloyd stared in horror the prisoners hands were tied behind his back and the bucket was tightly tied with string under his chin so that it would not fall off he was a slight youngish man with blond pubic hair robert groaned oh sweet jesus its jörg all the brownshirts in the camp had gathered lloyd frowned what was this some kind of cruel game jörg was led into the fenced compound and left there shivering his two escorts withdrew they disappeared for a few minutes then returned each of them leading two alsatian dogs that explained the allnight barking the dogs were thin with unhealthy bald patches in their tan fur they looked starved the brownshirts led them to the fenced compound lloyd had a vague but dreadful premonition of what was to come robert screamed no he ran forward no no no he tried to open the gate of the compound three or four brownshirts pulled him away roughly he struggled but they were strong young thugs and robert was approaching fifty years old he could not resist them they threw him contemptuously to the ground no said macke to his men make him watch they lifted robert to his feet and held him facing the wire fence the dogs were led into the compound they were excited barking and slavering the two brownshirts handled them expertly and without fear clearly experienced lloyd wondered dismally how many times they had done this before the handlers released the dogs and hurried out of the compound the dogs dashed for jörg one bit his calf another his arm a third his thigh from behind the metal bucket there was a muffled scream of agony and terror the brownshirts cheered and applauded the prisoners looked on in mute horror after the first shock jörg tried to defend himself his hands were tied and he was unable to see but he could kick out randomly however his bare feet made little impact on the starving dogs they dodged and came again ripping his flesh with their sharp teeth he tried running with the dogs at his heels he ran blindly in a straight line until he crashed into the wire fence the brownshirts cheered raucously jörg ran in a different direction with the same result a dog took a chunk out of jörgs behind and they hooted with laughter a brownshirt standing next to lloyd was shouting his tail bite his tail lloyd guessed that tail in german der schwanz was slang for penis the man was hysterical with excitement jörgs white body was now running with blood from multiple wounds he pressed himself up against the wire facefirst protecting his genitals kicking out backwards and sideways but he was weakening his kicks became feeble he was having trouble staying upright the dogs became bolder tearing at him and swallowing bloody chunks at last jörg slid to the ground the dogs settled down to feed the handlers reentered the compound with practised motions they reattached the dogs leads pulled them off jörg and led them away the show was over and the brownshirts began to move away chattering excitedly robert ran into the compound and this time no one stopped him he bent over jörg moaning lloyd helped him to untie jörgs hands and remove the bucket jörg was unconscious but breathing lloyd said lets get him indoors you take his legs lloyd grasped jörg under the arms and the two of them carried him into the building where they had slept they put him on a mattress the other prisoners gathered around frightened and subdued lloyd hoped one of them might announce that he was a doctor but no one did robert stripped off his jacket and waistcoat then took off his shirt and used it to wipe the blood we need clean water he said there was a standpipe in the yard lloyd went out but he had no container he returned to the compound the bucket was still there on the ground he washed it out then filled it with water when he returned the mattress was soaked in blood robert dipped his shirt in the bucket and continued to wash jörgs wounds kneeling beside the mattress soon the white shirt was red jörg stirred robert spoke to him in a low voice be calm my beloved he said its over now and im here but jörg seemed not to hear then macke came in with four or five brownshirts following he grabbed roberts arm and pulled him so he said now you know what we think of homosexual perverts lloyd pointed at jörg and said angrily the pervert is the one who caused this to happen mustering all his rage and contempt he said commissar macke macke gave a slight nod to one of the brownshirts in a movement that was deceptively casual the man reversed his rifle and hit lloyd over the head with the butt lloyd fell to the ground holding his head in agony he heard robert say please just let me look after jörg perhaps said macke first come over here despite his pain lloyd opened his eyes to see what was happening macke pulled robert across the room to a rough wooden table from his pocket he drew a document and a fountain pen your restaurant is now worth half of what i last offered you ten thousand marks anything said robert weeping leave me to be with jörg sign here said macke then the three of you can go home robert signed this gentleman can be a witness macke said he gave the pen to one of the brownshirts he looked across the room and met lloyds eye and perhaps our foolhardy english guest can be the second witness robert said just do what he wants lloyd lloyd struggled to his feet rubbed his sore head took the pen and signed macke pocketed the contract triumphantly and went out robert and lloyd returned to jörg but jörg was dead viii walter and maud came to the lehrte station just north of the burnedout reichstag to see ethel and lloyd off the station building was in the neorenaissance style and looked like a french palace they were early and they sat in a station café while they waited for the train lloyd was glad to be leaving in six weeks he had learned a lot about the german language and about politics but now he wanted to get home tell people what he had seen and warn them against the same thing happening to them all the same he felt strangely guilty about departing he was going to a place where the law ruled the press was free and it was not a crime to be a social democrat he was leaving the von ulrich family to live on in a cruel dictatorship where an innocent man could be torn to pieces by dogs and no one would ever be brought to justice for the crime the von ulrichs looked crushed walter even more than maud they were like people who have heard bad news or suffered a death in the family they seemed unable to think much about anything other than the catastrophe that had happened to them lloyd had been released with profuse apologies from the german foreign ministry and an explanatory statement that was abject yet at the same time mendacious implying that he had got into a brawl through his own foolishness and then had been held prisoner by an administrative error for which the authorities were deeply sorry walter said ive had a telegram from robert hes arrived safely in london as an austrian citizen robert had been able to leave germany without much difficulty getting his money out had been more tricky walter had demanded that macke pay the money to a bank in switzerland at first macke had said that was impossible but walter had put pressure on him threatening to challenge the sale in court saying that lloyd was prepared to testify that the contract had been signed under duress and in the end macke had pulled some strings im glad robert got out lloyd said he would be even happier when he himself was safe in london his head was still tender and he got a pain in his ribs every time he turned over in bed ethel said to maud why dont you come to london both of you the whole family i mean walter looked at maud perhaps we should he said but lloyd could tell that he did not really mean it youve done your best ethel said youve fought bravely but the other side won maud said its not over yet but youre in danger so is germany if you came to live in london fitz might soften his attitude and help you earl fitzherbert was one of the wealthiest men in britain lloyd knew because of the coal mines beneath his land in south wales he wouldnt help me maud said fitz doesnt relent i know that and so do you youre right ethel said lloyd wondered how she could be so sure but he did not get a chance to ask ethel went on well you could easily get a job on a london newspaper with your experience walter said and what would i do in london i dont know ethel said what are you going to do here theres not much point in being an elected representative in an impotent parliament she was being brutally frank lloyd felt but characteristically she was saying what had to be said lloyd sympathized but felt that the von ulrichs should stay i know it will be hard he said but if decent people flee from fascism it will spread all the faster its spreading anyway his mother rejoined maud startled them all by saying vehemently i will not go i absolutely refuse to leave germany they all stared at her im german and have been for fourteen years she said this is my country now but you were born english said ethel a country is mostly the people in it maud said i dont love england my parents died a long time ago and my brother has disowned me i love germany for me germany is my wonderful husband walter my misguided son erik my alarmingly capable daughter carla our maid ada and her disabled son my friend monika and her family my journalistic colleagues im staying to fight the nazis youve already done more than your share ethel said gently mauds tone became emotional my husband has dedicated himself his life his entire being to making this country free and prosperous i will not be the cause of his giving up his lifes work if he loses that he loses his soul ethel pushed the point in a way that only an old friend could still she said there must be a temptation to take your children to safety a temptation you mean a longing a yearning a desperate desire she began to cry carla has nightmares about brownshirts and erik puts on that shitcoloured uniform every chance he gets lloyd was startled by her fervour he had never heard a respectable woman say shit she went on of course i want to take them away lloyd could see how torn she was she rubbed her hands together as if washing them turned her head from side to side in distraction and spoke in a voice that shook violently with her inner conflict but its the wrong thing to do for them as well as for us i will not give in to it better to suffer evil than to stand by and do nothing ethel touched mauds arm im sorry i asked perhaps it was silly of me i might have known you wouldnt run away im glad you asked walter said he reached out and took mauds slim hands in his own the question has been hanging in the air between maud and me unspoken it was time we faced it their joined hands rested on the café table lloyd rarely thought about the emotional lives of his mothers generation they were middleaged and married and that seemed to say it all but now he saw that between walter and maud there was a powerful connection that was much more than the familiar habit of a mature marriage they were under no illusions they knew that by staying here they were risking their lives and the lives of their children but they had a shared commitment that defied death lloyd wondered whether he would ever have such a love ethel looked at the clock oh my goodness she said were going to miss the train lloyd picked up their bags and they hurried across the platform a whistle blew they boarded the train just in time they both leaned out of the window as it pulled out of the station walter and maud stood on the platform waving getting smaller and smaller in the distance until finally they disappeared two things you need to know about girls in buffalo said daisy peshkov they drink like fish and theyre all snobs eva rothmann giggled i dont believe you she said her german accent had almost completely vanished oh its true said daisy they were in her pinkandwhite bedroom trying on clothes in front of a fulllength threeway mirror navy and white might look good on you daisy said what do you think she held a blouse up to evas face and studied the effect the contrasting colours seemed to suit her daisy was looking through her closet for an outfit eva could wear to the beach picnic eva was not a pretty girl and the frills and bows that decorated many of daisys clothes only made eva look frumpy stripes better suited her strong features evas hair was dark and her eyes deep brown you can wear bright colours daisy told her eva had few clothes of her own her father a jewish doctor in berlin had spent his life savings to send her to america and she had arrived a year ago with nothing a charity paid for her to go to daisys boarding school they were the same age nineteen but eva had nowhere to go in the summer vacation so daisy had impulsively invited her home at first daisys mother olga had resisted oh but youre away at school all year i so look forward to having you to myself in the summer shes really great mother daisy had said shes charming and easygoing and a loyal friend i suppose you feel sorry for her because shes a refugee from the nazis i dont care about the nazis i just like her thats fine but does she have to live with us mother she has nowhere else to go as usual olga let daisy have her way in the end now eva said snobs no one would be snobby to you oh yes they would but youre so pretty and vivacious daisy did not bother to deny it they hate that about me and youre rich it was true daisys father was wealthy her mother had inherited a fortune and daisy herself would come into money when she was twentyone it doesnt mean a thing in this town its about how long youve been rich youre nobody if you work the superior people are those who live on the millions left by their greatgrandparents she spoke in a tone of gay mockery to hide the resentment she felt eva said and your father is famous they think hes a gangster daisys grandfather josef vyalov had owned bars and hotels her father lev peshkov had used the profits to buy ailing vaudeville theatres and convert them into cinemas now he owned a hollywood studio too eva was indignant on daisys behalf how can they say such a thing they believe he was a bootlegger theyre probably right i cant see how else he made money out of bars during prohibition anyway thats why mother will never be invited to join the buffalo ladies society they both looked at olga sitting on daisys bed reading the buffalo sentinel in photographs taken when she was young olga was a willowy beauty now she was dumpy and drab she had lost interest in her appearance though she shopped energetically with daisy never caring how much she spent to make her daughter look fabulous olga looked up from the newspaper to say im not sure they mind your father being a bootlegger dear but hes a russian immigrant and on the rare occasions he decides to attend divine service he goes to the russian orthodox church on ideal street thats almost as bad as being catholic eva said its so unfair i might as well warn you that theyre not too fond of jews either daisy said eva was in fact half jewish sorry to be blunt be as blunt as you like after germany this country feels like the promised land dont get too comfortable olga warned according to this paper plenty of american business leaders hate president roosevelt and admire adolf hitler i know thats true because daisys father is one of them politics is boring said daisy isnt there something interesting in the sentinel yes there is muffie dixon is to be presented at the british court good for her daisy said sourly failing to conceal her envy olga read miss muriel dixon daughter of the late charles chuck dixon who was killed in france during the war will be presented at buckingham palace next tuesday by the wife of the united states ambassador mrs robert w bingham daisy had heard enough about muffie dixon ive been to paris but never london she said to eva what about you neither said eva the first time i left germany was when i sailed to america olga suddenly said oh dear whats happened daisy asked her mother crumpled the paper your father took gladys angelus to the white house oh daisy felt as if she had been slapped but he said he would take me president roosevelt had invited a hundred businessmen to a reception in an attempt to win them over to his new deal lev peshkov thought franklin d roosevelt was the next thing to a communist but he had been flattered to be asked to the white house however olga had refused to accompany him saying angrily im not willing to pretend to the president that we have a normal marriage lev officially lived here in the stylish prewar prairie home built by grandfather vyalov but he spent more nights at the swanky downtown apartment where he kept his mistress of many years marga on top of that everyone assumed he was having an affair with his studios biggest star gladys angelus daisy understood why her mother felt spurned daisy too felt rejected when lev drove off to spend his evenings with his other family she had been thrilled when he had asked her to accompany him to the white house instead of her mother she had told everyone she was going none of her friends had met the president except the dewar boys whose father was a senator lev had not told her the exact date and she had assumed that he would let her know at the last minute which was his usual style but he had changed his mind or perhaps just forgotten either way he had rejected daisy again im sorry honey said her mother but promises never did mean much to your father eva was looking sympathetic her pity stung daisy evas father was thousands of miles away and she might never see him again but she felt sorry for daisy as if daisys plight was worse it made daisy feel defiant she would not let this ruin her day well ill be the only girl in buffalo who has been stood up for gladys angelus she said now what shall i wear skirts were dramatically short this year in paris but the conservative buffalo set followed fashion at a distance however daisy had a kneelength tennis dress in a shade of babyblue the same as her eyes maybe today was the day to bring it out she slipped off her dress and put on the new one what do you think she said eva said oh daisy its beautiful but olga said thatll make their eyes pop olga liked it when daisy dressed to kill perhaps it reminded her of her youth eva said daisy if theyre all so snobbish why do you want to go to the party charlie farquharson will be there and im thinking of marrying him daisy said are you serious olga said emphatically hes a great catch eva said whats he like absolutely adorable daisy said not the handsomest boy in buffalo but sweet and kind and rather shy he sounds very different from you its the attraction of opposites olga spoke again the farquharsons are among the oldest families in buffalo eva raised her dark eyebrows snobby very daisy said but charlies father lost all his money in the wall street crash then died killed himself some say so they need to restore the family fortunes eva looked shocked youre hoping hell marry you for your money no hell marry me because i will bewitch him but his mother will accept me for my money you say you will bewitch him does he know about any of this not yet but i think i might make a start this afternoon yes this is definitely the right dress daisy wore the babyblue and eva the navyandwhite stripes by the time they had got ready they were late daisys mother would not have a chauffeur i married my fathers chauffeur and it ruined my life she sometimes said she was terrified daisy might do something similar that was why she was so keen on charlie farquharson if she needed to go anywhere in her creaking stutz she made henry the gardener take off his rubber boots and put on a black suit but daisy had her own car a red chevrolet sport coupe daisy liked driving loved the power and speed of it they headed south out of the city she was almost sorry it was only five or six miles to the beach as she drove she thought about life as charlies wife with her money and his status they would become the leading couple in buffalo society at their dinner parties the table settings would be so elegant that people would gasp in delight they would have the biggest yacht in the harbour and throw onboard parties for other wealthy funloving couples people would yearn for an invitation from mrs charles farquharson no charity function would be a success without daisy and charlie at the top table in her head she watched a movie of herself in a ravishing paris gown walking through a crowd of admiring men and women smiling graciously at their compliments she was still daydreaming when they reached their destination the city of buffalo was in upstate new york near the canadian border woodlawn beach was a mile of sand on the shore of lake erie daisy parked and they walked across the dunes fifty or sixty people were already there these were the adolescent children of the buffalo elite a privileged group who spent their summers sailing and waterskiing in the daytime and going to parties and dances at night daisy greeted the people she knew which was just about everyone and introduced eva around they got glasses of punch daisy tasted it cautiously some of the boys would think it hilarious to spike the drink with a couple of bottles of gin the party was for dot renshaw a sharptongued girl whom no one wanted to marry the renshaws were an old buffalo family like the farquharsons but their fortune had survived the crash daisy made sure to approach the host dots father and thank him im sorry were late she said i lost track of time philip renshaw looked her up and down thats a very short skirt disapproval vied with lasciviousness in his expression im so glad you like it daisy replied pretending he had paid her a straightforward compliment anyway its good that youre here at last he went on a photographer from the sentinel is coming and we must have some pretty girls in the picture daisy muttered to eva so thats why i was invited how kind of him to let me know dot came up she had a thin face with a pointed nose daisy always thought she looked as if she might peck you i thought you were going with your father to meet the president she said daisy felt mortified she wished she had not boasted to everyone about this i see he took his ahem leading lady dot went on unusual that sort of thing in the white house daisy said i guess the president likes to meet movie stars occasionally he deserves a little glamour dont you think i cant imagine that eleanor roosevelt approved according to the sentinel all the other men took their wives how thoughtful of them daisy turned away desperate to escape she spotted charlie farquharson trying to erect a net for beach tennis he was too goodnatured to mock her about gladys angelus how are you charlie she said brightly fine i guess he stood up a tall man of about twentyfive a little overweight stooping slightly as if he feared his height might be intimidating daisy introduced eva charlie was sweetly awkward in company especially with girls but he made an effort and asked eva how she liked america and what she heard from her family back in berlin eva asked him if he was enjoying the picnic not much he said candidly id rather be at home with my dogs no doubt he found pets easier to deal with than girls daisy thought but the mention of dogs was interesting what kind of dogs do you have she asked jack russell terriers daisy made a mental note an angular woman of about fifty approached for goodness sake charlie havent you got that net up yet almost there mom he said nora farquharson was wearing a gold tennis bracelet diamond ear studs and a tiffany necklace more jewellery than she really needed for a picnic the farquharsons poverty was relative daisy reflected they said they had lost everything but mrs farquharson still had a maid and a chauffeur and a couple of horses for riding in the park daisy said good afternoon mrs farquharson this is my friend eva rothmann from berlin how do you do said nora farquharson without offering her hand she felt no need to be friendly towards arriviste russians much less their jewish guests then she seemed to be struck by a thought ah daisy you could go round and find out who wants to play tennis daisy knew she was being treated somewhat as a servant but she decided to be compliant of course she said mixed doubles i suggest good idea mrs farquharson held out a pencil stub and a scrap of paper write the names down daisy smiled sweetly and took a gold pen and a little beige leather notebook from her bag im equipped she knew who the tennis players were good and bad she belonged to the racquet club which was not as exclusive as the yacht club she paired eva with chuck dewar the fourteenyearold son of senator dewar she put joanne rouzrokh with the older dewar boy woody only fifteen but already as tall as his beanpole father naturally she herself would be charlies partner daisy was startled to come across a somewhat familiar face and to recognize her halfbrother greg the son of marga they did not meet often and she had not seen him for a year in that time he seemed to have become a man he was six inches taller and although still only fifteen he had the dark shadow of a beard as a child he had been dishevelled and that had not changed he wore his expensive clothes carelessly the sleeves of the blazer rolled up the striped tie loose at the neck the linen pants seawet and sandy at the cuffs daisy was always embarrassed to run into greg he was a living reminder of how their father had rejected daisy and her mother in favour of greg and marga many married men had affairs she knew but her fathers indiscretion showed up at parties for everyone to see father should have moved marga and greg to new york where nobody knew anybody or to california where no one saw anything wrong with adultery here they were a permanent scandal and greg was part of the reason people looked down on daisy he asked her politely how she was and she answered angry as heck if you want to know fathers let me down again greg said guardedly what did he do asked me to go to the white house with him then took that tart gladys angelus now everyones laughing at me it must have been good publicity for passion her new film you always take his side because he prefers you to me greg looked irritated maybe thats because i admire him instead of complaining about him all the time i dont daisy was about to deny complaining all the time when she realized it was true well maybe i do complain but he should keep his promises shouldnt he he has so much on his mind maybe he shouldnt have two mistresses as well as a wife greg shrugged its a lot to handle they both noticed the unintentional double entendre and after a moment they giggled daisy said well i guess i shouldnt blame you you didnt ask to be born and i should probably forgive you for taking my father away from me three nights a week no matter how i cried and begged him to stay daisy had never thought of it that way in her mind greg was the usurper the illegitimate child who kept stealing her father but now she realized that he felt as hurt as she did she stared at him some girls might find him attractive she guessed he was too young for eva though and he would probably turn out as selfish and unreliable as their father anyway she said do you play tennis he shook his head they dont let people like me into the racquet club he forced an insouciant grin and daisy realized that like her greg felt rejected by buffalo society ice hockeys my sport he said too bad she moved on when she had enough names she returned to charlie who had finally got the net up she sent eva to round up the first foursome then she said to charlie help me make a competition tree they knelt side by side and drew a diagram in the sand with heats semifinals and a final while they were entering the names charlie said do you like the movies daisy wondered if he was about to ask her for a date sure she said have you seen passion by any chance no charlie i havent seen it she said in a tone of exasperation it stars my fathers mistress he was shocked the papers say theyre just good friends and why do you think miss angelus who is barely twenty is so friendly with my fortyyearold father daisy asked sarcastically do you think she likes his receding hairline or his little paunch or his fifty million dollars oh i see said charlie looking abashed sorry you shouldnt be sorry im being kind of bitchy youre not like everyone else you dont automatically think the worst of people i guess im just dumb no youre just nice charlie looked embarrassed but pleased lets get on with this daisy said we have to rig it so that the best players get through to the final nora farquharson reappeared she looked at charlie and daisy kneeling side by side in the sand then studied their drawing charlie said pretty good mom dont you think he longed for approval from her that was obvious very good she gave daisy an appraising look like a mother dog seeing a stranger approach her puppies charlie did most of it daisy said no he didnt mrs farquharson said bluntly her gaze went to charlie and back youre a smart girl she said she looked as if she were about to add something but hesitated what said daisy nothing she turned away daisy stood up i know what she was thinking she murmured to eva what youre a smart girl almost good enough for my son if you came from a better family eva was sceptical you cant know that i sure can and ill marry him if only to prove his mother wrong oh daisy why do you care so much what these people think lets watch the tennis daisy sat on the sand beside charlie he might not be handsome but he would worship his wife and do anything for her the motherinlaw would be a problem but daisy thought she could handle her tall joanne rouzrokh was serving in a white skirt that flattered her long legs her partner woody dewar who was even taller handed her a tennis ball something in the way he looked at joanne made daisy think he was attracted to her maybe even in love with her but he was fifteen and she eighteen so there was no future in that she turned to charlie maybe i should see passion after all she said he did not take the hint maybe you should he said indifferently the moment had passed daisy turned to eva i wonder where i could buy a jack russell terrier ii lev peshkov was the best father a guy could have or at least he would have been if he had been around more he was rich and generous he was smarter than anybody he was even well dressed he had probably been handsome when he was younger and even now women threw themselves at him greg peshkov adored him and his only complaint was that he did not see enough of him i should have sold this fucking foundry when i had the chance lev said as they walked around the silent deserted factory it was losing money even before the goddamned strike i should stick to cinemas and bars he wagged a didactic finger people always buy booze in good times and bad and they go to the movies even when they cant afford to never forget that greg was pretty sure his father did not often make mistakes in business so why did you keep it he said sentiment lev replied when i was your age i worked in a place like this the putilov machine factory in st petersburg he looked around at the furnaces moulds hoists lathes and workbenches actually it was a lot worse the buffalo metal works made fans of all sizes including huge propellers for ships greg was fascinated by the mathematics of the curved blades he was top of his class in math were you an engineer he asked lev grinned i tell people that if i need to impress them he said but the truth is i looked after the horses i was a stable boy i was never good with machines that was my brother grigoris talent you take after him all the same never buy a foundry i wont greg was to spend the summer shadowing his father learning the business lev had just got back from los angeles and gregs lessons had begun today but he did not want to know about the foundry he was good at math but he was interested in power he wished his father would take him on one of his frequent trips to washington to lobby for the movie industry that was where the real decisions were made he was looking forward to lunch he and his father were to meet senator gus dewar greg wanted to ask a favour of senator dewar however he had not yet cleared this with his father he was nervous about asking and instead he said do you ever hear of your brother in leningrad lev shook his head not since the war i wouldnt be surprised if hes dead a lot of old bolsheviks have disappeared speaking of family i saw my halfsister on saturday she was at the beach picnic did you have a good time shes mad at you did you know that what have i done now you said youd take her to the white house then you took gladys angelus thats true i forgot but i wanted the publicity for passion they were approached by a tall man whose striped suit was loud even by current fashions he touched the brim of his fedora and said morning boss lev said to greg joe brekhunov is in charge of security here joe this is my son greg pleased to meet ya said brekhunov greg shook his hand like most factories the foundry had its own police force but brekhunov looked more like a hoodlum than a cop all quiet lev asked a little incident in the night brekhunov said two machinists tried to heist a length of fifteeninch steel bar aircraft quality we caught them trying to manhandle it over the fence greg said did you call the police it wasnt necessary brekhunov grinned we gave them a little talk about the concept of private property and sent them to the hospital to think about it greg was not surprised to learn that his fathers security men beat thieves so badly that they had to go to hospital although lev had never struck him or his mother greg felt that violence was never far below his fathers charming surface it was because of levs youth in the slums of leningrad he guessed a portly man wearing a blue suit with a workingmans cap appeared from behind a furnace this is the union leader brian hall said lev morning hall morning peshkov greg raised his eyebrows people usually called his father mr peshkov lev stood with his feet apart and his hands on his hips well have you got an answer for me halls face took on a stubborn expression the men wont come back to work with a pay cut if thats what you mean but ive improved my offer its still a pay cut greg began to feel nervous his father did not like opposition and he might explode the manager tells me we arent getting any orders because he cant tender a competitive price at these wage levels thats because youve got outdated machinery peshkov some of these lathes were here before the war you need to reequip in the middle of a depression are you out of your mind im not going to throw away more money thats how your men feel said hall with the air of one who plays a trump card theyre not going to give money to you when they havent got enough for themselves greg thought workers were stupid to strike during a depression and he was angered by halls nerve the man spoke as if he were levs equal not an employee lev said well as things are were all losing money wheres the sense in that its out of my hands now said hall greg thought he sounded smug the union is sending a team from headquarters to take over he pulled a large steel watch out of his waistcoat pocket their train should be here in an hour levs face darkened we dont need outsiders stirring up trouble if you dont want trouble you shouldnt provoke it lev clenched a fist but hall walked away lev turned to brekhunov did you know about these men from headquarters he said angrily brekhunov looked nervous ill get on it right away boss find out who they are and where theyre staying wont be difficult then send them back to new york in a fucking ambulance leave it to me boss lev turned away and greg followed him now that was power greg thought with a touch of awe his father gave the word and union officials would be beaten up they walked outside and got into levs car a cadillac fivepassenger sedan in the new streamlined style its long curving fenders made greg think of a girls hips lev drove along porter avenue to the waterfront and parked at the buffalo yacht club sunlight played prettily on the boats in the marina greg was pretty sure that his father did not belong to this elite club gus dewar must be a member they walked on to the pier the clubhouse was built on pilings over the water lev and greg went inside and checked their hats greg immediately felt uneasy knowing he was a guest in a club that would not have him as a member the people here probably thought he must feel privileged to be allowed in he put his hands in his pockets and slouched so they would know he was not impressed i used to belong to this club lev said but in the chairman told me i had to resign because i was a bootlegger then he asked me to sell him a case of scotch why does senator dewar want to have lunch with you greg asked were about to find out would you mind if i asked him a favour lev frowned i guess not what are you after but before greg could answer lev greeted a man of about sixty this is dave rouzrokh he said to greg hes my main rival you flatter me the man said roseroque theatres was a chain of dilapidated movie houses in new york state the owner was anything but decrepit he had a patrician air he was tall and whitehaired with a nose like a curved blade he wore a blue cashmere blazer with the badge of the club on the breast pocket greg said i had the pleasure of watching your daughter joanne play tennis on saturday dave was pleased pretty good isnt she very lev said im glad i ran into you dave i was planning to call you why your theatres need remodelling theyre very oldfashioned dave looked amused you were planning to call me to give me this news why dont you do something about it he shrugged elegantly why bother im making enough money at my age i dont want the strain you could double your profits by raising ticket prices no thanks youre crazy not everyone is obsessed with money dave said with a touch of disdain then sell to me lev said greg was surprised he had not seen that coming ill give you a good price lev added dave shook his head i like owning cinemas he said they give people pleasure eight million dollars lev said greg felt bemused he thought did i just hear father offer dave eight million dollars that is a fair price dave admitted but im not selling no one else will give you as much lev said with exasperation i know dave looked as if he had taken enough browbeating he swallowed the rest of his drink nice to see you both he said and he strolled out of the bar into the dining room lev looked disgusted not everyone is obsessed with money he quoted daves greatgrandfather arrived here from persia a hundred years ago with nothing but the clothes he wore and six rugs he wouldnt have turned down eight million dollars i didnt know you had that much money greg said i dont not in ready cash thats what banks are for so youd take out a loan to pay dave lev raised his forefinger again never use your own money when you can spend someone elses gus dewar walked in a tall figure with a large head he was in his midforties and his lightbrown hair was salted with silver he greeted them with cool courtesy shaking hands and offering them a drink greg saw immediately that gus and lev did not like one another he feared that would mean gus would not grant the favour greg wanted to beg maybe he should give up the thought gus was a big shot his father had been a senator before him a dynastic succession that greg thought was unamerican gus had helped franklin roosevelt become governor of new york and then president now he was on the powerful senate foreign relations committee his sons woody and chuck went to the same school as greg woody was brainy chuck was a sportsman lev said has the president told you to settle my strike senator gus smiled no not yet anyway lev turned to greg last time the foundry was on strike twenty years ago president wilson sent gus to browbeat me into giving the men a raise i saved you money gus said mildly they were asking for a dollar i made them take half that which was exactly fifty cents more than i intended to give gus smiled and shrugged shall we have lunch they went into the dining room when they had ordered gus said the president was glad you could make it to the reception at the white house i probably shouldnt have taken gladys lev said mrs roosevelt was a bit frosty with her i guess she doesnt approve of movie stars she probably doesnt approve of movie stars who sleep with married men greg thought but he kept his mouth shut gus made small talk while they ate greg looked for an opportunity to ask his favour he wanted to work in washington one summer to learn the ropes and make contacts his father might have been able to get him an internship but it would have been with a republican and they were out of power greg wanted to work in the office of the influential and respected senator dewar personal friend and ally of the president he asked himself why he was nervous about asking the worst that could happen was that dewar would say no when the dessert was finished gus got down to business the president has asked me to speak to you about the liberty league he said greg had heard of this organization a rightwing group opposed to the new deal lev lit a cigarette and blew out smoke we have to guard against creeping socialism the new deal is all that is saving us from the kind of nightmare theyre having in germany the liberty league arent nazis arent they they have a plan for an armed insurrection to overthrow the president its not realistic of course not yet anyway i believe i have a right to my opinions then youre supporting the wrong people the league is nothing to do with liberty you know dont talk to me about liberty lev said with a touch of anger when i was twelve years old i was flogged by the leningrad police because my parents were on strike greg was not sure why his father had said that the brutality of the tsars regime seemed like an argument for socialism not against gus said roosevelt knows you give money to the league and he wants you to stop how does he know who i give money to the fbi told him they investigate such people were living in a police state youre supposed to be a liberal there was not much logic to levs arguments greg perceived lev was just trying everything he could think of to wrongfoot gus and he did not care if he contradicted himself in the process gus remained cool im trying to make sure this doesnt become a matter for the police he said lev grinned does the president know i stole your fiancée this was news to greg but it had to be true for lev had at last succeeded in throwing gus off balance gus looked shocked turned his gaze aside and reddened score one for our team greg thought lev explained to greg gus was engaged to olga back in he said then she changed her mind and married me gus recovered his composure we were all terribly young lev said you certainly got over olga quickly enough gus gave lev a cool look and said so did you greg saw that his father was embarrassed now guss shot had hit home there was a moment of awkward silence then gus said you and i fought in a war lev i was in a machinegun battalion with my school friend chuck dixon in a little french town called châteauthierry he was blown to pieces in front of my eyes gus was speaking in a conversational tone but greg found himself holding his breath gus went on my ambition for my sons is that they should never have to go through what we went through thats why groups such as the liberty league have to be nipped in the bud greg saw his chance im interested in politics too senator and id like to learn more might you be able to take me as an intern one summer he held his breath gus looked surprised but said i can always use a bright young man whos willing to work in a team that was neither a yes nor a no im top in math and captain of ice hockey greg persisted selling himself ask woody about me i will gus turned to lev and will you consider the presidents request its really very important it almost seemed as if gus was suggesting an exchange of favours but would lev agree lev hesitated a long moment then stubbed out his cigarette and said i guess we have a deal gus stood up good he said the president will be pleased greg thought i did it they walked out of the club to their cars as they drove out of the parking lot greg said thank you father i really appreciate what you did you chose your moment well lev said im glad to see youre so smart the compliment pleased greg in some ways he was smarter than his father he certainly understood science and math better but he feared he was not as shrewd and cunning as his old man i want you to be a wise guy lev went on not like some of these dummies greg had no idea who the dummies were youve got to stay ahead of the curve all the time thats the way to get on lev drove to his office in a modern block downtown as they walked through the marble lobby lev said now im going to teach a lesson to that fool dave rouzrokh going up in the elevator greg wondered how lev would do that peshkov pictures occupied the top floor greg followed lev along a broad corridor and through an outer office with two attractive young secretaries get sol starr on the phone will you lev said as they walked into the inner office lev sat behind the desk solly owns one of the biggest studios in hollywood he explained the phone on the desk rang and lev picked it up sol he said how are they hanging greg listened to a minute or two of masculine joshing then lev got down to business little piece of advice he said here in new york state we have a crappy chain of fleapits called roseroque theatres yeah thats the one take my tip dont send them your topoftheline firstrun pictures this summer you may not get paid greg realized that would hit dave hard without exciting new movies to show his takings would tumble a word to the wise right solly dont thank me youd do the same for me bye once again greg was awestruck by his fathers power he could have people beaten up he could offer eight million dollars of other peoples money he could scare a president he could seduce another mans fiancée and he could ruin a business with a single phone call you wait and see said his father in a months time dave rouzrokh will be begging me to buy him out at half the price i offered him today iii i dont know whats wrong with this puppy daisy said he wont do anything i tell him im going crazy there was a shake in her voice and a tear in her eye and she was exaggerating only a little charlie farquharson studied the dog theres nothing wrong with him he said hes a lovely little fellow whats his name jack hmm they were sitting on lawn chairs in the wellkept twoacre garden of daisys home eva had greeted charlie then tactfully retired to write a letter home the gardener henry was hoeing a bed of purple and yellow pansies in the distance his wife ella the maid brought a pitcher of lemonade and some glasses and set them on a folding table the puppy was a tiny jack russell terrier small and strong white with tan patches he had an intelligent look as if he understood every word but he seemed to have no inclination to obey daisy held him on her lap and stroked his nose with dainty fingers in a way that she hoped charlie would find strangely disturbing dont you like the name a bit obvious perhaps charlie stared at her white hand on the dogs nose and shifted uneasily in his chair daisy did not want to overdo it if she inflamed charlie too much he would just go home this was why he was still single at twentyfive several buffalo girls including dot renshaw and muffie dixon had found it impossible to nail his foot to the floor but daisy was different then you shall name him she said its good to have two syllables as in bonzo to make it easier for him to recognize the name daisy had no idea how to name dogs how about rover too common rusty might be better perfect she said rusty he shall be the dog wriggled effortlessly out of her grasp and jumped to the ground charlie picked him up daisy noticed he had big hands you must show rusty youre the boss charlie said hold him tight and dont let him jump down until you say so he put the dog back on her lap but hes so strong and im afraid of hurting him charlie smiled condescendingly you probably couldnt hurt him if you tried hold his collar tightly twist it a bit if you need to then put your other hand firmly on his back daisy followed charlies orders the dog sensed the increased pressure in her touch and became still as if waiting to see what would happen next tell him to sit then press down on his rear end sit she said say it louder and pronounce the letter t very clearly then press down hard sit rusty she said and pushed him down he sat there you are said charlie youre so clever daisy gushed charlie looked pleased its just a matter of knowing what to do he said modestly you must always be emphatic and decisive with dogs you have to almost bark at them he sat back looking content he was quite heavy and filled the chair talking about the subject in which he was expert had relaxed him as daisy had hoped she had called him that morning im in despair she had said i have a new puppy and i cant manage him at all can you give me any advice what breed of puppy its a jack russell why thats the kind of dog i like best i have three what a coincidence as daisy had hoped charlie volunteered to come over and help her train the dog eva had said doubtfully do you really think charlie is right for you are you kidding daisy had replied hes one of the most eligible bachelors in buffalo now daisy said to charlie i bet youd be really good with children too oh i dont know about that you love dogs but youre firm with them im sure that works with children too i have no idea he changed the subject are you intending to go to college in september i might go to oakdale its a twoyear finishing college for ladies unless unless what unless i get married she meant but she said i dont know unless something else happens such as what id like to see england my father went to london and met the prince of wales what about you any plans it was always assumed that i would take over fathers bank but now there is no bank mother has a little money from her family and i manage that but otherwise im kind of a loose wheel you should raise horses daisy said i know youd be good at it she was a good rider and had won prizes when younger she pictured herself and charlie in the park on matching greys with two children on ponies following behind the vision gave her a warm glow i love horses charlie said so do i i want to breed racehorses daisy did not have to feign this enthusiasm it was her dream to raise a string of champions she saw racehorse owners as the ultimate international elite thoroughbreds cost a lot of money charlie said lugubriously daisy had plenty if charlie married her he would never have to worry about money again she naturally did not say so but she guessed that charlie was thinking it and she let the thought hang unspoken in the air for as long as possible eventually charlie said did your father really have those two union organizers beaten up what a strange idea daisy did not know whether lev peshkov had done any such thing but in truth it would not have surprised her the men who came from new york to take over the strike charlie persisted they were hospitalized the sentinel says they quarrelled with local union leaders but everyone thinks your father was responsible i never talk about politics daisy said gaily when did you get your first dog charlie began a long reminiscence daisy considered what to do next ive got him here she thought and ive put him at ease now i have to get him aroused but stroking the dog suggestively had unnerved him what they needed was some casual physical contact what should i do next with rusty she asked when charlie had finished his story teach him to walk to heel charlie said promptly how do you do that do you have some dog biscuits sure the kitchen windows were open and daisy raised her voice so that the maid could hear her ella would you kindly bring me that box of milkbones charlie broke up one of the biscuits then took the dog on his lap he held a piece of biscuit in his closed fist letting rusty sniff it then opened his hand and allowed the dog to eat the morsel he took another piece making sure the dog knew he had it then he stood up and put the dog at his feet rusty kept an alert gaze on charlies closed fist walk to heel charlie said and walked a few steps the dog followed him good boy charlie said and gave rusty the biscuit thats amazing daisy said after a while you wont need the biscuit hell do it for a pat then eventually hell do it automatically charlie you are a genius charlie looked pleased he had nice brown eyes just like the dog she observed now you try he said to daisy she copied what charlie had done and achieved the same result see said charlie its not so hard daisy laughed with delight we should go into business she said farquharson and peshkov dog trainers what a nice idea he said and he seemed to mean it this was going very well daisy thought she went to the table and poured two glasses of lemonade standing beside her he said im usually a bit shy with girls no kidding she thought but she kept her mouth firmly closed but youre so easy to talk to he went on he imagined that was a happy accident as she handed a glass to him she fumbled spilling lemonade on him oh how clumsy she cried its nothing he said but the drink had wet his linen blazer and his white cotton trousers he pulled out a handkerchief and began to mop it here let me said daisy and she took the handkerchief from his large hand she moved intimately close to pat his lapel he went still and she knew he could smell her jean naté perfume lavender notes on top musk underneath she brushed the handkerchief caressingly over the front of his jacket though there was no spill there almost done she said as if she regretted having to stop soon then she went down on one knee as if worshipping him she began to blot the wet patches on his pants with butterfly lightness as she stroked his thigh she put on a look of alluring innocence and looked up he was staring down at her breathing hard through his open mouth mesmerized iv woody dewar impatiently inspected the yacht sprinter checking that the kids had made everything shipshape she was a fortyeightfoot racing ketch long and slender like a knife dave rouzrokh had loaned her to the shipmates a club woody belonged to that took the sons of buffalos unemployed out on lake erie and taught them the rudiments of sailing woody was glad to see that the dock lines and fenders were set the sails furled the halyards tied off and all the other lines neatly coiled his brother chuck a year younger at fourteen was on the dock already joshing with a couple of coloured kids chuck had an easygoing manner that enabled him to get on with everyone woody who wanted to go into politics like their father envied chucks effortless charm the boys wore nothing but shorts and sandals and the three on the dock looked a picture of youthful strength and vitality woody would have liked to have taken a photograph if he had had his camera with him he was a keen photographer and had built a darkroom at home so that he could develop and print his own pictures satisfied that the sprinter was being left as they had found her this morning woody jumped on to the dock a group of a dozen youngsters left the boatyard together windswept and sunburned aching pleasantly from their exertions laughing as they relived the days blunders and pratfalls and jokes the gap between the two rich brothers and the crowd of poor boys had vanished when they were out on the water working together to control the yacht but now it reappeared in the parking lot of the buffalo yacht club two vehicles stood side by side senator dewars chrysler airflow with a uniformed chauffeur at the wheel for woody and chuck and a chevrolet roadster pickup truck with two wooden benches in the back for the others woody felt embarrassed saying goodbye as the chauffeur held the door for him but the boys did not seem to care thanking him and saying see you next saturday as they drove up delaware avenue woody said that was fun though im not sure how much good it does chuck was surprised why well were not helping their fathers find jobs and thats the only thing that really counts it might help the sons get work in a few years time buffalo was a port city in normal times there were thousands of jobs on merchant ships plying the great lakes and the erie canal as well as on pleasure craft provided the president can get the economy moving again chuck shrugged so go work for roosevelt why not papa worked for woodrow wilson ill stick with the sailing woody checked his wristwatch weve got time to change for the ball just they were going to a dinnerdance at the racquet club anticipation made his heart beat faster i want to be with humans that have soft skin speak with high voices and wear pink dresses huh chuck said derisively joanne rouzrokh never wore pink in her life woody was taken aback he had been dreaming about joanne all day and half the night for a couple of weeks but how did his brother know that what makes you think oh come on chuck said scornfully when she arrived at the beach party in a tennis skirt you practically fainted everyone could see you were crazy about her fortunately she didnt seem to notice why was that fortunate for gods sake youre fifteen and shes eighteen its embarrassing shes looking for a husband not a schoolboy oh gee thanks i forgot what an expert you are on women chuck flushed he had never had a girlfriend you dont have to be an expert to see whats under your goddamn nose they talked like this all the time there was no malice in it they were just brutally frank with each other they were brothers so there was no need to be nice they reached home a mockgothic mansion built by their late grandfather senator cam dewar they ran inside to shower and change woody was now the same height as his father and he put on one of papas old dress suits it was a bit worn but that was all right the younger boys would be wearing school suits or blazers but the college men would have tuxedos and woody was keen to look older tonight he would dance with her he thought as he slicked his hair with brilliantine he would be allowed to hold her in his arms the palms of his hands would feel the warmth of her skin he would look into her eyes as she smiled her breasts would brush against his jacket as they danced when he came down his parents were waiting in the drawing room papa drinking a cocktail mama smoking a cigarette papa was long and thin and looked like a coathanger in his doublebreasted tuxedo mama was beautiful despite having only one eye the other being permanently closed she had been born that way tonight she looked stunning in a floorlength dress black lace over red silk and a short black velvet evening jacket woodys grandmother was the last to arrive at sixtyeight she was poised and elegant as thin as her son but petite she studied mamas dress and said rosa dear you look wonderful she was always kind to her daughterinlaw to everyone else she was waspish gus made her a cocktail without being asked woody hid his impatience while she took her time drinking it grandmama could never be hurried she assumed no social event would begin before she arrived she was the grand old lady of buffalo society widow of a senator and mother of another matriarch of one of the citys oldest and most distinguished families woody asked himself when he had fallen for joanne he had known her most of his life but he had always regarded girls as uninteresting spectators to the exciting adventures of boys until two or three years ago when girls had suddenly become even more fascinating than cars and speedboats even then he had been more interested in girls his own age or a little younger joanne for her part had always treated him as a kid a bright kid worth talking to now and again but certainly not a possible boyfriend but this summer for no reason he could put a finger on he had suddenly begun to see her as the most alluring girl in the world sadly her feelings for him had not undergone a similar transformation not yet grandmama addressed a question to his brother how is school chuck terrible grandmama as you know perfectly well im the family cretin a throwback to our chimpanzee forbears cretins dont use phrases such as our chimpanzee forbears in my experience are you quite sure laziness plays no part rosa butted in chucks teachers say he works pretty hard at school mama gus added and he beats me at chess then i ask what the problem is grandmama persisted if this goes on he wont get into harvard chuck said im a slow reader thats all curious she said my fatherinlaw your paternal greatgrandfather was the most successful banker of his generation yet he could barely read or write chuck said i didnt know that its true she said but dont use it as an excuse work harder gus looked at his watch if youre ready mama wed better go at last they got into the car and drove to the club papa had taken a table for the dinner and had invited the renshaws and their offspring dot and george woody looked around but to his disappointment he did not see joanne he checked the table plan on an easel in the lobby and was dismayed to see that there was no rouzrokh table were they not coming that would ruin his evening the talk over the lobster and steak was of events in germany philip renshaw thought hitler was doing a good job woodys father said according to todays sentinel they jailed a catholic priest for criticizing the nazis are you catholic asked mr renshaw in surprise no episcopalian its not about religion philip said rosa crisply its about freedom woodys mother had been an anarchist in her youth and she was still a libertarian at heart some people skipped the dinner and came later for the dancing and more revellers appeared as the dewars were served dessert woody kept his eyes peeled for joanne in the next room a band started to play the continental a hit from last year he could not say what it was about joanne that had so captivated him most people would not call her a great beauty though she was certainly striking she looked like an aztec queen with high cheekbones and the same knifeblade nose as her father dave her hair was dark and thick and her skin an olive shade no doubt because of her persian ancestry there was a brooding intensity about her that made woody long to know her better to make her relax and hear her murmur softly about nothing in particular he felt that her formidable presence must signify a capacity for deep passion then he thought now whos pretending to be an expert on women are you looking out for someone woody said grandmama who did not miss much chuck sniggered knowingly just wondering whos coming to the dance woody replied casually but he could not help blushing he still had not spotted her when his mother stood up and they all left the table disconsolate he wandered into the ballroom to the strains of benny goodmans moonglow and there joanne was she must have come in when he wasnt looking his spirits lifted tonight she wore a dramatically simple silvergrey silk dress with a deep vneck that showed off her figure she had looked sensational in a tennis skirt that revealed her long brown legs but this was even more arousing as she glided across the room graceful and confident she made woodys throat go dry he moved towards her but the ballroom had filled up and suddenly he was irritatingly popular everyone wanted to talk to him during his progress through the crowd he was surprised to see dull old charlie farquharson dancing with the vivacious daisy peshkov he could not recall seeing charlie dance with anyone let alone a tootsie like daisy what had she done to bring him out of his shell by the time he reached joanne she was at the end of the room farthest from the band and to his chagrin she was deep in discussion with a group of boys four or five years older than he fortunately he was taller than most of them so the difference was not too obvious they were all holding coke glasses but woody could smell scotch one of them must have a bottle in his pocket as he joined them he heard victor dixon say no ones in favour of lynching but you have to understand the problems they have in the south woody knew that senator wagner had proposed a law to punish sheriffs who permitted lynchings but president roosevelt had refused to back the bill joanne was outraged how can you say that victor lynching is murder we dont have to understand their problems we have to stop them killing people woody was pleased to learn how much joanne shared his political values but clearly this was not a good time to ask her to dance which was unfortunate you dont get it joanne honey said victor those southern negroes are not really civilized i might be young and inexperienced woody thought but i wouldnt have made the mistake of speaking so condescendingly to joanne its the people who carry out lynchings who are uncivilized she said woody decided this was the moment to make his contribution to the argument joanne is right he said he made his voice lower in pitch to sound older there was a lynching in the home town of our help joe and betty who have looked after me and my brother since we were babies bettys cousin was stripped naked and burned with a blowtorch while a crowd watched then he was hanged victor glared at him resentful of this kid who was taking joannes attention away but the others in the group listened with horrified interest i dont care what his crime was woody said the white people who did that to him are savages victor said your beloved president roosevelt didnt support the antilynch bill though did he no and that was very disappointing said woody i know why he made that decision he was afraid that angry southern congressmen would retaliate by sabotaging the new deal all the same i would have liked him to tell them to go to hell victor said what do you know youre just a kid he took a silver flask from his jacket pocket and topped up his drink joanne said woodys political ideas are more grownup than yours victor woody glowed politics is kind of the family business he said then he was irritated by a tug at his elbow too polite to ignore it he turned to see charlie farquharson perspiring from his exertions on the dance floor can i talk to you for a minute said charlie woody resisted the temptation to tell him to buzz off charlie was a likeable guy who did no harm to anyone you had to feel sorry for a man with a mother like that what is it charlie he said with as much good grace as he could muster its about daisy i saw you dancing with her isnt she a great dancer woody had not noticed but to be nice he said you bet she is shes great at everything charlie said woody trying to suppress a tone of incredulity are you and daisy courting charlie looked bashful weve been horse riding in the park a couple of times and so on so you are courting woody was surprised they seemed an unlikely pair charlie was such a lump and daisy was a poppet charlie added shes not like other girls shes so easy to talk to and she loves dogs and horses but people think her father is a gangster i guess he is a gangster charlie everyone bought their liquor from him during prohibition thats what my mother says so your mother doesnt like daisy woody was not surprised she likes daisy fine its daisys family she objects to an even more surprising thought occurred to woody are you thinking of marrying daisy oh god yes said charlie and i think she might say yes if i asked her well woody thought charlie had class but no money and daisy was the opposite so maybe they would complement one another stranger things have happened he said this was kind of fascinating but he wanted to concentrate on his own romantic life he looked around checking that joanne was still there why are you telling me this he asked charlie it was not as if they were great friends my mother might change her mind if mrs peshkov were invited to join the buffalo ladies society woody had not been expecting that why its the snobbiest club in town exactly if olga peshkov were a member how could mom object to daisy woody did not know whether this scheme would work or not but there was no doubting the earnest warmth of charlies feelings maybe youre right woody said would you approach your grandmother for me whoa wait a minute grandmama dewar is a dragon i wouldnt ask her for a favour for myself let alone for you woody listen to me you know shes really the boss of that little clique if she wants someone theyre in and if she doesnt theyre out this was true the society had a chairwoman and a secretary and a treasurer but ursula dewar ran the club as if it belonged to her all the same woody was reluctant to petition her she might bite his head off i dont know he said apologetically oh come on woody please you dont understand charlie lowered his voice you dont know what its like to love someone this much yes i do woody thought and that changed his mind if charlie feels as bad as i do how can i refuse him i hope someone else would do the same for me if it meant i had a better chance with joanne okay charlie he said ill talk to her thanks say shes here isnt she could you do it tonight hell no ive got other things on my mind okay sure but when woody shrugged ill do it tomorrow youre a pal dont thank me yet shell probably say no woody turned back to speak to joanne but she had gone he began to look for her then stopped himself he must not appear desperate a needy man was not sexy he knew that much he danced dutifully with several girls dot renshaw daisy peshkov and daisys german friend eva he got a coke and went outside to where some of the boys were smoking cigarettes george renshaw poured some scotch into woodys coke which improved the taste but he did not want to get drunk he had done that before and he did not like it joanne would want a man who shared her intellectual interests woody believed and that would rule out victor dixon woody had heard joanne mention karl marx and sigmund freud in the public library he had read the communist manifesto but it just seemed like a political rant he had had more fun with freuds studies in hysteria which made a kind of detective story out of mental illness he was looking forward to letting joanne know in a casual way that he had read these books he was determined to dance with joanne at least once tonight and after a while he went in search of her she was not in the ballroom or the bar had he missed his chance in trying not to show his desperation had he been too passive it was unbearable to think that the ball could end without his even having touched her shoulder he stepped outside again it was dark but he saw her almost immediately she was walking away from greg peshkov looking a little flushed as if she had been arguing with him you might be the only person here who isnt a goddamned conservative she said to woody she sounded a little drunk woody smiled thanks for the compliment i think do you know about the march tomorrow she asked abruptly he did strikers from the buffalo metal works planned a demonstration to protest against the beating up of union men from new york woody guessed that was the subject of her argument with greg his father owned the factory i was planning to go he said i might take some photographs bless you she said and she kissed him he was so surprised that he almost failed to respond for a second he stood there passively as she crushed her mouth to his and he tasted whisky on her lips then he recovered his composure he put his arms around her and pressed her body to his feeling her breasts and her thighs press delightfully against him part of him feared she would be offended push him away and angrily accuse him of treating her disrespectfully but a deeper instinct told him he was on safe ground he had little experience of kissing girls and none of kissing mature women of eighteen but he liked the feel of her soft mouth so much that he moved his lips against hers in little nibbling motions that gave him exquisite pleasure and he was rewarded by hearing her moan quietly he was vaguely aware that if one of the older generation should walk by there might be an embarrassing scene but he was too aroused to care joannes mouth opened and he felt her tongue this was new to him the few girls he had kissed had not done that but he figured she must know what she was doing and anyway he really liked it he imitated the motions of her tongue with his own it was shockingly intimate and highly exciting it must have been the right thing to do because she moaned again summoning his nerve he put his right hand on her left breast it was wonderfully soft and heavy under the silk of her dress as he caressed it he felt a small protuberance and thought with a thrill of discovery that it must be her nipple he rubbed it with his thumb she pulled away from him abruptly good god she said what am i doing youre kissing me woody said happily he rested his hands on her round hips he could feel the heat of her skin through the silk dress lets do it some more she pushed his hands away i must be out of my mind this is the racquet club for christs sake woody could see that the spell had been broken and sadly there would be no more kissing tonight he looked around dont worry he said no one saw he felt enjoyably conspiratorial id better go home before i do something even more stupid he tried not to be offended may i escort you to your car are you crazy if we walk in there together everyone will guess what weve been doing especially with that dumb grin all over your face woody tried to stop grinning then why dont you go inside and ill wait out here for a minute good idea she walked away see you tomorrow he called after her she did not look back v ursula dewar had her own small suite of rooms in the old victorian mansion on delaware avenue there was a bedroom a bathroom and a dressing room and after her husband died she had converted his dressing room into a little parlour most of the time she had the whole house to herself gus and rosa spent a lot of time in washington and woody and chuck went to a boarding school but when they came home she spent a good deal of the day in her own quarters woody went to talk to her on sunday morning he was still walking on air after joannes kiss though he had spent half the night trying to figure out what it had meant it could signify anything from true love to true drunkenness all he knew was that he could hardly wait to see joanne again he walked into his grandmothers room behind the maid betty as she took in the breakfast tray he liked it that joanne got angry about the way bettys southern relations were treated in politics dispassionate argument was overrated he felt people should get angry about cruelty and injustice grandmama was already sitting up in bed wearing a lace shawl over a mushroomcoloured silk nightgown good morning woodrow she said surprised id like to have a cup of coffee with you grandmama if i may he had already asked betty to bring two cups this is an honour ursula said betty was a greyhaired woman of about fifty with the kind of figure that was sometimes called comfortable she set the tray in front of ursula and woody poured coffee into meissen cups he had given some thought to what he would say and had marshalled his arguments prohibition was over and lev peshkov was now a legitimate businessman he would contend furthermore it was not fair to punish daisy because her father had been a criminal especially since most of the respectable families in buffalo had bought his illegal booze do you know charlie farquharson he began yes of course she did she knew every family in the buffalo blue book she said would you like a piece of this toast no thank you ive had breakfast boys of your age never have enough to eat she looked at him shrewdly unless theyre in love she was on good form this morning woody said charlie is kind of under the thumb of his mother she kept her husband there too ursula said drily dying was the only way he could get free she drank some coffee and started to eat her grapefruit with a fork charlie came to me last night and asked me to ask you a favour she raised an eyebrow but said nothing woody took a breath he wants you to invite mrs peshkov to join the buffalo ladies society ursula dropped her fork and there was a chime of silver on fine porcelain as if covering her discomposure she said pour me some more coffee please woody he did her bidding saying nothing for the moment he could not recall ever seeing her discombobulated she sipped the coffee and said why in the name of heaven would charles farquharson or anyone else for that matter want olga peshkov in the society he wants to marry daisy does he and hes afraid his mother will object hes got that part right but he thinks he might be able to talk her around if i let olga into the society then people might forget that her father was a gangster a gangster well a bootlegger at least oh that ursula said dismissively thats not it really it was woodys turn to be surprised what is it then ursula looked thoughtful she was silent for such a long time that woody wondered if she had forgotten he was there then she said your father was in love with olga peshkov jesus dont be vulgar sorry grandmama you surprised me they were engaged to be married engaged he said astonished he thought for a minute then said i suppose im the only person in buffalo who doesnt know about this she smiled at him there is a special mixture of wisdom and innocence that comes only to adolescents i remember it so clearly in your father and i see it in you yes everyone in buffalo knows though your generation undoubtedly regard it as boring ancient history well what happened woody said i mean who broke it off she did when she got pregnant woodys mouth fell open by papa no by her chauffeur lev peshkov he was the chauffeur this was one shock after another woody was silent trying to take it in my goodness papa must have felt such a fool your papa was never a fool ursula said sharply the only foolish thing he did in his life was to propose to olga woody remembered his mission all the same grandmama it was an awful long time ago awfully you require an adverb not an adjective but your judgement is better than your grammar it is a long time that sounded hopeful so youll do it how do you think your father would feel woody considered he could not bullshit ursula she would see through it in a heartbeat would he care i guess he might be embarrassed if olga were around as a constant reminder of a humiliating episode in his youth you guess right on the other hand hes very committed to the ideal of behaving fairly to the people around him he hates injustice he wouldnt want to punish daisy for something her mother did even less to punish charlie papa has a pretty big heart bigger than mine you mean said ursula i didnt mean that grandmama but i bet if you asked him he wouldnt object to olga joining the society ursula nodded i agree but i wonder whether youve worked out who is the real originator of this request woody saw what she was driving at oh youre saying daisy put charlie up to it i wouldnt be surprised does it make any difference to the rights and wrongs of the situation i guess not so will you do it im glad to have a grandson with a kind heart even if i do suspect hes being used by a clever and ambitious girl woody smiled is that a yes grandmama you know i cant guarantee anything ill suggest it to the committee ursulas suggestions were regarded by everyone else as royal commands but woody did not say so thank you youre very kind now give me a kiss and get ready for church woody made his escape he quickly forgot about charlie and daisy sitting in the cathedral of st paul in shelton square he ignored the sermon about noah and the flood and thought about joanne rouzrokh her parents were in church but she was not would she really show up at the demonstration if she did he was going to ask her for a date but would she accept she was too smart to care about the age difference he reckoned she must know she had more in common with woody than with boneheads such as victor dixon and that kiss he was still tingling from it what she had done with her tongue did other girls do that he wanted to try it again as soon as he could thinking ahead if she did agree to date him what would happen in september she was going to vassar college in the town of poughkeepsie he knew that he would return to school and not see her until christmas vassar was for girls only but there must be men in poughkeepsie would she date other guys he was jealous already outside the church he told his parents he was not coming home for lunch but was going on the protest march good for you his mother said when young she had been the editor of the buffalo anarchist she turned to her husband you should go too gus the union has brought charges papa said you know i cant prejudge the result of a court case she turned back to woody just dont get beaten up by lev peshkovs goons woody got his camera out of the trunk of his fathers car it was a leica iii so small he could carry it on a strap around his neck yet it had shutter speeds as fast as one fivehundredth of a second he walked a few blocks to niagara square where the march was to begin lev peshkov had tried to persuade the city to ban the demonstration on the grounds that it would lead to violence but the union had insisted it would be peaceful the union seemed to have won that argument for several hundred people were milling around outside city hall many carried lovingly embroidered banners red flags and placards reading say no to boss thugs woody looked around for joanne but did not see her the weather was fine and the mood was sunny and he took a few shots workmen in their sunday suits and hats a car festooned with banners a young cop biting his nails there was still no sign of joanne and he began to think that she would not appear she might have a headache this morning he guessed the march was due to move off at noon it finally got going a few minutes before one there was a heavy police presence along the route woody noted he found himself near the middle of the procession as they walked south on washington street heading for the citys industrial heartland he saw joanne join the march a few yards ahead and his heart leaped she was wearing tailored pants that flattered her figure he hurried to catch up with her good afternoon he said happily good grief youre cheerful she said it was an understatement he was delirious with happiness are you hungover either that or ive contracted the black death which do you think it is if you have a rash its the black death are there any spots woody hardly knew what he was saying im not a doctor but id be happy to check you over stop being irrepressible i know its charming but im not in the mood woody tried to calm down we missed you in church he said the sermon was about noah to his consternation she burst out laughing oh woody she said i like you so much when youre funny but please dont make me laugh today he thought this remark was probably favourable but he was far from certain he spotted an open grocery store on a side street you need fluids he said ill be right back he ran into the store and bought two bottles of coke icecold from the refrigerator he got the clerk to open them then returned to the march when he handed a bottle to joanne she said oh boy youre a life saver she put the bottle to her lips and drank a long draught woody felt he was ahead so far the march was goodhumoured despite the grim incident they were protesting about a group of older men were singing political anthems and traditional songs there were even a few families with children and there was not a cloud in the sky have you read studies in hysteria woody asked as they walked along never heard of it oh its by sigmund freud i thought you were a fan of his im interested in his ideas ive never read one of his books you should studies in hysteria is amazing she looked curiously at him what made you read a book such as that i bet they dont teach psychology at your expensively oldfashioned school oh i dont know i guess i heard you talking about psychoanalysis and thought it sounded really extraordinary and it is in what way woody had the feeling she was testing him to see whether he had really understood the book or was merely pretending the idea that a crazy act such as obsessively spilling ink on a tablecloth can have a kind of hidden logic she nodded yeah she said thats it woody knew instinctively that she did not understand what he was talking about he had already overtaken her in his knowledge of freud but she was embarrassed to admit it whats your favourite thing to do he asked her theatre classical music i guess going to a film is no big treat for someone whose father owns about a hundred movie houses why do you ask well he decided to be honest i want to ask you out and id like to tempt you with something you really love to do so name it and well do it she smiled at him but it was not the smile he was hoping for it was friendly but sympathetic and it told him that bad news was coming woody id like to but youre fifteen as you said last night im more mature than victor dixon i wouldnt go out with him either woodys throat seemed to constrict and his voice came out hoarse are you turning me down yes very firmly i dont want to date a boy three years younger can i ask you again in three years well be the same age then she laughed then said stop being witty it hurts my head woody decided not to hide his pain what did he have to lose feeling anguished he said so what was that kiss about it was nothing he shook his head miserably it was something to me it was the best kiss ive ever had oh god i knew it was a mistake look it was just a bit of fun yes i enjoyed it be flattered youre entitled youre a cute kid and smart as a whip but a kiss is not a declaration of love woody no matter how much you enjoy it they were near the front of the march and woody saw their destination up ahead the high wall around the buffalo metal works the gate was closed and guarded by a dozen or more factory police thuggish men in lightblue shirts that mimicked police uniform and i was drunk joanne added yeah i was drunk too woody said it was a pathetic attempt to salvage his dignity but joanne had the grace to pretend to believe him then we both did something a little foolish and we should just forget it she said yeah said woody looking away they were outside the factory now those at the head of the march stopped at the gates and someone began to make a speech through a bullhorn looking more closely woody saw that the speaker was a local union organizer brian hall woodys father knew and liked the man at some time in the dim past they had worked together to resolve a strike the rear of the procession kept coming forward and a crush developed across the width of the street the factory police were keeping the entrance clear though the gates were shut woody now saw that they were armed with policetype nightsticks one of them was shouting stay away from the gate this is private property woody lifted his camera and took a picture but the people at the front were being pushed forward by those behind woody took joannes arm and tried to steer her away from the focus of tension however it was difficult the crowd was dense now and no one wanted to move out of the way against his will woody found himself edging closer to the factory gate and the guards with nightsticks this is not a good situation he said to joanne but she was flushed with excitement those bastards cant keep us back she cried a man next to her shouted right damn right the crowd was still ten yards or more from the gate but just the same the guards unnecessarily began to push demonstrators away woody took a photograph brian hall had been yelling into his bullhorn about boss thugs and pointing an accusing finger at the factory police now he changed his tune and began to call for calm move away from the gates please brothers he said move back no rough stuff woody saw a woman pushed by a guard hard enough to make her stumble she did not fall over but she cried out and the man with her said to the guard hey buddy take it easy will you are you trying to start something the guard said challengingly the woman yelled just stop shoving move back move back the guard shouted he raised his nightstick the woman screamed as the nightstick came down woody took a picture joanne said the son of a bitch hit that woman she stepped forward but most of the crowd began to move in the opposite direction away from the factory as they turned the guards came after them shoving kicking and lashing out with their truncheons brian hall said there is no need for violence factory police step back do not use your clubs then his bullhorn was knocked out of his hands by a guard some of the younger men fought back half a dozen real policemen moved into the crowd they did nothing to restrain the factory police but began to arrest anyone fighting back the guard who had started the fracas fell to the ground and two demonstrators started kicking him woody took a picture joanne was screaming with fury she threw herself at a guard and scratched his face he put out a hand to shove her away accidentally or otherwise the heel of his hand connected sharply with her nose she fell back with blood coming from her nostrils the guard raised his nightstick woody grabbed her by the waist and jerked her back the stick missed her come on woody yelled at her we have to get out of here the blow to her face had deflated her fury and she offered no resistance as he half pulled half carried her away from the gates as fast as he could his camera swinging on the strap around his neck the crowd was panicking now people falling over and others trampling them as everyone tried to flee woody was taller than most and he managed to keep himself and joanne upright they fought their way through the crush staying just ahead of the nightsticks at last the crowd thinned out joanne detached herself from his grasp and they both began to run the noise of the fight receded behind them they turned a couple of corners and a minute later found themselves on a deserted street of factories and warehouses all closed on sunday they slowed to a walk catching their breath joanne began to laugh that was so exciting she said woody could not share her enthusiasm it was nasty he said and it could have got worse he had rescued her and he half hoped that might cause her to change her mind about dating him but she did not feel she owed him much oh come on she said in a tone of disparagement nobody died those guards deliberately provoked a riot of course they did peshkov wants to make union members look bad well we know the truth woody tapped his camera and i can prove it they walked half a mile then woody saw a cruising cab and hailed it he gave the driver the address of the rouzrokh family home sitting in the back of the taxi he took a handkerchief from his pocket i dont want to bring you home to your father looking like this he said he unfolded the white cotton square and gently dabbed at the blood on her upper lip it was an intimate act and he found it sexy but she did not indulge him for long after a second she said ive got it she took the handkerchief from his grasp and cleaned herself up hows that youve missed a bit he lied he took the handkerchief back her mouth was wide she had even white teeth and her lips were enchantingly full he pretended there was something under her lower lip he wiped it gently then said better thanks she looked at him with an odd expression half fond half annoyed she knew he had been lying about the blood on her chin he guessed and she was not sure whether to be cross with him or not the cab halted outside her house dont come in she said im going to lie to my parents about where ive been and i dont want you blabbing the truth woody reckoned he was probably the more discreet of the two of them but he did not say so ill call you later okay she got out of the taxi and walked up the driveway with a perfunctory wave shes a doll said the driver too old for you though take me to delaware avenue woody said he gave the number and the cross street he was not going to talk about joanne to a goddamn cabby he pondered his rejection he should not have been surprised everyone from his brother to the taxi driver said he was too young for her all the same it hurt he felt as if he did not know what to do with his life now how would he get through the rest of the day back at home his parents were taking their ritual sunday afternoon nap chuck believed that was when they had sex chuck himself had gone swimming with a bunch of friends according to betty woody went into the darkroom and developed the film from his camera he ran warm water into the basin to bring the chemicals to the ideal temperature then put the film into a black bag to transfer it into a lighttrap tank it was a lengthy process that required patience but he was happy to sit in the dark and think about joanne their being together during a riot had not made her fall in love with him but it had certainly brought them closer he felt sure she was at least growing to like him more and more maybe her rejection was not final perhaps he should keep trying he certainly had no interest in any other girls when his timer rang he transferred the film into a stop bath to halt the chemical reaction then to a bath of fixer to make the image permanent finally he washed and dried his film and looked at the negative blackandwhite images on the reel he thought they were pretty good he cut the film into frames then put the first into the enlarger he laid a sheet of tenbyeight photographic paper on the base of the enlarger turned on the light and exposed the paper to the negative image while he counted seconds then he put the print into an open bath of developer this was the best part of the process slowly the white paper began to show patches of grey and the image he had photographed began to appear it always seemed to him like a miracle the first print showed a negro and a white man both in sunday suits and hats holding a banner that said brotherhood in large letters when the image was clear he moved the paper to a bath of fixer then washed it and dried it he printed all the shots he had taken took them out into the light and laid them out on the diningroom table he was pleased they were vivid active pictures that clearly showed a sequence of events when he heard his parents moving about upstairs he called his mother she had been a journalist before she married and she still wrote books and magazine articles what do you think he asked her she studied them thoughtfully with her one eye after a while she said i think theyre good you should take them to a newspaper really he said he began to feel excited which paper theyre all conservative unfortunately maybe the buffalo sentinel the editor is peter hoyle hes been there since god was a boy he knows your father well hell probably see you when should i show him the photos now the march is hot news it will be in all tomorrows papers they need the pictures tonight woody was energized all right he said he picked up the glossy sheets and shuffled them into a neat stack his mother produced a cardboard folder from papas study woody kissed her and left the house he caught a bus downtown the front entrance of the sentinel office was closed and he suffered a moment of dismay but he reasoned that reporters must be able to get in and out today if they were to produce a monday morning paper and sure enough he found a side entrance i have some photographs for mr hoyle he said to a man sitting inside the door and he was directed upstairs he found the editors office a secretary took his name and a minute later he was shaking hands with peter hoyle the editor was a tall imposing man with white hair and a black moustache he appeared to be finishing a meeting with a younger colleague he spoke loudly as if shouting over the noise of a printing press the hitandrun drivers story is fine but the intro stinks jack he said with a dismissive hand on the mans shoulder moving him to the door put a new nose on it move the mayors statement to later and start with crippled children jack left and hoyle turned to woody what have you got kid he said without preamble i was at the march today you mean the riot it wasnt a riot until the factory guards started hitting women with their clubs i hear the marchers tried to break into the factory and the guards repelled them its not true sir and the photos prove it show me woody had arranged them in order while sitting on the bus he put the first down on the editors desk it started peacefully hoyle pushed the photograph aside thats nothing he said woody brought out a picture taken at the factory the guards were waiting at the gate you can see their nightsticks his next picture had been taken when the shoving started the marchers were at least ten yards from the gate so there was no need for the guards to try to move them back it was a deliberate provocation okay said hoyle and he did not push the pictures aside woody brought out his best shot a guard using a truncheon to beat a woman i saw this whole incident woody said all the woman did was tell him to stop shoving her and he hit her like this good picture said hoyle any more one said woody most of the marchers ran away as soon as the fighting began but a few fought back he showed hoyle the photograph of two demonstrators kicking a guard on the ground these men retaliated against the guard who hit the woman you did a good job young dewar said hoyle he sat at his desk and pulled a form from a tray twenty bucks okay you mean youre going to print my photographs i assume thats why you brought them here yes sir thank you twenty dollars is okay i mean fine i mean plenty hoyle scribbled on the form and signed it take this to the cashier my secretary will tell you where to go the phone on the desk rang the editor picked it up and barked hoyle woody gathered he was dismissed and left the room he was elated the payment was amazing but he was more thrilled that the newspaper would use his photos he followed the secretarys directions to a little room with a counter and a tellers window and got his twenty bucks then he went home in a taxi his parents were delighted by his coup and even his brother seemed pleased over dinner grandmama said as long as you dont consider journalism as a career that would be lowering in fact woody had been thinking that he might take up news photography instead of politics and he was surprised to learn that his grandmother disapproved his mother smiled and said but ursula dear i was a journalist thats different youre a girl grandmama replied woodrow must become a man of distinction like his father and grandfather before him mother did not take offence at this she was fond of grandmama and listened with amused tolerance to her pronouncements of orthodoxy however chuck resented the traditional focus on the elder son he said and what must i become chopped liver dont be vulgar charles said grandmama having the last word as usual that night woody lay awake a long time he could hardly wait to see his photos in the paper he felt the way he had as a kid on christmas eve his longing for the morning kept him from sleep he thought about joanne she was wrong to think him too young he was right for her she liked him they had a lot in common and she had enjoyed the kiss he still thought he might win her heart he fell asleep at last and when he woke it was daylight he put on a dressing gown over his pyjamas and ran downstairs joe the butler always went out early to buy the newspapers and they were already laid out on the side table in the breakfast room woodys parents were there his father eating scrambled eggs his mother sipping coffee woody picked up the sentinel his work was on the front page but it was not what he expected they had used only one of his shots the last it showed a factory guard lying on the ground being kicked by two workers the headline was metal strikers riot oh no he said he read the report with incredulity it said that marchers had attempted to break into the factory and had been bravely repelled by the factory police several of whom had suffered minor injuries the behaviour of the workers was condemned by the mayor the chief of police and lev peshkov at the foot of the article like an afterthought union spokesman brian hall was quoted as denying the story and blaming the guards for the violence woody put the newspaper in front of his mother i told hoyle that the guards started the riot and i gave him the pictures to prove it he said angrily why would he print the opposite of the truth because hes a conservative she said newspapers are supposed to tell the truth woody said his voice rising with furious indignation they cant just make up lies yes they can she said but its not fair welcome to the real world said his mother vi greg peshkov and his father were in the lobby of the ritzcarlton hotel in washington dc when they ran into dave rouzrokh dave was wearing a white suit and a straw hat he glared at them with hatred lev greeted him but he turned away contemptuously without answering greg knew why dave had been losing money all summer because roseroque theatres was not able to get firstrun hit movies and dave must have guessed that lev was somehow responsible last week lev had offered dave four million dollars for his movie houses half the original bid and dave had again refused the price is dropping dave lev had warned now greg said i wonder what hes doing here hes meeting with sol starr hes going to ask why sol wont give him good movies lev obviously knew all about it what will mr starr do string him along greg marvelled at his fathers ability to know everything and stay on top of a changing situation he was always ahead of the game they rode up in the elevator this was the first time greg had visited his fathers permanent suite at the hotel his mother marga had never been here lev spent a lot of time in washington because the government was forever interfering with the movie business men who considered themselves to be moral leaders got very agitated about what was shown on the big screen and they put pressure on the government to censor pictures lev saw this as a negotiation he saw life as a negotiation and his constant aim was to avoid formal censorship by adhering to a voluntary code a strategy backed by sol starr and most other hollywood big shots they entered a living room that was extremely fancy much more so than the spacious apartment in buffalo where greg and his mother lived and which greg had always thought to be luxurious this room had spindly legged furniture that greg imagined to be french rich chestnutbrown velvet drapes at the windows and a large phonograph in the middle of the room he was stunned to see sitting on a yellow silk sofa the movie star gladys angelus people said she was the most beautiful woman in the world greg could see why she radiated sex appeal from her darkblue inviting eyes to the long legs crossed under her clinging skirt as she put out a hand to shake his her red lips smiled and her round breasts moved alluringly inside a soft sweater he hesitated a split second before shaking her hand he felt disloyal to his mother marga she never mentioned the name of gladys angelus a sure sign that she knew what people were saying about gladys and lev greg felt he was making friends with his mothers enemy if mom knew about this she would cry he thought but he had been taken by surprise if he had been forewarned if he had had time to think about his reaction he might have prepared and rehearsed a gracious withdrawal but he could not bring himself to be clumsily rude to this overwhelmingly lovely woman so he took her hand looked into her amazing eyes and gave what people called a shiteating grin she kept hold of his hand as she said im so happy to meet you at long last your father has told me all about you but he didnt say how handsome you are there was something unpleasantly proprietorial about this as if she were a member of the family rather than a whore who had usurped his mother all the same he found himself falling under her spell i love your films he said awkwardly oh stop it you dont have to say that she said but greg thought she liked to hear it all the same come and sit by me she went on i want to get to know you he did as he was told he could not help himself gladys asked him what school he attended and while he was telling her the phone rang he vaguely heard his father say into the phone it was supposed to be tomorrow okay if we have to we can rush it leave it with me ill handle it lev hung up and interrupted gladys your room is down the hall greg he said he handed over a key and youll find a gift from me settle in and enjoy yourself well meet for dinner at seven this was abrupt and gladys looked put out but lev could be peremptory sometimes and it was best just to obey greg took the key and left in the corridor was a broadshouldered man in a cheap suit he reminded greg of joe brekhunov head of security at the buffalo metal works greg nodded and the man said good afternoon sir presumably he was a hotel employee greg entered his room it was pleasant enough though not as swanky as his fathers suite he did not see the gift his father had mentioned but his suitcase was there and he began to unpack thinking about gladys was he being disloyal to his mother by shaking hands with his fathers mistress of course gladys was only doing what marga herself had done sleeping with a married man all the same he felt painfully uncomfortable was he going to tell his mother that he had met gladys hell no as he was hanging up his shirts he heard a knock it came from a door that looked as if it might lead to the neighbouring room next moment the door opened and a girl walked through she was older than greg but not much her skin was the colour of dark chocolate and she wore a polkadot dress and carried a clutch bag she smiled broadly showing white teeth and said hello ive got the room next door i figured that out he said who are you jacky jakes she held out her hand im an actress greg shook hands with the second beautiful actress in an hour jacky had a playful look that greg found more attractive than gladyss overpowering magnetism her mouth was a darkpink bow he said my dad said he had got me a gift are you it she giggled i guess i am he said i would like you hes going to get me into the movies greg got the picture his father had guessed that he might feel bad about being friendly with gladys jacky was his reward for not making a fuss he thought he probably ought to reject such a bribe but he could not resist youre a very nice gift he said your fathers real good to you hes wonderful greg said and so are you arent you sweet she put her purse down on the dresser stepped closer to greg stood on tiptoe and kissed his mouth her lips were soft and warm i like you she said she felt his shoulders youre strong i play ice hockey makes a girl feel safe she put both hands on his cheeks and kissed him again longer then she sighed and said oh boy i think were going to have fun are we washington was a southern city still largely segregated in buffalo white and black people could eat in the same restaurants and drink in the same bars mostly but here it was different greg was not sure what the laws were but he felt certain that in practice a white man with a black woman would cause trouble it was surprising to find jacky occupying a room in this hotel lev must have fixed it but certainly there was no question of greg and jacky swanning around town with lev and gladys in a foursome so what did jacky think they were going to do to have fun together the amazing notion crossed his mind that she might be willing to go to bed with him he put his hands on her waist to draw her to him for another kiss but she pulled back i need to take a shower she said give me a few minutes she turned and disappeared through the communicating door closing it behind her he sat on the bed trying to take it all in jacky wanted to act in movies and it seemed she was willing to use sex to advance her career she certainly was not the first actress black or white to use that strategy gladys was doing the same by sleeping with lev greg and his father were the lucky beneficiaries he saw that she had left her clutch bag behind he picked it up and tried the door it was not locked he stepped through she was on the phone wearing a pink bathrobe she said yes hunkydory no problem her voice seemed different more mature and he realized that with him she had been using a sexylittlegirl tone that was not natural then she saw him smiled and reverted to the girly voice as she said into the phone please hold my calls i dont want to be disturbed thank you goodbye you left this said greg and handed her the purse you just wanted to see me in my bathrobe she said coquettishly the front of the robe did not entirely hide her breasts and he could see an enchanting curve of flawless brown skin he grinned no but im glad i did go back to your room i have to shower i might let you see more later oh my god he said he returned to his room this was astonishing i might let you see more later he repeated to himself aloud what a thing for a girl to say he had a hardon but he did not want to jerk off when the real thing seemed so close to take his mind off it he went on unpacking he had an expensive shaving kit razor and brush with pearl handles a present from his mother he laid the things out in the bathroom wondering whether they would impress jacky if she saw them the walls were thin and he heard the sound of running water from the next room the thought of her body naked and wet possessed him he tried to concentrate on arranging his underwear and socks in a drawer then he heard her scream he froze for a moment he was too surprised to move what did it mean why would she yell out like that then she screamed again and he was shocked into action he threw open the communicating door and stepped into her room she was naked he had never seen a naked woman in real life she had pointed breasts with darkbrown tips at her groin was a thatch of wiry black hair she was cowering back against the wall trying ineffectually to cover her nakedness with her hands standing in front of her was dave rouzrokh with twin scratches down his aristocratic cheek presumably caused by jackys pinkvarnished nails there was blood on the broad lapel of daves doublebreasted white jacket jacky screamed get him away from me greg swung a fist dave was an inch taller but he was an old man and greg was an athletic teenager the blow connected with daves chin more by luck than by judgement and dave staggered back then fell to the floor the room door opened the broadshouldered hotel employee greg had seen earlier came in he must have a master key greg thought im tom cranmer house detective the man said whats going on here greg said i heard her scream and came in to find him here jacky said he tried to rape me dave struggled to his feet thats not true he said i was asked to come to this room for a meeting with sol starr jacky began to sob oh now hes going to lie about it cranmer said put something on please miss jacky put on her pink bathrobe the detective picked up the room phone dialled a number and said theres usually a cop on the corner get him into the lobby right now dave was staring at greg youre peshkovs bastard arent you greg was about to hit him again dave said oh my god this is a setup greg was thrown by this remark he felt intuitively that dave was telling the truth he dropped his fist this whole scene must have been scripted by lev he realized dave rouzrokh was no rapist jacky was faking and greg himself was just an actor in the movie he felt dazed please come with me sir said cranmer taking dave firmly by the arm you two as well you cant arrest me said dave yes sir i can said cranmer and im going to hand you over to a police officer greg said to jacky do you want to get dressed she shook her head quickly and decisively greg realized it was part of the plan that she would appear in her robe he took jackys arm and they followed cranmer and dave along the corridor and into the elevator a cop was waiting in the lobby both he and the hotel detective must be in on the plot greg surmised cranmer said i heard a scream from her room found the old guy in there she says he tried to rape her the kid is a witness dave looked bewildered as if he thought this might be a bad dream greg found himself feeling sorry for dave he had been cruelly trapped lev was more pitiless than greg had imagined half of him admired his father the other half wondered if such ruthlessness was really necessary the cop snapped handcuffs on dave and said all right lets go go where dave said downtown said the cop greg said do we all have to go yeah cranmer spoke to greg in a low voice dont worry son he said you did a great job well go to the precinct house and make our statements and after that you can fuck her from here to christmastime the cop led dave to the door and the others followed as they stepped outside a photographer popped a flashgun vii woody dewar got a copy of freuds studies in hysteria mailed to him by a bookseller in new york on the night of the yacht club ball the climactic social event of the summer season in buffalo he wrapped it neatly in brown paper and tied a red ribbon around it chocolates for a lucky girl said his mother passing him in the hall she had only one eye but she saw everything a book he said for joanne rouzrokh she wont be at the ball i know mama stopped and gave him a searching look after a moment she said youre serious about her i guess but she thinks im too young her pride is probably involved her friends would ask why she cant find a guy her own age to go out with girls are cruel like that im planning to persist until she grows more mature mama smiled i bet you make her laugh i do its the best card i hold well heck i waited long enough for your father did you i loved him from the first time i met him i pined for years i had to watch him fall for that shallow cow olga vyalov who wasnt worthy of him but had two working eyes thank god she got knocked up by her chauffeur mamas language could be a little coarse especially when grandmama was not around she had picked up bad habits during the years she spent working on newspapers then he went off to war i had to follow him to france before i could nail his foot to the goddamn floor nostalgia was mixed with pain in her reminiscence woody could tell but he realized you were the right girl for him in the end yes maybe thatll happen to me mama kissed him good luck my son she said the rouzrokh house was less than a mile away and woody walked there none of the rouzrokhs would be at the yacht club tonight dave had been all over the papers after a mysterious incident at the ritzcarlton hotel in washington a typical headline had read cinema mogul accused by starlet woody had recently learned to mistrust newspapers however gullible people said there must be something in it otherwise why would the police have arrested dave none of the family had been seen at any social event since outside the house an armed guard stopped woody the family arent seeing callers he said brusquely woody guessed the man had spent a lot of time repelling reporters and he forgave the discourteous tone he recalled the name of the rouzrokhs maid please ask miss estella to tell joanne that woody dewar has a book for her you can leave it with me said the guard holding out his hand woody held on firmly to the book thanks but no the guard looked annoyed but he walked woody up the drive and rang the doorbell estella opened it and said at once hello mr woody come in joanne will be so glad to see you woody permitted himself a triumphant glance at the guard as he stepped inside estella showed him into an empty drawing room she offered him milk and cookies as if he were still a kid and he declined politely joanne came in a minute later her face was drawn and her olive skin looked washedout but she smiled pleasantly at him and sat down to chat she was pleased with the book now ill have to read dr freud instead of just gabbing about him she said youre a good influence on me woody i wish i could be a bad influence she let that pass arent you going to the ball i have a ticket but if youre not there im not interested would you like to go to a movie instead no thanks really or we could just get dinner somewhere really quiet if you dont mind taking the bus oh woody of course i dont mind the bus but youre too young for me anyway the summers almost over youll be back at school soon and im going to vassar where youll go on dates i guess i sure hope so woody stood up okay well im going to take a vow of celibacy and enter a monastery please dont come and visit me youll distract the other brethren she laughed thank you for taking my mind off my familys troubles it was the first time she had mentioned what had happened to her father he had not been planning to raise the subject but now that she had he said you know were all on your side nobody believes that actresss story everyone in town realizes it was a setup by that swine lev peshkov and were furious about it i know she said but the accusation alone is too shameful for my father to bear i think my parents are going to move to florida im so sorry thank you now go to the ball maybe i will she walked him to the door may i kiss you goodbye he said she leaned forward and kissed his lips this was not like the last kiss and he knew instinctively not to grab her and press his mouth to hers it was a gentle kiss her lips on his for a sweet moment that was over in a breath then she pulled away and opened the front door goodnight woody said as he stepped out goodbye said joanne viii greg peshkov was in love he knew that jacky jakes had been bought for him by his father as his reward for helping to entrap dave rouzrokh but despite that it was real love he had lost his virginity a few minutes after they had returned from the precinct house and the two of them had then spent most of a week in bed at the ritzcarlton greg did not need to use birth control she told him because she was already fixed up he had only the vaguest idea what that meant but he took her at her word he had never been so happy in his life and he adored her especially when she dropped the littlegirl act and revealed a shrewd intelligence and a mordant sense of humour she admitted that she had seduced greg on his fathers orders but confessed that against her will she had fallen in love her real name was mabel jakes and although she pretended to be nineteen she was in fact just sixteen only a few months older than greg lev had promised her a part in a movie but he said he was still looking for just the right role in a perfect imitation of levs vestigial russian accent she said but i dont guess hes lookin too fuckin hard i guess there arent many parts written for negro actors greg said i know ill end up playing the maid rolling my eyes and saying lawdy there are africans in plays and films cleopatra hannibal othello but theyre usually played by white actors her father now dead had been a professor in a negro college and she knew more about literature than greg did anyway why should negroes only play black people if cleopatra can be played by a white actress why cant juliet be black people would find it strange people would get used to it they get used to anything does jesus have to be played by a jew nobody cares she was right greg thought but all the same it was never going to happen when lev had announced their return to buffalo leaving it until the last minute as usual greg had been devastated he had asked his father if jacky could come to buffalo but lev had laughed and said son you dont shit where you eat you can see her next time you come to washington despite that jacky had followed him to buffalo a day later and moved into a cheap apartment near canal street lev and greg had been busy for the next couple of weeks with the takeover of roseroque theatres dave had sold for two million in the end a quarter of the original offer and gregs admiration for his father went up another notch jacky had withdrawn her charges and hinted to the newspapers that she had accepted a cash settlement greg was awestruck by his fathers callous nerve and he had jacky he told his mother he was out every night with male friends but in fact he spent all his spare time with jacky he showed her around town picnicked with her at the beach even managed to take her out in a borrowed speedboat no one connected her with the rather blurred newspaper photograph of a girl walking out of the ritzcarlton hotel in a bathrobe but mostly they spent the warm summer evenings having sweaty deliriously happy sex tangling the worn sheets on the narrow bed in her small apartment they decided to get married as soon as they were old enough tonight he was taking her to the yacht club ball it had been extraordinarily difficult to get tickets but greg had bribed a school friend he had bought jacky a new dress pink satin he got a generous allowance from marga and lev loved to slip him fifty bucks now and again so he always had more money than he needed in the back of his mind a warning was sounding jacky would be the only negro at the ball not serving drinks she was very reluctant to go but greg had talked her round the young men would envy him but the older ones might be hostile he knew there would be some muttering jackys beauty and charm would overcome much prejudice he felt how could anyone resist her but if some fool got drunk and insulted her greg would teach him a lesson with both fists even as he thought this he heard his mother telling him not to be a lovestruck fool but a man could not go through life listening to his mother as he walked along canal street in white tie and tails he looked forward to seeing her in the new dress and maybe kneeling to lift the hem up until he could see her panties and garter belt he entered her building an old house now subdivided there was a threadbare red carpet on the stairs and a smell of spicy cooking he let himself into the apartment with his own key the place was empty that was odd where would she go without him with fear in his heart he opened the closet the pink satin ball dress hung there on its own her other clothes were gone no he said aloud how could this happen on the rickety pine table was an envelope he picked it up and saw his name on the front in jackys neat schoolgirl handwriting a feeling of dread came over him he tore open the envelope with shaky hands and read the short message my darling greg the last three weeks have been the happiest time of my entire life i knew in my heart that we couldnt ever get married but it was nice to pretend you are a lovely boy and will grow into a fine man if you dont take after your father too much had lev found out that jacky was living here and somehow made her leave he would not do that would he goodbye and dont forget me your gift jacky greg crumpled the paper and wept ix you look wonderful eva rothmann said to daisy peshkov if i was a boy id fall in love with you in a minute daisy smiled eva was already a little bit in love with her and daisy did look wonderful in an iceblue silk organdie ball gown that deepened the blue of her eyes the skirt of the dress had a frilled hem that was ankle length in front but rose playfully to midcalf behind giving a tantalizing glimpse of daisys legs in sheer stockings she wore a sapphire necklace of her mothers your father bought me that back in the days when he was still occasionally nice to me olga said but hurry up daisy youre making us all late olga was wearing matronly navy blue and eva was in red which suited her dark colouring daisy walked down the stairs on a cloud of happiness they stepped out of the house henry the gardener doubling as chauffeur tonight opened the doors of the shiny old black stutz this was daisys big night tonight charlie farquharson would formally propose to her he would offer her a diamond ring that was a family heirloom she had seen and approved it and it had been altered to fit her she would accept his proposal and then they would announce their engagement to everyone at the ball she got into the car feeling like cinderella only eva had expressed doubts i thought youd go for someone who was more of a match for you she had said you mean a man who wont let me boss him around daisy had replied no but someone more like you goodlooking and charming and sexy this was unusually sharp for eva it implied that charlie was homely and charmless and unglamorous daisy had been taken aback and did not know how to reply her mother had saved her olga had said i married a man who was goodlooking and charming and sexy and he made me utterly miserable eva had said no more as the car approached the yacht club daisy vowed to restrain herself she must not show how triumphant she felt she must act as if there was nothing unexpected about her mother being asked to join the buffalo ladies society as she showed the other girls her enormous diamond she would be so gracious as to declare that she did not deserve someone as wonderful as charlie she had plans to make him even more wonderful as soon as the honeymoon was over she and charlie would start building their stable of racehorses in five years they would be entering the most prestigious races around the world saratoga springs longchamps royal ascot summer was turning to fall and it was dusk when the car drew up at the pier im afraid we may be very late tonight henry daisy said gaily quite all right miss daisy he replied he adored her you have a wonderful time now at the door daisy noticed victor dixon following them in feeling well disposed towards everyone she said so victor your sister met the king of england congratulations mm yes he said looking embarrassed they entered the club the first person they saw was ursula dewar who had agreed to accept olga into her snobby club daisy smiled warmly at her and said good evening mrs dewar ursula seemed distracted excuse me just a moment she said and moved away across the lobby she thought herself a queen daisy reflected but did that mean she had no need of good manners one day daisy would rule over buffalo society but she would be unfailingly gracious to all she vowed the three women went into the ladies room where they checked their appearance in the mirrors in case anything had gone wrong in the twenty minutes since they had left home dot renshaw came in looked at them and went out again stupid girl daisy said but her mother looked worried whats happening she said weve been here five minutes and already three people have snubbed us jealousy daisy said dot would like to marry charlie herself olga said at this point dot renshaw would like to marry more or less anybody i guess come on lets enjoy ourselves said daisy and she led the way out as she entered the ballroom woody dewar greeted her at last a gentleman daisy said in a lowered voice he said i just want to say that i think its wrong of people to blame you for anything your father might have done especially when they all bought their booze from him she replied then she saw her future motherinlaw in a ruched pink gown that did nothing for her angular figure nora farquharson was not ecstatic about her sons choice of bride but she had accepted daisy and had been charming to olga when they had exchanged visits mrs farquharson daisy said what a lovely dress nora farquharson turned her back and walked away eva gasped a feeling of horror came over daisy she turned back to woody this isnt about bootlegging is it no what then you must ask charlie here he comes charlie was perspiring though it was not warm whats going on daisy asked him everyones giving me the cold shoulder he was terribly nervous people are so angry at your family he said what for she cried several people nearby heard her raised voice and looked around she did not care charlie said your father ruined dave rouzrokh are you talking about that incident in the ritzcarlton what has that got to do with me everyone likes dave even though hes persian or something and they dont believe he would rape anybody i never said he did i know charlie said he was clearly in agony people were frankly staring now victor dixon dot renshaw chuck dewar daisy said to charlie but im going to be blamed is that so your father did a terrible thing daisy was cold with fear surely she could not lose her triumph at the last minute charlie she said what are you telling me talk straight for the love of god eva put her arm around daisys waist in a gesture of support charlie replied mother says its unforgivable what does that mean unforgivable he stared miserably at her he could not bring himself to speak but there was no need she knew what he was going to say its over isnt it she said youre jilting me he nodded olga said daisy we must leave she was in tears daisy looked around she tilted her chin as she stared them all down dot renshaw looking maliciously pleased victor dixon admiring chuck dewar with his mouth open in adolescent shock and his brother woody looking sympathetic to hell with you all daisy said loudly im going to london to dance with the king it was a sunny saturday afternoon in may and lloyd williams was at the end of his second year at cambridge when fascism reared its vile head among the white stone cloisters of the ancient university lloyd was at emmanuel college known as emma doing modern languages he was studying french and german but he preferred german as he immersed himself in the glories of german culture reading goethe schiller heine and thomas mann he looked up occasionally from his desk in the quiet library to watch with sadness as todays germany descended into barbarism then the local branch of the british union of fascists announced that their leader sir oswald mosley would address a meeting in cambridge the news took lloyd back to berlin three years earlier he saw again the brownshirt thugs wrecking maud von ulrichs magazine office heard again the grating sound of hitlers hatefilled voice as he stood in the parliament and poured scorn on democracy shuddered anew at the memory of the dogs bloody muzzles savaging jörg with a bucket over his head now lloyd stood on the platform at cambridge railway station waiting to meet his mother off the train from london with him was ruby carter a fellow activist in the local labour party she had helped him organize todays meeting on the subject of the truth about fascism lloyds mother eth leckwith was to speak her book about germany had been a big success she had stood for parliament again in the election and she was once again the member for aldgate lloyd was tense about the meeting mosleys new political party had gained many thousands of members due in part to the enthusiastic support of the daily mail which had run the infamous headline hurrah for the blackshirts mosley was a charismatic speaker and would undoubtedly recruit new members today it was vital that there should be a bright beacon of reason to contrast with his seductive lies however ruby was chatty she was complaining about the social life of cambridge im so bored with local boys she said all they want to do is go to a pub and get drunk lloyd was surprised he had imagined that ruby had a welldeveloped social life she wore inexpensive clothes that were always a bit tight showing off her plump curves most men would find her attractive he thought what do you like to do he asked apart from organize labour party meetings i love dancing you cant be short of partners there are twelve men for every woman at the university no offence intended but most of the university men are pansies there were a lot of homosexual men at cambridge university lloyd knew but it startled him to hear her mention the subject ruby was famously blunt but this was shocking even from her he had no idea how to respond so he said nothing ruby said youre not one of them are you no dont be ridiculous no need to be insulted youre handsome enough for a pansy except for that squashed nose he laughed thats what they call a backhanded compliment you are though you look like douglas fairbanks junior well thanks but im not a pansy have you got a girlfriend this was becoming embarrassing no not at the moment he made a show of checking his watch and looking for the train why not i just havent met miss right oh thank you very much im sure he looked at her she was only half joking he felt mortified that she had taken his remark personally i didnt mean yes you did but never mind heres the train the locomotive drew into the station and came to a halt in a cloud of steam the doors opened and passengers stepped out on to the platform students in tweed jackets farmers wives going shopping working men in flat caps lloyd scanned the crowd for his mother shell be in a thirdclass carriage he said matter of principle ruby said would you come to my twentyfirst birthday party of course my friends got a little flat in market street and a deaf landlady lloyd was not comfortable about this invitation and hesitated over his reply then his mother appeared as pretty as a songbird in a red summer coat and a jaunty little hat she hugged and kissed him you look very well my lovely she said but i must buy you a new suit for next term this one is fine mam he had a scholarship that paid his university fees and basic living expenses but it did not run to suits when he had started at cambridge his mother had dipped into her savings and bought him a tweed suit for daytime and an evening suit for formal dinners he had worn the tweed every day for two years and it showed he was particular about his appearance and made sure that he always had a clean white shirt a perfectly knotted tie and a folded white handkerchief in his breast pocket there had to be a dandy somewhere in his ancestry the suit was carefully pressed but it was beginning to look shabby and in truth he longed for a new one but he did not want his mother to spend her savings well see she said she turned to ruby smiled warmly and held out her hand im eth leckwith she said with the easy grace of a visiting duchess pleased to meet you im ruby carter are you a student too ruby no im a maid at chimbleigh a big country house ruby looked a bit ashamed as she made this confession its five miles out of town but i can usually borrow a bike fancy that said ethel when i was your age i was a maid at a country house in wales ruby was amazed you a housemaid and now youre a member of parliament thats what democracy means lloyd said ruby and i organized todays meeting together his mother said and how is it going sold out in fact we had to move to a bigger hall i told you it would work the meeting had been ethels idea ruby carter and many others in the labour party had wanted to mount a protest demonstration marching through the town lloyd had agreed at first fascism must be publicly opposed at every opportunity he had said ethel had counselled otherwise if we march and shout slogans we look just like them she had said show that were different hold a quiet intelligent meeting to discuss the reality of fascism lloyd had been dubious ill come and speak if you like she had said lloyd had put that to the cambridge party there had been a lively discussion with ruby leading the opposition to ethels plan but in the end the prospect of having an mp and famous feminist to speak had clinched it lloyd was still not sure that it had been the right decision he recalled maud von ulrich in berlin saying we must not meet violence with violence that had been the policy of the german social democratic party for the von ulrich family and for germany the policy had been a catastrophe they walked out through the yellowbrick romanesque arches of the station and hurried along leafy station road a street of smug middleclass houses made of the same yellow brick ethel put her arm through lloyds hows my little undergraduate then she said he smiled at the word little he was four inches taller than her and muscular because of his training with the university boxing team he could have picked her up with one hand she was bursting with pride he knew few things in life had pleased her as much as his coming to this place that was probably why she wanted to buy him suits i love it here you know that he said ill love it more when its full of workingclass boys and girls ruby put in they turned into hills road the main thoroughfare leading to the town centre since the coming of the railway the town had expanded south towards the station and churches had been built along hills road to serve the new suburb their destination was a baptist chapel whose leftwing pastor had agreed to loan it free of charge i made a bargain with the fascists lloyd said i said wed refrain from marching if they would promise to do the same im surprised they agreed said ethel fascists love marching they were reluctant but i told the university authorities and the police what i was proposing and the fascists pretty much had to go along with it that was clever but mam guess who is their local leader viscount aberowen otherwise known as boy fitzherbert the son of your former employer earl fitzherbert boy was twentyone the same age as lloyd he was at trinity the aristocratic college what my god she seemed more shaken than he had expected and he glanced at her she had gone pale are you shocked yes she seemed to recover her composure his father is a junior minister in the foreign office the government was a conservativedominated coalition fitz must be embarrassed most conservatives are soft on fascism i imagine they see little wrong with killing communists and persecuting jews some of them perhaps but you exaggerate she gave lloyd a sideways look so you went to see boy yes lloyd thought this seemed to have special significance for ethel but he could not imagine why i thought him perfectly frightful in his room at trinity he had a whole case of scotch twelve bottles you met him once before do you remember no when was that you were nine years old i took you to the palace of westminster shortly after i was elected we met fitz and boy on the stairs lloyd did vaguely remember then as now the incident seemed to be mysteriously important to his mother that was him how funny ruby put in i know him hes a pig he paws maids lloyd was shocked but his mother seemed unsurprised very unpleasant but it happens all the time her grim acceptance made it more horrifying to him they reached the chapel and went in through the back door there in a kind of vestry was robert von ulrich looking startlingly british in a bold greenandbrown check suit and a striped tie he stood up and ethel hugged him in faultless english robert said my dear ethel what a perfectly charming hat lloyd introduced his mother to the local labour party women who were preparing urns of tea and plates of biscuits to be served after the meeting having heard ethel complain many times that people who organized political events seemed to think that an mp never needed to go to the toilet he said ruby before we start would you show my mother where the ladies facilities are the two women went off lloyd sat down next to robert and said conversationally hows business robert was now the proprietor of a restaurant much favoured by the homosexuals about whom ruby had been complaining somehow he had known that cambridge in the s was congenial to such men just as berlin had been in the s his new place had the same name as the old bistro robert business is good he answered a shadow crossed his face a brief but intense look of real fear this time i hope i can keep what ive built up were doing our best to fight off the fascists and meetings such as this are the way to do it lloyd said your talk will be a big help it will open peoples eyes robert was going to speak about his personal experience of life under fascism a lot of them say it couldnt happen here but theyre wrong robert nodded grim agreement fascism is a lie but an alluring one lloyds visit to berlin three years ago was vivid in his mind i often wonder what happened to the old bistro robert he said i had a letter from a friend robert said in a voice full of sadness none of the old crowd go there any more the macke brothers auctioned off the wine cellar now the clientele is mostly middleranking cops and bureaucrats he looked even more pained as he added they no longer use tablecloths he changed the subject abruptly do you want to go to the trinity ball most of the colleges held summer dances to celebrate the end of exams the balls plus associated parties and picnics constituted may week which illogically took place in june the trinity ball was famously lavish id love to go but i cant afford it lloyd said tickets are two guineas arent they ive been given one but you can have it several hundred drunk students dancing to a jazz band is actually my idea of hell lloyd was tempted but i havent got a tailcoat college balls required whitetieandtails borrow mine itll be too big at the waist but were the same height then i will thank you ruby reappeared your mother is wonderful she said to lloyd i never knew she used to be a maid robert said i have known ethel for more than twenty years she is truly extraordinary i can see why you havent met miss right ruby said to lloyd youre looking for someone like her and there arent many youre right about the last part anyway lloyd said theres no one like her ruby winced as if in pain lloyd said whats wrong toothache you must go to the dentist she looked at him as if he had said something stupid and he realized that on a housemaids wage she could not afford to pay a dentist he felt foolish he went to the door and peeped through to the main hall like many nonconformist churches this was a plain rectangular room with walls painted white it was a warm day and the clearglass windows were open the rows of chairs were full and the audience was waiting expectantly when ethel reappeared lloyd said if its all right with everyone ill open the meeting then robert will tell his personal story and my mother will draw out the political lessons they all agreed ruby will you keep an eye on the fascists let me know if anything happens ethel frowned is that really necessary we probably shouldnt trust them to keep their promise ruby said theyre meeting a quarter of a mile up the road i dont mind running in and out she left by the back door and lloyd led the others into the church there was no stage but a table and three chairs stood at the near end with a lectern to one side as ethel and robert took their seats lloyd went to the lectern there was a brief round of subdued applause fascism is on the march lloyd began and it is dangerously attractive it gives false hope to the unemployed it wears a spurious patriotism as the fascists themselves wear imitation military uniforms the british government was keen to appease fascist regimes to lloyds dismay it was a coalition dominated by conservatives with a few liberals and a sprinkling of renegade labour ministers who had split with their party only a few days after it was reelected last november the foreign secretary had proposed to yield much of abyssinia to the conquering italians and their fascist leader benito mussolini worse still germany was rearming and aggressive just a couple of months ago hitler had violated the versailles treaty by sending troops into the demilitarized rhineland and lloyd had been horrified to see that no country had been willing to stop him any hope he had that fascism might be a temporary aberration had now vanished lloyd believed that democratic countries such as france and britain must get ready to fight but he did not say so in his speech today for his mother and most of the labour party opposed a buildup in british armaments and hoped that the league of nations would be able to deal with the dictators they wanted at all costs to avoid repeating the dreadful slaughter of the great war lloyd sympathized with that hope but feared it was not realistic he was preparing himself for war he had been an officer cadet at school and when he came up to cambridge he had joined the officer training corps the only workingclass boy and certainly the only labour party member to do so he sat down to muted applause he was a clear and logical speaker but he did not have his mothers ability to touch hearts not yet anyway robert stepped to the lectern i am austrian he said in the war i was wounded captured by the russians and sent to a prison camp in siberia after the bolsheviks made peace with the central powers the guards opened the gates and told us we were free to go getting home was our problem not theirs it is a long way from siberia to austria more than three thousand miles there was no bus so i walked surprised laughter rippled around the room with a few appreciative handclaps robert had already charmed them lloyd saw ruby came up to him looking annoyed and spoke in his ear the fascists just went by boy fitzherbert was driving mosley to the railway station and a bunch of hotheads in black shirts were running after the car cheering lloyd frowned they promised they wouldnt march i suppose theyll say that running behind a car doesnt count whats the difference id like to know any violence no keep a lookout ruby retired lloyd was bothered the fascists had certainly broken the spirit of the agreement if not the letter they had appeared on the street in their uniforms and there had been no counterdemonstration the socialists were here inside the church invisible all there was to show for their stand was a banner outside the church saying the truth about fascism in large red letters robert was saying i am pleased to be here honoured to have been invited to address you and delighted to see several patrons of bistro robert in the audience however i must warn you that the story i have to tell is most unpleasant and indeed gruesome he related how he and jörg had been arrested after refusing to sell the berlin restaurant to a nazi he described jörg as his chef and longtime business partner saying nothing of their sexual relationship though the more knowing people in the church probably guessed the audience became very quiet as he began to describe events in the concentration camp lloyd heard gasps of horror when he got to the part where the starving dogs appeared robert described the torture of jörg in a low clear voice that carried across the room by the time he came to jörgs death several people were weeping lloyd himself relived the cruelty and anguish of those moments and he was possessed by rage against such fools as boy fitzherbert whose infatuation with marching songs and smart uniforms threatened to bring the same torment to england robert sat down and ethel went to the lectern as she began to speak ruby reappeared looking furious i told you this wouldnt work she hissed in lloyds ear mosley has gone but the boys are singing rule britannia outside the station that certainly was a breach of the agreement lloyd thought angrily boy had broken his promise so much for the word of an english gentleman ethel was explaining how fascism offered false solutions simplistically blaming groups such as jews and communists for complex problems such as unemployment and crime she made merciless fun of the concept of the triumph of the will likening the führer and the duce to playground bullies they claimed popular support but banned all opposition lloyd realized that when the fascists returned from the railway station to the centre of town they would have to pass this church he began to listen to the sounds coming through the open windows he could hear cars and lorries growling along hills road punctuated now and again by the trill of a bicycle bell or the cry of a child he thought he heard a distant shout and it sounded ominously like the noise made by rowdy boys young enough still to be proud of their new deep voices he tensed straining to hear and there were more shouts the fascists were marching ethel raised her own voice as the bellowing outside got louder she argued that working people of all kinds needed to band together in trade unions and the labour party to build a fairer society step by democratic step not through the kind of violent upheaval that had gone so badly wrong in communist russia and nazi germany ruby reentered theyre marching up hills road now she said in a low urgent murmur we have to go out there and confront them no lloyd whispered the party made a collective decision no demonstration we must stick to that we must be a disciplined movement he knew the reference to party discipline would carry weight with her the fascists were nearby now raucously chanting lloyd guessed there must be fifty or sixty of them he itched to go out there and face them two young men near the back stood up and went to the windows to look out ethel urged caution dont react to hooliganism by becoming a hooligan she said that will only give the newspapers an excuse to say that one side is as bad as the other there was a crash of breaking glass and a stone came through the window a woman screamed and several people got to their feet please remain seated ethel said i expect they will go away in a minute she talked on in a calm and reassuring voice few people attended to her speech everyone was looking backwards towards the church door and listening to the hoots and jeers of the ruffians outside lloyd had to struggle to sit still he looked towards his mother with a neutral expression fixed like a mask on his face every bone in his body wanted to rush outside and punch heads after a minute the audience quietened somewhat they returned their attention to ethel though still fidgeting and looking back over their shoulders ruby muttered were like a pack of rabbits shaking in our burrow while the fox barks outside her tone was contemptuous and lloyd felt she was right but his mothers forecast proved true and no more stones were thrown the chanting receded why do the fascists want violence ethel asked rhetorically those out there in hills road might be mere hooligans but someone is directing them and their tactics have a purpose when there is fighting in the streets they can claim that public order has broken down and drastic measures are needed to restore the rule of law those emergency measures will include banning democratic political parties such as labour prohibiting trade union action and jailing people without trial people such as us peaceful men and women whose only crime is to disagree with the government does this sound fantastic to you unlikely something that could never happen well they used exactly those tactics in germany and it worked she went on to talk about how fascism should be opposed in discussion groups at meetings such as this one by writing letters to the newspapers by using every opportunity to alert others to the danger but even ethel had trouble making this sound courageous and decisive lloyd was cut to the quick by rubys talk of rabbits he felt like a coward he was so frustrated that he could hardly sit still slowly the atmosphere in the hall returned to normal lloyd turned to ruby the rabbits are safe anyhow he said for now she said but the fox will be back ii if you like a boy you can let him kiss you on the mouth said lindy westhampton sitting on the lawn in the sunshine and if you really like him he can feel your breasts said her twin sister lizzie but nothing below the waist not until youre engaged daisy was intrigued she had expected english girls to be inhibited but she had been wrong the westhampton twins were sex mad daisy was thrilled to be a guest at chimbleigh the country house of sir bartholomew bing westhampton it made her feel that she had been accepted into english society but she still had not met the king she recalled her humiliation at the buffalo yacht club with a sense of shame that was still like a burn on her skin continuing to give her agonizing pain long after the flame had gone away but whenever she felt that pain she thought about how she was going to dance with the king and she imagined them all dot renshaw nora farquharson ursula dewar poring over her picture in the buffalo sentinel reading every word of the report envying her and wishing that they could honestly say they had always been her friends things had been difficult at first daisy had arrived three months ago with her mother and her friend eva her father had given them a handful of introductions to people who turned out not to be the crème de la crème of londons social scene daisy had begun to regret her overconfident exit from the yacht club ball what if it all came to nothing but daisy was determined and resourceful and she needed no more than a foot in the door even at entertainments that were more or less public such as horse races and operas she met highranking people she flirted with the men and she piqued the curiosity of the matrons by letting them know she was rich and single many aristocratic english families had been ruined by the depression and an american heiress would have been welcome even if she were not pretty and charming they liked her accent they tolerated her holding her fork in her right hand and they were amused that she could drive a car in england men did the driving many english girls could ride a horse as well as daisy but few looked so pertly assured in the saddle some older women still viewed daisy with suspicion but she would win them around eventually she felt sure bing westhampton had been easy to flirt with an elfin man with a winning smile he had an eye for a pretty girl and daisy knew instinctively that more than his eye would be involved if he got the chance of a twilight fumble in the garden clearly his daughters took after him the westhamptons house party was one of several in cambridgeshire held to coincide with may week the guests included earl fitzherbert known as fitz and his wife bea she was countess fitzherbert of course but she preferred her russian title of princess their elder son boy was at trinity college princess bea was one of the social matriarchs who were doubtful about daisy without actually telling a lie daisy had let people assume that her father was a russian nobleman who had lost everything in the revolution rather than a factory worker who had fled to america one step ahead of the police but bea was not taken in i cant recall a family called peshkov in st petersburg or moscow she had said hardly pretending to be puzzled and daisy had forced herself to smile as if it was of no consequence what the princess could remember there were three girls the same age as daisy and eva the westhampton twins plus may murray the daughter of a general the balls went on all night so everyone slept until midday but the afternoons were dull the five girls lazed in the garden or strolled in the woods now sitting up in her hammock daisy said what can you do after youre engaged lindy said you can rub his thing until it squirts said her sister may murray who was not as daring as the twins said oh disgusting that only encouraged the twins or you can suck it said lindy they like that best of all stop it may protested youre just making this up they stopped having teased may enough im bored said lindy what shall we do an imp of mischief seized daisy and she said lets come down to dinner in mens clothes she regretted it immediately a stunt like that could ruin her social career when it had only just got started evas german sense of propriety was upset daisy you dont mean it no she said silly notion the twins had their mothers fine blonde hair not their fathers dark curls but they had inherited his streak of naughtiness and they both loved the idea theyll all be in tailcoats tonight so we can steal their dinner jackets said lindy yes said her twin well do it while theyre having tea daisy saw that it was too late to back out may murray said we couldnt go to the ball like that the whole party was to attend the trinity ball after dinner well change again before leaving said lizzie may was a timid creature probably cowed by her military father and she always went along with whatever the other girls decided eva as the only dissident was overruled and the plan went ahead when the time came to dress for dinner a maid brought two evening suits into the bedroom daisy was sharing with eva the maids name was ruby yesterday she had been miserable with toothache so daisy had given her the money for a dentist and she had had the tooth pulled out now ruby was brighteyed with excitement toothache forgotten here you are ladies she said sir bartholomews should be small enough for you miss peshkov and mr andrew fitzherberts for miss rothmann daisy took off her dress and put on the shirt ruby helped her with the unfamiliar studs and cufflinks then she climbed into bing westhamptons trousers black with a satin stripe she tucked her slip in and pulled the suspenders over her shoulders she felt a bit daring as she buttoned the fly none of the girls knew how to knot a tie so the results were distinctly limp but daisy came up with the winning touch using an eyebrow pencil she gave herself a moustache its marvellous said eva you look even prettier daisy drew sidewhiskers on evas cheeks the five girls met up in the twins bedroom daisy walked in with a mannish swagger that made the others giggle hysterically may voiced the concern that remained in the back of daisys mind i hope were not going to get into trouble over this lindy said oh who cares if we do daisy decided to forget her misgivings and enjoy herself and she led the way down to the drawing room they were the first to arrive and the room was empty repeating something she had heard boy fitzherbert say to the butler daisy put on a mans voice and drawled pour me a whisky grimshaw theres a good chap this champagne tastes like piss the others squealed with shocked laughter bing and fitz came in together bing in his white waistcoat made daisy think of a pied wagtail a cheeky blackandwhite bird fitz was a goodlooking middleaged man his dark hair touched with grey as a result of war wounds he walked with a slight limp and one eyelid drooped but this evidence of his courage in battle only made him more dashing fitz saw the girls looked twice and said good god his tone was sternly disapproving daisy suffered a moment of sheer panic had she spoiled everything the english could be frightfully straightlaced everyone knew that would she be asked to leave the house how terrible that would be dot renshaw and nora farquharson would crow if she went home in disgrace she would rather die but bing burst out laughing i say thats terribly good he said look at this grimshaw the elderly butler coming in with a bottle of champagne in a silver ice bucket observed them bleakly in a tone of withering insincerity he said most amusing sir bartholomew bing continued to regard them all with a delight mingled with lasciviousness and daisy realized too late that dressing like the opposite sex might misleadingly suggest to some men a degree of sexual freedom and a willingness to experiment a suggestion that could obviously lead to trouble as the party assembled for dinner most of the other guests followed the lead of their host in treating the girls prank as an amusing piece of tomfoolery though daisy could tell that they were not all equally charmed daisys mother went pale with fright when she saw them and sat down quickly as if she felt shaky princess bea a heavily corseted woman in her forties who might once have been pretty wrinkled her powdered brow in a censorious frown but lady westhampton was a jolly woman who reacted to life as to her wayward husband with a tolerant smile she laughed heartily and congratulated daisy on her moustache the boys coming last were also delighted general murrays son lieutenant jimmy murray not as straightlaced as his father roared with pleased laughter the fitzherbert sons boy and andy came in together and it was boys reaction that was the most interesting of all he stared at the girls with mesmeric fascination he tried to cover up with jollity hawhawing like the other men but it was clear he was weirdly captivated at dinner the twins picked up daisys joke and talked like men in deep voices and hearty tones making the others laugh lindy held up her wine glass and said how do you like this claret liz lizzie replied i think its a bit thin old boy ive a notion bings been watering it dont you know all through dinner daisy kept catching boy staring at her he did not resemble his handsome father but all the same he was goodlooking with his mothers blue eyes she began to feel embarrassed as if he were ogling her breasts to break the spell she said and have you been taking exams boy good lord no he said his father said too busy flying his plane to study much this was phrased as a criticism but it sounded as if fitz was actually proud of his elder son boy pretended to be outraged a slander he said eva was mystified why are you at the university if you dont wish to study lindy explained some of the boys dont bother to graduate especially if theyre not academic types lizzie added especially if theyre rich and lazy i do study boy protested but i dont intend actually to sit the exams its not as if im hoping to make a living as a doctor or something boy would inherit one of the largest fortunes in england when fitz died and his lucky wife would be countess fitzherbert daisy said wait a minute do you really have your own airplane yes i do a hornet moth i belong to the university aero club we use a little airfield outside the town but thats wonderful you must take me up daisys mother said oh dear no boy said to daisy wouldnt you be nervous not a bit then i will take you he turned to olga its perfectly safe mrs peshkov i promise ill bring her back in one piece daisy was thrilled the conversation moved on to this summers favourite topic englands stylish new king edward viii and his romance with wallis simpson an american woman separated from her second husband the london newspapers said nothing about it except to include mrs simpson on lists of guests at royal events but daisys mother got the american papers sent over and they were full of speculation that wallis would divorce mr simpson and marry the king completely out of the question said fitz severely the king is the head of the church of england he cannot possibly marry a divorcée when the ladies retired leaving the men to port and cigars the girls hurried to change daisy decided to emphasize how very feminine she really was and chose a ball dress of pink silk patterned with tiny flowers that had a matching jacket with puffed short sleeves eva wore a dramatically simple black silk gown with no sleeves in the past year she had lost weight changed her hair and learned under daisys tuition to dress in an unfussy tailored style that flattered her eva had become like one of the family and olga delighted in buying clothes for her daisy regarded her as the sister she had never had it was still light when they all climbed into cars and carriages and drove the five miles into the town centre daisy thought cambridge was the quaintest place she had ever seen with its winding little streets and elegant college buildings they got out at trinity and daisy gazed up at the statue of its founder king henry viii when they passed through the sixteenthcentury brick gatehouse daisy gasped with pleasure at the sight that met her eyes a large quadrangle its trimmed green lawn crossed by cobbled paths with an elaborate architectural fountain in the middle on all four sides timeworn buildings of golden stone formed the backdrop against which young men in tailcoats danced with gorgeously dressed girls and dozens of waiters in evening dress offered trays crowded with glasses of champagne daisy clapped her hands with joy this was just the kind of thing she loved she danced with boy then jimmy murray then bing who held her close and let his right hand drift from the small of her back down to the swell of her hips she decided not to protest the english band played a watery imitation of american jazz but they were loud and fast and they knew all the latest hits night fell and the quadrangle was illuminated with blazing torches daisy took a break to check on eva who was not so selfconfident and sometimes needed to be introduced around however she need not have worried she found eva talking to a strikingly handsome student in a suit too big for him eva introduced him as lloyd williams weve been talking about fascism in germany lloyd said as if daisy might want to join in the discussion how extraordinarily dull of you daisy said lloyd seemed not to hear that i was in berlin three years ago when hitler came to power i didnt meet eva then but it turns out we have some acquaintances in common jimmy murray appeared and asked eva to dance lloyd was visibly disappointed to see her go but summoned his manners and graciously asked daisy and they moved closer to the band what an interesting person your friend eva is he said why mr williams thats what every girl longs to hear from her dancing partner daisy replied as soon as the words were out of her mouth she regretted sounding shrewish but he was amused he grinned and said dear me youre so right i am justly reproved i must try to be more gallant she immediately liked him better for being able to laugh at himself it showed confidence he said are you staying at chimbleigh like eva yes then you must be the american who gave ruby carter the money for the dentist how on earth do you know about that shes a friend of mine daisy was surprised do many undergraduates befriend housemaids my goodness what a snobbish thing to say my mother was a housemaid before she became a member of parliament daisy felt herself blush she hated snobbery and often accused others of it especially in buffalo she thought she was totally innocent of such unworthy attitudes ive got off on the wrong foot with you havent i she said as the dance came to an end not really he said you think its dull to talk about fascism yet you take a german refugee into your home and even invite her to travel to england with you you think housemaids have no right to be friends with undergraduates yet you pay for ruby to see the dentist i dont suppose ill meet another girl half as intriguing as you tonight ill take that as a compliment here comes your fascist friend boy fitzherbert do you want me to scare him off daisy sensed that lloyd would relish the chance of a quarrel with boy certainly not she said and turned to smile at boy boy nodded curtly to lloyd evening williams good evening said lloyd i was disappointed that your fascists marched along hills road last saturday ah yes boy said they got a bit overenthusiastic it surprised me when you had given your word that they would not daisy saw that lloyd was angry about this underneath his mask of cool courtesy boy refused to take it seriously sorry about that he said lightly he turned to daisy come and see the library he said to her its by christopher wren with pleasure daisy said she waved goodbye to lloyd and let boy take her arm lloyd looked disappointed to see her go which pleased her on the west side of the quadrangle a passage led to a courtyard with a single elegant building at the far end daisy admired the cloisters on the ground floor boy explained that the books were on the upper floor because the river cam was liable to flood lets go and look at the river he said its pretty at night daisy was twenty years old and though she was inexperienced she knew that boy did not really care for gazing on rivers at night but she wondered after his reaction to seeing her in mens clothing whether he might really prefer boys to girls she guessed she was about to find out do you actually know the king she asked as he led her across a second courtyard yes hes more my fathers friend obviously but he comes to our house sometimes and hes jolly keen on some of my political ideas i can tell you id love to meet him she was sounding naive she knew but this was her chance and she was not going to miss it they passed through a gateway and emerged on to a smooth lawn sloping down to a narrow walledin river this area is called the backs boy said most of the older colleges own the fields on the other side of the water he put his arm around her waist as they approached a little bridge his hand moved up as if accidentally until his forefinger lay along the underside of her breast at the far end of the little bridge two college servants in uniform stood guard presumably to repel gatecrashers one of the men murmured good evening viscount aberowen and the other smothered a grin boy responded with a barely perceptible nod daisy wondered how many other girls he had led across this bridge she knew boy had a motive for giving her this tour and sure enough he stopped in the darkness and put his hands on her shoulders i say you looked jolly fetching in that outfit at dinner his voice was throaty with excitement im glad you thought so she knew the kiss was coming and she felt aroused at the prospect but she was not quite ready she put a hand on his shirt front palm flat holding him at a distance i really want to be presented at the royal court she said is it difficult to arrange not difficult at all he said not for my family at least and not for someone as pretty as you he dipped his head eagerly towards hers she leaned away would you do that for me will you fix it for me to be presented of course she moved in closer and felt the erection bulging at the front of his trousers no she thought he doesnt prefer boys promise she said i promise he said breathlessly thank you she said then she let him kiss her iii the little house in wellington row aberowen south wales was crowded at one oclock on saturday afternoon lloyds grandfather sat at the kitchen table looking proud on one side he had his son billy williams a coal miner who had become member of parliament for aberowen on the other was his grandson lloyd the cambridge university student absent was his daughter also a member of parliament it was the williams dynasty no one here would ever say that the notion of a dynasty was undemocratic and these people believed in democracy the way the pope believed in god but just the same lloyd suspected granda was thinking it also at the table was uncle billys lifelong friend and agent tom griffiths lloyd was honoured to sit with such men granda was a veteran of the miners union uncle billy had been courtmartialled in for revealing britains secret war against the bolsheviks tom had fought alongside billy at the battle of the somme this was more impressive than dining with royalty lloyds grandmother cara williams had served them stewed beef with homemade bread and now they sat drinking tea and smoking friends and neighbours had come in as they always did when billy was here and half a dozen of them stood leaning against the walls smoking pipes and handrolled cigarettes filling the little kitchen with the smell of men and tobacco billy had the short stature and broad shoulders of many miners but unlike the others he was well dressed in a navyblue suit with a clean white shirt and a red tie lloyd noticed that they all used his first name often as if to emphasize that he was one of them empowered by their votes they called lloyd boyo making it clear that they were not overimpressed by a university student but they addressed granda as mr williams he was the one they truly respected through the open back door lloyd could see the slag heap from the mine an evergrowing mountain which had now reached the lane behind the house lloyd was spending the summer vacation as a lowpaid organizer at a camp for unemployed colliers their project was to refurbish the miners institute library lloyd found the physical work of sanding and painting and building shelves a refreshing change from reading schiller in german and molière in french he enjoyed the banter among the men he had inherited from his mother a love of the welsh sense of humour it was great but it was not fighting fascism he winced every time he remembered how he had skulked in the baptist chapel while boy fitzherbert and the other bullies chanted in the street and threw stones through the window he wished he had gone outside and punched someone it might have been stupid but he would have felt better he thought about it every night before falling asleep he also thought about daisy peshkov in a pink silk jacket with puffed sleeves he had seen daisy a second time in may week he had gone to a recital in the chapel of kings college because the student in the room next to his at emmanuel was playing the cello and daisy had been in the audience with the westhamptons she had been wearing a straw hat with a turnedup brim that made her look like a naughty schoolgirl he had sought her out afterwards and asked her questions about america where he had never been he wanted to know about president roosevelts administration and whether it had any lessons to teach britain but all daisy talked about was tennis parties and polo matches and yacht clubs despite that he had been captivated by her all over again he liked her gay chatter all the more because it was punctuated now and again by unexpected darts of sarcastic wit he had said i dont want to keep you from your friends i just wanted to ask about the new deal and she had replied oh boy you really know how to flatter a girl but then as they parted she had said call me when you come to london mayfair two four three four today he had come to his grandparents house for the midday meal on his way to the railway station he had a few days off from the work camp and he was taking the train to london for a short break he was vaguely hoping he might run into daisy as if london were a little town like aberowen at the camp he was in charge of political education and he told his grandfather he had organized a series of lectures by leftwing dons from cambridge i tell them its their chance to get out of the ivory tower and meet the working class and they find it hard to refuse me grandas paleblue eyes looked down his long sharp nose i hope our lads teach them a thing or two about the real world lloyd pointed to tom griffithss son standing in the open back door and listening at sixteen lenny already had the characteristic griffiths shadow of a black beard that never went away even when his cheeks were freshly shaved lenny had an argument with a marxist lecturer good for you len said granda marxism was popular in south wales which was sometimes jokingly called little moscow but granda had always been fiercely anticommunist lloyd said tell granda what you said lenny lenny grinned and said in the anarchist leader mikhail bakunin warned karl marx that communists in power would be as oppressive as the aristocracy they replaced after what has happened in russia can you honestly say bakunin was wrong granda clapped his hands a good debating point had always been relished around his kitchen table lloyds grandmother poured him a fresh cup of tea cara williams was grey lined and bent like all the women of her age in aberowen she asked lloyd are you courting yet my lovely the men grinned and winked lloyd blushed too busy studying grandmam but an image of daisy peshkov came into his mind together with the phone number mayfair two four three four his grandmother said whos this ruby carter then the men laughed and uncle billy said caught out boyo lloyds mother had obviously been talking ruby is membership officer of my local labour party in cambridge thats all lloyd protested billy said sarcastically oh aye very convincing and the men laughed again you wouldnt want me to go out with ruby grandmam lloyd said youd think she wears her clothes too tight she doesnt sound very suitable cara said youre a university man now you must set your sights higher she was just as snobbish as daisy lloyd perceived theres nothing wrong with ruby carter he said but im not in love with her you must marry an educated woman a schoolteacher or a trained nurse the trouble was that she was right lloyd liked ruby but he would never love her she was pretty enough and intelligent too and lloyd was as vulnerable as the next man to a curvy figure but still he knew she was not right for him worse grandmam had put her wrinkled old finger precisely on the reason rubys outlook was restricted her horizons narrow she was not exciting not like daisy thats enough womens chatter granda said billy tell us the news from spain its bad said billy all europe was watching spain the leftwing government elected last february had suffered an attempted military coup backed by fascists and conservatives the rebel general franco had won support from the catholic church the news had struck the rest of the continent like an earthquake after germany and italy would spain too fall under the curse of fascism the revolt was botched as you probably know and it almost failed billy went on but hitler and mussolini came to the rescue and saved the insurrection by airlifting thousands of rebel troops from north africa as reinforcements lenny put in and the unions saved the government thats true billy said the government was slow to react but the trade unions led the way in organizing workers and arming them with weapons they had seized from military arsenals ships gun shops and anywhere else they could find them granda said at least someone is fighting back until now the fascists have had it all their own way in the rhineland and abyssinia they just walked in and took what they wanted thank god for the spanish people i say theyve got the guts to say no there was a murmur of agreement from the men around the walls lloyd again recalled that saturday afternoon in cambridge he too had let the fascists have it all their own way he seethed with frustration but can they win said granda weapons seem to be the issue now isnt it aye said billy the germans and the italians are supplying the rebels with guns and ammunition as well as fighter planes and pilots but no one is helping the elected spanish government and why the bloody hell not said lenny angrily cara looked up from the cooking range her dark mediterranean eyes flashed disapproval and lloyd thought he glimpsed the beautiful girl she had once been none of that language in my kitchen she said sorry mrs williams i can tell you the inside story billy said and the men went quiet listening the french prime minister leon blum a socialist as you know was all set to help hes already got one fascist neighbour germany and the last thing he wants is a fascist regime on his southern border too sending arms to the spanish government would enrage the french right wing and french catholic socialists too but blum could withstand that especially if he had british support and could say that arming the government was an international initiative granda said so what went wrong our government talked him out of it blum came to london and our foreign secretary anthony eden told him we would not support him granda was angered why does he need support how can a socialist prime minister let himself be bullied by the conservative government of another country because theres a danger of a military coup in france too said billy the press there is rabidly right wing and theyre whipping their own fascists into a frenzy blum can fight them off with british support but perhaps not without so its our conservative government being soft on fascism again all those tories have investments in spain wine textiles coal steel and theyre afraid the leftwing government will expropriate them what about america they believe in democracy surely theyll sell guns to spain youd think so wouldnt you but theres a wellfinanced catholic lobby led by a millionaire called joseph kennedy opposing any help to the spanish government and a democratic president needs catholic support roosevelt wont do anything to jeopardize his new deal well theres something we can do said lenny griffiths and a look of adolescent defiance came over his face whats that len boy said billy we can go to spain and fight his father said dont talk daft lenny lots of people are talking about going all over the world even in america they want to form volunteer units to fight alongside the regular army lloyd sat upright do they this was the first he had heard of it how do you know i read about it in the daily herald lloyd was electrified volunteers going to spain to fight the fascists tom griffiths said to lenny well youre not going and thats that billy said remember those boys who lied about their age to fight in the great war thousands of them and totally useless most of them tom said i recall that kid who cried before the somme what was his name billy owen bevin he ran away didnt he aye to a firing squad the bastards shot him for desertion fifteen he was poor little tyke lenny said im sixteen aye said his father big difference that granda said lloyd here is going to miss the train to london in about ten minutes lloyd had been so struck by lennys revelation that he had not kept an eye on the clock he jumped up kissed his grandmother and picked up his small suitcase lenny said ill walk with you to the station lloyd said his goodbyes and hurried down the hill lenny said nothing seeming preoccupied lloyd was glad not to have to talk his mind was in turmoil the train was in lloyd bought a thirdclass ticket to london as he was about to board lenny said tell me now lloyd how do you get a passport youre serious about going to spain arent you come on man dont muck about i want to know the whistle blew lloyd climbed aboard closed the door and let down the window you go to the post office and ask for a form he said lenny said despondently if i went to the aberowen post office and asked for a passport form my mother would hear of it about thirty seconds later then go to cardiff said lloyd and the train pulled away he settled in his seat and took from his pocket a copy of le rouge et le noir by stendhal in french he stared at the page without taking anything in he could think of only one idea going to spain he knew he should be scared but all he felt was excitement at the prospect of fighting really fighting not just holding meetings against the kind of men who had set the dogs on jörg no doubt fear would come later before a boxing match he was not scared in the dressing room but when he entered the ring and saw the man who wanted to beat him unconscious looked at the muscular shoulders and the hard fists and the vicious face then his mouth went dry and his heart pounded and he had to suppress the impulse to turn and run away right now he was mainly worried about his parents bernie was so proud of having a stepson at cambridge he had told half the east end and he would be devastated if lloyd left before getting his degree ethel would be frightened that her son might be wounded or killed they would both be terribly upset there were other issues how would he get to spain what city would he go to how would he pay the fare but only one snag really gave him pause daisy peshkov he told himself not to be ridiculous he had met her twice she was not even very interested in him that was smart of her because they were illsuited she was a millionaires daughter and a shallow socialite who thought talking about politics was dull she liked men such as boy fitzherbert that alone proved she was wrong for lloyd yet he could not get her out of his mind and the thought of going to spain and losing all chance of seeing her again filled him with sadness mayfair two four three four he felt ashamed of his hesitation especially when he recalled lennys simple determination lloyd had been talking about fighting fascism for years now there was a chance to do it how could he not go he reached londons paddington station took the tube to aldgate and walked to the row house in nutley street where he had been born he let himself in with his own key the place had not changed much since he was a child but one innovation was the telephone on a little table next to the hat stand it was the only phone in the street and the neighbours treated it as public property beside the phone was a box in which they placed the money for their calls his mother was in the kitchen she had her hat on ready to go out to address a labour party meeting what else but she put the kettle on and made him tea how are they all in aberowen she asked uncle billy is there this weekend he said all the neighbours came into grandas kitchen its like a medieval court are your grandparents well granda is the same as ever grandmam looks older he paused lenny griffiths wants to go to spain to fight the fascists she pursed her lips in disapproval does he now im considering going with him what do you think he was expecting opposition but even so her reaction surprised him dont you bloody dare she said savagely she did not share her mothers aversion to swear words dont even speak of it she slammed the teapot down on the kitchen table i bore you in pain and suffering and raised you and put shoes on your feet and sent you to school and i didnt go through all that for you to throw your life away in a bloody war he was taken aback i wasnt thinking of throwing my life away he said but i might risk it in a cause you brought me up to believe in to his astonishment she began to sob she rarely cried in fact lloyd could not remember the last time mother dont he put his arm around her shaking shoulders it hasnt happened yet bernie came into the kitchen a stocky middleaged man with a bald dome whats all this he said he looked a bit scared lloyd said im sorry dad ive upset her he stepped back and let bernie put his arms around ethel she wailed hes going to spain hell be killed lets all calm down and discuss it sensibly bernie said he was a sensible man wearing a sensible dark suit and muchrepaired shoes with sensible thick soles no doubt that was why people voted for him he was a local politician representing aldgate on the london county council lloyd had never known his own father but he could not imagine loving a real father more than he loved bernie who had been a gentle stepfather quick to comfort and advise slow to command or punish he treated lloyd no differently from his daughter millie bernie persuaded ethel to sit at the kitchen table and lloyd poured her a cup of tea i thought my brother was dead once ethel said her tears still flowing the telegrams came to wellington row and the wretched boy from the post office had to go from one house to the next giving men and women the bits of paper that said their sons and husbands were dead poor lad what was his name geraint i think but he didnt have a telegram for our house and wicked woman that i am i thanked god it was others that had died and not our billy youre not a wicked woman bernie said patting her lloyds halfsister millie appeared from upstairs she was sixteen but looked older especially dressed as she was this evening in a stylish black outfit and small gold earrings for two years she had worked in a womens wear shop in aldgate but she was bright and ambitious and in the last few days she had got a job in a swanky west end department store she looked at ethel and said mam whats the matter she spoke with a cockney accent your brother wants to go to spain and get himself killed ethel cried millie looked accusingly at lloyd what have you been saying to her millie was always quick to find fault with her older brother whom she felt was undeservedly adored lloyd responded with fond tolerance lenny griffiths from aberowen is going to fight the fascists and i told mam i was thinking about going with him trust you millie said disgustedly i doubt if you can get there said bernie ever practical after all the country is in the middle of a civil war i can get a train to marseilles barcelonas not far from the french border eighty or ninety miles and its a cold walk over the pyrenees there must be ships going from marseilles to barcelona its not so far by sea true stop it bernie ethel cried you sound as if youre discussing the quickest way to piccadilly circus hes talking about going to war i wont allow it hes twentyone you know bernie said we cant stop him i know how bloody old he is bernie looked at his watch we need to get to the meeting youre the main speaker and lloyds not going to spain tonight how do you know she said we might get home and find a note saying hes caught the boat train to paris i tell you what said bernie lloyd promise your mother you wont go for a month at least its not a bad idea anyway you need to check the lie of the land before you rush off set her mind at ease just temporarily then we can talk about it again it was a typical bernie compromise calculated to let everyone back off without backing down but lloyd was reluctant to make a commitment on the other hand he probably could not simply jump on a train he had to find out what arrangements the spanish government might be making to receive volunteers ideally he would go in company with lenny and others he would need visas foreign currency a pair of boots all right he said i wont go for a month promise his mother said i promise ethel became calm after a minute she powdered her face and looked more normal she drank her tea then she put her coat on and she and bernie left right im off too said millie where are you going lloyd asked her the gaiety it was a music hall in the east end do they let sixteenyearolds in she gave him an arch look whos sixteen not me anyway daves going and hes only fifteen she was speaking of their cousin david williams son of uncle billy and aunt mildred well enjoy yourselves she went to the door and came back just dont get killed in spain you stupid sod she put her arms around him and hugged him hard then went out without saying any more when he heard the front door slam he went to the phone he did not have to think to recall the number he could see daisy in his minds eye turning as she left him smiling winningly under the straw hat saying mayfair two four three four he picked up the phone and dialled what was he going to say you told me to phone so here i am that was feeble the truth i dont admire you at all but i cant get you off my mind he should invite her to something but what a labour party meeting a man answered this is mrs peshkovs residence good evening the deferential tone made lloyd think he was a butler no doubt daisys mother had rented a london house complete with staff this is lloyd williams he wanted to say something that would explain or justify his call and he added the first thing that came to mind of emmanuel college it meant nothing but he hoped it sounded impressive may i speak to miss daisy peshkov no im sorry professor williams said the butler assuming lloyd must be a don theyve all gone to the opera of course lloyd thought with disappointment no socialite was home at this time of the evening especially on a saturday i remember he lied she told me she was going and i forgot covent garden isnt it he held his breath but the butler was not suspicious yes sir the magic flute i believe thank you lloyd hung up he went to his room and changed in the west end most people wore evening dress even to go to the cinema but what would he do when he got there he could not afford a ticket to the opera and anyway it would be over soon he took the tube the royal opera house was incongruously located next to covent garden londons wholesale fruit and vegetable market the two institutions got along well because they kept different hours the market opened for business at three or four oclock in the morning when londons most determined revellers were beginning to head for home and it closed before the matinee lloyd walked past the shuttered stalls of the market and looked through glazed doors into the opera house its bright lobby was empty and he could hear muffled mozart he stepped inside adopting a careless upperclass manner he said to an attendant what time does the curtain come down if he had been wearing his tweed suit he would probably have been told that it was none of his business but the dinner jacket was the uniform of authority and the attendant said in about five minutes sir lloyd nodded curtly to say thank you would have given him away he left the building and walked around the block it was a moment of quiet in the restaurants people were ordering coffee in the cinemas the big feature was approaching its melodramatic climax everything would change soon and the streets would be thronged with people shouting for taxis heading to nightclubs kissing goodbye at bus stops and hurrying for the last train back to the suburbs he returned to the opera house and went inside the orchestra was silent and the audience was just beginning to emerge released from long imprisonment in their seats they were talking animatedly praising the singers criticizing the costumes and making plans for late suppers he saw daisy almost immediately she was wearing a lavender dress with a little cape of champagnecoloured mink over her bare shoulders and she looked ravishing she emerged from the auditorium at the head of a small clutch of people her own age lloyd was sorry to recognize boy fitzherbert beside her and to see her laugh gaily at something he murmured to her as they stepped down the redcarpeted stairs behind her was the interesting german girl eva rothmann escorted by a tall young man in the kind of military evening dress known as a mess kit eva recognized lloyd and smiled and he spoke to her in german good evening fräulein rothmann i hope you enjoyed the opera very much thank you she replied in the same language i didnt realize you were in the audience boy said amiably i say speak english you lot he sounded slightly drunk he was goodlooking in a dissipated way like a sulkily handsome adolescent or a pedigree dog that is fed too many scraps he had a pleasant manner and probably could be devastatingly charming when he chose eva said in english viscount aberowen this is mr williams we know each other said boy hes at emma daisy said hello lloyd were going slumming lloyd had heard this word before it meant going to the east end to visit low pubs and watch workingclass entertainment such as dog fights boy said i bet williams knows some places lloyd hesitated only a fraction of a second was he willing to put up with boy in order to be with daisy of course he was as a matter of fact i do he said do you want me to show you splendid an older woman appeared and wagged a finger at boy you must have these girls home by midnight she said in an american accent not a second later please lloyd guessed she must be daisys mother the tall man in the military outfit replied leave it to the army mrs peshkov well be on time behind mrs peshkov came earl fitzherbert with a fat woman who must be his wife lloyd would have liked to question the earl about his governments policy on spain two cars were waiting for them outside the earl his wife and daisys mother got into a blackandcream rollsroyce phantom iii boy and his group piled into the other car a darkblue daimler e limousine the royal familys favourite car there were seven young people including lloyd eva seemed to be with the soldier who introduced himself to lloyd as lieutenant jimmy murray the third girl was his sister may and the other boy a slimmer quieter version of boy turned out to be andy fitzherbert lloyd gave the chauffeur directions to the gaiety he noticed that jimmy murray discreetly slipped his arm around evas waist her reaction was to move slightly closer to him obviously they were courting lloyd was happy for her she was not a pretty girl but she was intelligent and charming he liked her and he was glad she had found herself a tall soldier he wondered though how others in this upperclass social set would react if jimmy announced he was going to marry a halfjewish german girl it occurred to him that the others formed two more couples andy and may and annoyingly boy and daisy lloyd was the odd one out not wanting to stare at them he studied the polished mahogany window surrounds the car went up ludgate hill to st pauls cathedral take cheapside lloyd said to the driver boy took a long pull from a silver hip flask wiping his mouth he said you know your way around williams i live here said lloyd i was born in the east end how splendid said boy and lloyd was not sure whether he was being thoughtlessly polite or unpleasantly sarcastic all the seats were taken at the gaiety but there was plenty of standing room and the audience moved around constantly greeting friends and going to the bar they were dressed up the women in brightly coloured frocks the men in their best suits the air was warm and smoky and there was a powerful odour of spilled beer lloyd found a place for his group near the back their clothes identified them as visitors from the west end but they were not the only ones music halls were popular with all classes on stage a middleaged performer in a red dress and blonde wig was doing a doubleentendre routine i said to him im not letting you into my passage the audience roared with laughter he said to me i can see it from here love i told him you keep your nose out she was pretending indignation he said it looks to me like it needs a good cleanout well i ask you lloyd saw that daisy was grinning widely he leaned over and murmured in her ear do you realize its a man no she said look at the hands oh my god she said shes a man lloyds cousin david walked past spotted lloyd and came back what are you all dressed up for he said in a cockney accent he was wearing a knotted scarf and a cloth cap hello dave hows life im going to spain with you and lenny griffiths dave said no youre not said lloyd youre fifteen boys my age fought in the great war but they were no use ask your father anyway who says im going your sister millie dave said and he walked on boy said what do people usually drink in this place williams lloyd thought boy did not need any more alcohol but he replied pints of best bitter for the men and portandlemon for the girls portandlemon its port diluted with lemonade how perfectly ghastly boy disappeared the comedian reached the climax of the act i said to him you fool thats the wrong passage she or he went off to gales of applause millie appeared in front of lloyd hello she said she looked at daisy whos your friend lloyd was glad millie looked so pretty in her sophisticated black dress with a row of fake pearls and a discreet touch of makeup he said miss peshkov allow me to present my sister miss leckwith millie this is daisy they shook hands daisy said im very glad to meet lloyds sister halfsister to be exact said millie lloyd explained my father was killed in the great war i never knew him my mother married again when i was still a baby enjoy the show millie said turning away then as she left she murmured to lloyd now i see why ruby carter has no chance lloyd groaned inwardly his mother had obviously told the whole family that he was romancing ruby daisy said whos ruby carter shes a maid at chimbleigh you gave her the money to see a dentist i remember so her name is being romantically linked with yours in the imagination of my mother yes daisy laughed at his discomfiture so youre not going to marry a housemaid im not going to marry ruby she might suit you very well lloyd gave her a direct look we dont always fall in love with the most suitable people do we she looked at the stage the show was approaching its end and the entire cast was beginning a familiar song the audience joined in enthusiastically the standing customers at the back linked arms and swayed in time and boys party did likewise when the curtain came down boy still had not reappeared ill look for him lloyd said i think i know where he might be the gaiety had a ladies toilet but the mens was a back yard with an earth closet and several halved oil drums lloyd found boy puking into one of the drums he gave boy a handkerchief to wipe his mouth then took his arm and led him through the emptying theatre and outside to the daimler limousine the others were waiting they all got in and boy immediately fell asleep when they got back to the west end andy fitzherbert told the driver to go first to the murray house in a modest street near trafalgar square getting out of the car with may he said you lot go on ill see may to her door then walk home lloyd presumed that andy was planning a romantic goodnight on mays doorstep they drove on to mayfair as the car was approaching grosvenor square where daisy and eva were living jimmy told the chauffeur just stop at the corner please then he said quietly to lloyd i say williams would you mind taking miss peshkov to the door and ill follow with fräulein rothmann in half a minute of course jimmy wanted to kiss eva goodnight in the car obviously boy would know nothing about it he was snoring the chauffeur would pretend to be oblivious in the expectation of a tip lloyd got out of the car and handed daisy out when she grasped his hand he got a thrill like a mild electric shock he took her arm and they walked slowly along the pavement at the midpoint between two street lamps where the light was dimmest daisy stopped lets give them time she said lloyd said im so glad eva has a paramour me too he took a breath i cant say the same about you and boy fitzherbert he got me presented at court daisy said and i danced with the king in a nightclub it was in all the american newspapers and thats why youre courting him lloyd said incredulously not only he likes all the things i do parties and racehorses and beautiful clothes hes such fun he even has his own airplane none of that means anything lloyd said give him up be my girlfriend instead she looked pleased but she laughed youre crazy she said but i like you i mean it he said desperately i cant stop thinking about you even though youre the last person in the world i should marry she laughed again you say the rudest things i dont know why i talk to you i guess i think youre nice under your clumsy manners im not really clumsy only with you i believe you but im not going to marry a penniless socialist lloyd had opened his heart only to be charmingly rejected and now he felt miserable he looked back at the daimler i wonder how long theyre going to be he said disconsolately daisy said i might kiss a socialist though just to see what its like for a moment he did not react he assumed she was speaking theoretically but a girl would never say something like that theoretically it was an invitation he had almost been stupid enough to miss it he moved closer putting his hands on her small waist she tilted her face up and her beauty took his breath away he bent his head and kissed her mouth softly she did not close her eyes and neither did he he felt tremendously aroused staring into her blue eyes as he moved his lips against hers she opened her mouth slightly and he touched her parted lips with the tip of his tongue a moment later he felt her tongue respond she was still looking at him he was in paradise and he wanted to stay locked in this embrace for all eternity she pressed her body to his he had an erection and he was embarrassed in case she might feel it so he eased back but she pushed forward again and he understood looking into her eyes that she wanted to feel his penis pressed against her soft body the realization heated him unbearably he felt as if he was going to ejaculate and it occurred to him that she might even want him to then he heard the door of the daimler open and jimmy murray speaking with slightly unnatural loudness as if giving a warning lloyd broke the embrace with daisy well she murmured in a surprised tone that was an unexpected pleasure lloyd said hoarsely more than a pleasure then jimmy and eva were beside them and they all walked to the door of mrs peshkovs house it was a grand building with steps up to a covered porch lloyd wondered if the porch might give shelter enough for another kiss but as they climbed the steps the door was opened from the inside by a man in evening dress probably the butler lloyd had spoken to earlier how glad he was that he had made that phone call the two girls said goodnight demurely giving no hint that only seconds ago they both had been locked in passionate embraces then the door closed and they were gone lloyd and jimmy went back down the steps im going to walk from here jimmy said shall i tell the chauffeur to drive you back to the east end you must be three or four miles from home and boy wont care hell sleep until breakfasttime i should think thats thoughtful of you murray and i appreciate it but believe it or not i feel like walking lots to think about as you wish goodnight then goodnight said lloyd and with his mind in a whirl and his erection slowly deflating he turned east and headed for home iv londons social season ended in the middle of august and still boy fitzherbert had not proposed marriage to daisy peshkov daisy was hurt and puzzled everyone knew they were courting they saw one another almost every day earl fitzherbert talked to daisy like a daughter and even the suspicious princess bea had warmed to her boy kissed her whenever he got the chance but said nothing about the future the long series of lavish lunches and dinners glittering parties and balls traditional sporting events and champagne picnics that made up the london season came to an abrupt end many of the new friends daisy had made suddenly left town most of them went to country houses where as far as she could gather they would spend their time hunting foxes stalking deer and shooting birds daisy and olga stayed for eva rothmanns wedding unlike boy jimmy murray was in a rush to marry the woman he loved the ceremony was held at his parents parish church in chelsea daisy felt she had done a great job with eva she had taught her friend how to choose clothes that suited her smart styles without frills in plain strong colours that flattered her dark hair and brown eyes gaining in confidence eva had learned how to use her natural warmth and quick intelligence to charm men and women and jimmy had fallen in love with her he was no movie star but he was tall and craggily attractive he came from a military family with a modest fortune so eva would be comfortable though not rich the british were as prejudiced as anyone else and at first general murray and mrs murray had not been thrilled at the prospect of their son marrying a halfjewish german refugee eva had won them over quickly but many of their friends still expressed coded doubts at the wedding daisy had been told that eva was exotic jimmy was courageous and the murrays were marvellously broadminded all ways of making the best of an unsuitable match jimmy had written formally to dr rothmann in berlin and had received permission to ask eva for her hand in marriage but the german authorities had refused to let the rothmann family come to the wedding eva had said tearfully they hate jews so much youd think theyd be happy to see them leave the country boys father fitz had heard this remark and had later spoken to daisy about it tell your friend eva not to say too much about jews if she can avoid it he had said in the tone of one who gives a friendly warning having a halfjewish wife is not going to help jimmys army career you know daisy had not passed on this unpleasant counsel the happy couple went off to nice for their honeymoon daisy realized with a pang of guilt that she was relieved to get eva off her hands boy and his political pals disliked jews so much that eva was becoming a problem already the friendship between boy and jimmy had ended boy had refused to be jimmys best man after the wedding daisy and olga were invited by the fitzherberts to a shooting party at their country house in wales daisys hopes rose now that eva was out of the way there was nothing to stop boy proposing the earl and princess must surely assume he was on the point of it perhaps they planned for him to do so this weekend daisy and olga went to paddington station on a friday morning and took a train west they crossed the heart of england rich rolling farmland dotted with hamlets each with its stone church spire rising from a stand of ancient trees they had a firstclass carriage to themselves and olga asked daisy what she thought boy might do he must know i like him daisy said ive let him kiss me enough times have you shown any interest in anyone else her mother asked shrewdly daisy suppressed the guilty memory of that brief moment of foolishness with lloyd williams boy could not possibly know about that and anyway she had not seen lloyd again nor had she replied to the three letters he had sent her no one she said then its because of eva said olga and now shes gone the train went through a long tunnel under the estuary of the river severn and when it emerged they were in wales bedraggled sheep grazed the hills and in the cleft of each valley was a small mining town its pithead winding gear rising from a scatter of ugly industrial buildings earl fitzherberts blackandcream rollsroyce was waiting for them at aberowen station the town was dismal daisy thought with small grey stone houses in rows along the steep hillsides they drove a mile or so out of town to the house tŷ gwyn daisy gasped with pleasure as they passed through the gates tŷ gwyn was enormous and elegant with long rows of tall windows in a perfectly classical façade it was set in elaborate gardens of flowers shrubs and specimen trees that clearly were the pride of the earl himself what a joy it would be to be mistress of this house she thought the british aristocracy might no longer rule the world but they had perfected the art of living and daisy longed to be one of them tŷ gwyn meant white house but the place was actually grey and daisy learned why when she touched the stonework with her hand and got coal dust on her fingertips she was given a room called the gardenia suite that evening she and boy sat on the terrace before dinner and watched the sun go down over the purple mountaintop boy smoking a cigar and daisy sipping champagne they were alone for a while but boy said nothing about marriage over the weekend her anxiety grew boy had plenty more chances to speak to her alone she made sure of that on saturday the men went shooting but daisy went out to meet them at the end of the afternoon and she and boy walked back through the woods together on sunday morning the fitzherberts and most of their guests went to the anglican church in the town after the service boy took daisy to a pub called the two crowns where squat broadshouldered miners in flat caps stared at her in her lavender cashmere coat as if boy had brought in a leopard on a leash she told him that she and her mother would soon have to go back to buffalo but he did not take the hint could it simply be that he liked her but not enough to marry her by lunch on sunday she was desperate tomorrow she and her mother were to return to london if boy had not proposed by then his parents would begin to think he was not serious and there would be no more invitations to tŷ gwyn that prospect frightened daisy she had made up her mind to marry boy she wanted to be viscountess aberowen and then one day countess fitzherbert she had always been rich but she craved the respect and deference that went with social status she longed to be addressed as your ladyship she coveted princess beas diamond tiara she wanted to count royalty among her friends she knew boy liked her and there was no doubt about his desire when he kissed her he needs something to spur him on olga murmured to daisy as they drank their afterlunch coffee with the other ladies in the morning room but what there is one thing that never fails with men daisy raised her eyebrows sex she and her mother talked about most things but generally skirted around this subject pregnancy would do it olga said but that only happens for sure when you dont want it what then you need to give him a glimpse of the promised land but not let him in daisy shook her head im not certain but i think he may have already been to the promised land with someone else who i dont know a maid an actress a widow im guessing but he just doesnt have that virginal air youre right he doesnt that means you have to offer him something he cant get from the others something hed do anything for daisy wondered briefly where her mother had got this wisdom having spent her life in a cold marriage perhaps she had done a lot of thinking about how her husband lev had been stolen from her by his mistress marga anyway there was nothing daisy could offer boy that he couldnt get from another girl was there the women were finishing their coffee and heading to their bedrooms for the afternoon nap the men were still in the dining room smoking their cigars but they would follow in a quarter of an hour daisy stood up olga said what are you going to do im not sure she said ill think of something she left the room she was going to go to boys room she had decided but she did not want to say so in case her mother objected she would be waiting for him when he came for his nap the servants also took a break at that time of day so it was unlikely that anyone would come into the room she would have boy on his own then but what would she say or do she did not know she would have to improvise she went to the gardenia suite brushed her teeth dabbed jean naté cologne on her neck and walked quietly along the corridor to boys room no one saw her go in he had a spacious bedroom with a view of misty mountaintops it felt as if it might have been his for many years there were masculine leather chairs pictures of airplanes and racehorses on the wall a cedar wood humidor full of fragrant cigars and a side table with decanters of whisky and brandy and a tray of crystal glasses she pulled open a drawer and saw tŷ gwyn writing paper a bottle of ink and pens and pencils the paper was blue with the fitzherbert crest would that one day be her crest she wondered what boy would say when he found her here would he be pleased take her in his arms and kiss her or would he be angry that his privacy had been invaded and accuse her of snooping she had to take the risk she went into the adjoining dressing room there was a small washbasin with a mirror over it his shaving tackle was on the marble surround daisy thought she would like to learn to shave her husband how intimate that would be she opened the wardrobe doors and looked at his clothes formal morning dress tweed suits riding clothes a leather pilots jacket with a fur lining and two evening suits that gave her an idea she recalled how aroused boy had been at bing westhamptons house back in june by the sight of her and the other girls dressed as men that evening had been the first time he had kissed her she was not sure why he had been so excited such things were generally inexplicable lizzie westhampton said some men liked women to spank their bottoms how could you account for that perhaps she should dress in his clothes now something hed do anything for her mother had said was this it she stared at the row of suits on hangers the stack of folded white shirts the polished leather shoes each with its wooden tree inside would it work did she have time did she have anything to lose she could pick the clothes she needed take them to the gardenia suite change there and then hurry back hoping that no one saw her on the way no there was no time for that his cigar was not long enough she had to change here and fast or not at all she made up her mind she pulled her dress off she was in danger now until this moment she might have explained her presence here just about plausibly by pretending that she had lost her bearings in tŷ gwyns miles of corridors and gone into the wrong room by mistake but no girls reputation could survive being found in a mans room in her underwear she took the top shirt off the pile the collar had to be attached with a stud she saw with a groan she found a dozen starched collars in a drawer with a box of studs and fixed one to the shirt then pulled the shirt over her head she heard a mans heavy footsteps in the corridor outside and froze her heart beating like a big drum but the steps went by she decided to wear formal morning dress the striped trousers had no suspenders attached but she found some in another drawer she figured out how to button the suspenders to the trousers then pulled the trousers on the waist was big enough for two of her she pushed her stockinged feet into a pair of shiny black shoes and laced them she buttoned the shirt and put on a silver tie the knot was wrong but it did not matter and anyway she did not know the correct way to tie it so she left it as it was she put on a fawn doublebreasted waistcoat and a black tailcoat then she looked in the fulllength mirror on the inside of the wardrobe door the clothes were baggy but she looked cute anyway now that she had time she put gold links in the shirt cuffs and a white handkerchief in the breast pocket of the coat something was missing she stared at herself in the mirror until she figured out what else she needed a hat she opened another cupboard and saw a row of hatboxes on a high shelf she found a grey top hat and perched it on the back of her head she remembered the moustache she did not have an eyebrow pencil with her she returned to boys bedroom and bent over the fireplace it was still summer and there was no fire she got some soot on her fingertip returned to the mirror and carefully drew a moustache on her upper lip she was ready she sat in one of the leather armchairs to wait for him her instinct told her she was doing the right thing but rationally it seemed bizarre however there was no accounting for arousal she herself had got wet inside when he took her up in his plane it had been impossible for them to canoodle while he was concentrating on flying the little aircraft and that was just as well for soaring through the air had been so exciting that probably she would have let him do anything he wanted however boys could be unpredictable and she feared he might be angry when that happened his handsome face would twist into an unattractive grimace he would tap his foot very quickly and he could become quite cruel once when a waiter with a limp had brought him the wrong drink he had said just hobble back to the bar and bring me the scotch i ordered being a cripple doesnt make you deaf does it the wretched man had flushed with shame she wondered what boy would say to her if he was angered by her being in his room he arrived five minutes later she heard his tread outside and realized she already knew him well enough to recognize his step the door opened and he came in without seeing her she put on a deep voice and said hello old chap how are you he started and said good god then he looked again daisy she stood up the same she said in her normal voice he was still staring at her in surprise she doffed the top hat gave a little bow and said at your service she replaced the hat on her head at an angle after a long moment he recovered from the shock and grinned thank god she thought he said i say that topper does suit you she came closer i put it on to please you jolly nice of you i must say she turned her face up invitingly she liked kissing him in truth she liked kissing most men she was secretly embarrassed by how much she liked it she had even enjoyed kissing girls at her boarding school where they did not see a boy for weeks on end he bent his head and touched his lips to hers her hat fell off and they both giggled quickly he thrust his tongue into her mouth she relaxed and enjoyed it he was enthusiastic about all sensual pleasures and she was excited by his eagerness she reminded herself that she had a purpose things were progressing nicely but she wanted him to propose would he be satisfied with just a kiss she needed him to want more often if they had more than a few hasty moments he would fondle her breasts a lot depended on how much wine he had drunk with lunch he had a large capacity but there came a point when he lost the urge she moved her body pressing herself to him he put a hand on her chest but she was wearing a baggy waistcoat of woollen cloth and he could not find her small breasts he grunted in frustration then his hand roamed across her stomach and inside the waistband of the loosefitting trousers she had never before let him touch her down there she still had on a silk petticoat and substantial cotton underdrawers so he surely could not feel much but his hand went to the fork of her thighs and pressed firmly against her through the layers she felt a twinge of pleasure she pulled away from him panting he said have i gone too far lock the door she said oh my goodness he went to the door turned the key in the lock and came back they embraced again and he resumed where he had left off she touched the front of his trousers found his erect penis through the cloth and grasped it firmly he groaned with pleasure she pulled away again the shadow of anger crossed his face an unpleasant memory came back to her once when she had made a boy called theo coffman take his hand off her breasts he had turned nasty and called her a prickteaser she had never seen that boy again but the insult had made her feel irrationally ashamed momentarily she feared that boy might be about to make a similar accusation then his face softened and he said i am dreadfully keen on you yknow this was her moment sink or swim she told herself we shouldnt be doing this she said with a regret that was not greatly exaggerated why not were not even engaged the word hung in the air for a long moment for a girl to say that was tantamount to a proposal she watched his face terrified that he would take fright turn away mumble excuses and ask her to leave he said nothing i want to make you happy she said but i do love you daisy he said that was not enough she smiled at him and said do you ever such a lot she said nothing but looked at him expectantly at last he said will you marry me oh yes she said and she kissed him again with her mouth pressed to his she unbuttoned his fly burrowed through his underclothing found his penis and took it out the skin was silky and hot she stroked it remembering a conversation with the westhampton twins you can rub his thing lindy had said and lizzie had added until it squirts daisy was intrigued and excited by the idea of making a man do that she grasped a bit harder then she remembered lindys next remark or you can suck it they like that best of all she moved her lips away from boys and spoke into his ear ill do anything for my husband she said then she knelt down v it was the wedding of the year daisy and boy were married at st margarets church westminster on saturday october daisy was disappointed it was not westminster abbey but she was told that was for the royal family only coco chanel made her wedding dress depression fashion was for simple lines and minimal extravagance daisys floorlength biascut satin gown had pretty butterfly sleeves and a short train that could be carried by one pageboy her father lev peshkov came across the atlantic for the ceremony her mother olga agreed for the sake of appearances to sit beside him in church and generally pretend that they were a more or less happily married couple daisys nightmare was that at some point marga would show up with levs illegitimate son greg on her arm but it did not happen the westhampton twins and may murray were bridesmaids and eva murray was matron of honour boy had been grumpy about evas being half jewish he had not wanted to invite her at all but daisy had insisted she stood in the ancient church conscious that she looked heartbreakingly beautiful and happily gave herself to boy fitzherbert body and soul she signed the register daisy fitzherbert viscountess aberowen she had been practising that signature for weeks carefully tearing the paper into unreadable shreds afterwards now she was entitled to it it was her name processing out of the church fitz took olgas arm amiably but princess bea put a yard of empty space between herself and lev princess bea was not a nice person she was friendly enough towards daisys mother and if there was a heavy strain of condescension in her tone olga did not notice it so relations were amiable but bea did not like lev daisy now realized that lev lacked the veneer of social respectability he walked and talked ate and drank smoked and laughed and scratched like a gangster and he did not care what people thought he did what he liked because he was an american millionaire just as fitz did what he liked because he was an english earl daisy had always known this but it struck her with extra force when she saw her father with all these upperclass english people at the wedding breakfast in the grand ballroom of the dorchester hotel but it did not matter now she was lady aberowen and that could not be taken away from her nevertheless beas constant hostility to lev was an irritant like a slightly bad smell or a distant buzzing noise giving daisy a feeling of dissatisfaction sitting beside lev at the top table bea constantly turned slightly away when he spoke to her she replied briefly without meeting his eye he seemed not to notice smiling and drinking champagne but daisy seated on levs other side knew that he had not failed to read the signs he was uncouth not stupid when the toasts were over and the men began to smoke lev who as the father of the bride was paying the bill looked along the table and said well fitz i hope you enjoyed your meal were the wines up to your standards very good thank you i must say i thought it was a damn fine spread bea tutted audibly men were not supposed to say damn in her hearing lev turned to her he was smiling but daisy knew the dangerous look in his eye why princess have i offended you she did not want to reply but he looked expectantly at her and did not turn his gaze aside at last she spoke i prefer not to hear coarse language she said lev took a cigar from his case he did not light it at once but sniffed it and rolled it between his fingers let me tell you a story he said and he looked up and down the table to make sure they were all listening fitz olga boy daisy and bea when i was a kid my father was accused of grazing livestock on someone elses land no big deal you might think even if he was guilty but he was arrested and the land agent built a scaffold in the north meadow then the soldiers came and grabbed me and my brother and our mother and took us there my father was on the scaffold with a noose around his neck then the landlord arrived daisy had never heard this story she looked at her mother olga seemed equally surprised the little group at the table were all silent now we were forced to watch while my father was hanged lev said he turned to bea and you know something strange the landlords sister was there as well he put the cigar in his mouth wetting the end and took it out again daisy saw that bea had turned pale was this about her the sister was about nineteen years old and she was a princess lev said looking at his cigar daisy heard bea let out a small cry and realized that this story was about her she stood there and watched the hanging cold as ice lev said then he looked directly at bea now thats what i call coarse he said there was a long moment of silence then lev put the cigar back in his mouth and said has anyone got a light vi lloyd williams sat at the table in the kitchen of his mothers house in aldgate anxiously studying a map it was sunday october and today there was going to be a riot the old roman town of london built on a hill beside the river thames was now the financial district called the city west of this hill were the palaces of the rich and the theatres and shops and cathedrals that catered to them the house in which lloyd sat was to the east of the hill near the docks and the slums here for centuries waves of immigrants had landed determined to work their fingers to the bone so that their grandchildren could one day move from the east end to the west end the map lloyd was looking at so intently was in a special edition of the daily worker the communist party newspaper and it showed the route of todays march by the british union of fascists they planned to assemble outside the tower of london on the border between the city and the east end then march east straight into the overwhelmingly jewish borough of stepney unless lloyd and people who thought as he did could stop them there were jews in britain according to the newspaper and half of them lived in the east end most were refugees from russia poland and germany where they had lived in fear that on any day the police the army or the cossacks might ride into town robbing families beating old men and outraging young women lining fathers and brothers up against the wall to be shot here in the london slums those jews had found a place where they had as much right to live as anyone else how would they feel if they looked out of their windows to see marching down their own streets a gang of uniformed thugs sworn to wipe them all out lloyd felt that it just could not be allowed to happen the worker pointed out that from the tower there were really only two routes the marchers could take one went through gardiners corner a fiveway junction known as the gateway to the east end the other led along royal mint street and the narrow cable street there were a dozen other routes for an individual using side streets but not for a march st george street led to catholic wapping rather than jewish stepney and was therefore no use to the fascists the worker called for a human wall to block gardiners corner and cable street and stop the march the paper often called for things that did not happen strikes revolutions or most recently an alliance of all left parties to form a peoples front the human wall might be just another fantasy it would take many thousands of people to effectively close off the east end lloyd did not know whether enough would show up all he knew for sure was that there would be trouble at the table with lloyd were his parents bernie and ethel his sister millie and sixteenyearold lenny griffiths from aberowen in his sunday suit lenny was part of a small army of welsh miners who had come to london to join the counterdemonstration bernie looked up from his newspaper and said to lenny the fascists claim that the train fares for all you welshmen to come to london have been paid by the big jews lenny swallowed a mouthful of fried egg i dont know any big jews he said unless you count mrs levy sweetshop shes quite big anyway i came to london on the back of a lorry with sixty welsh lambs going to smithfield meat market millie said that accounts for the smell ethel said millie how rude lenny was sharing lloyds bedroom and he had confided that after the demonstration he was not planning to return to aberowen he and dave williams were going to spain to join the international brigades being formed to fight the fascist insurrection did you get a passport lloyd had asked getting a passport was not difficult but the applicant did have to provide a reference from a clergyman doctor lawyer or other person of status so a young person could not easily keep it secret no need lenny said we go to victoria station and get a weekend return ticket to paris you can do that without a passport lloyd had vaguely known that it was a loophole intended for the convenience of the prosperous middle class now the antifascists were taking advantage of it how much is the ticket three pounds fifteen shillings lloyd had raised his eyebrows that was more money than an unemployed coal miner was likely to have lenny had added but the independent labour party is paying for my ticket and the communist party for daves they must have lied about their ages then what happens when you get to paris lloyd had asked well be met by the french communists at the gare du nord he pronounced it gair duh nord he did not speak a word of french from there well be escorted to the spanish border lloyd had delayed his own departure he told people he wanted to soothe his parents worries but the truth was he could not give up on daisy he still dreamed of her throwing boy over it was hopeless she did not even answer his letters but he could not forget her meanwhile britain france and the usa had agreed with germany and italy to adopt a policy of nonintervention in spain which meant that none of them would supply weapons to either side this in itself was infuriating to lloyd surely the democracies should support the elected government but what was worse germany and italy were breaching the agreement every day as lloyds mother and uncle billy pointed out at many public meetings held that autumn in britain to discuss spain earl fitzherbert as the government minister responsible defended the policy stoutly saying that the spanish government should not be armed for fear it would go communist this was a selffulfilling prophecy as ethel had argued in a scathing speech the one nation willing to support the government of spain was the soviet union and the spaniards would naturally gravitate towards the only country in the world that helped them the truth was that the conservatives felt spain had elected people who were dangerously leftwing men such as fitzherbert would not be unhappy if the spanish government was violently overthrown and replaced by rightwing extremists lloyd seethed with frustration then had come this chance to fight fascism at home its ridiculous bernie had said a week ago when the march had been announced the metropolitan police must force them to change the route they have the right to march of course but not in stepney however the police said they did not have the power to interfere with a perfectly legal demonstration bernie and ethel and the mayors of eight london boroughs had been in a delegation that begged the home secretary sir john simon to ban the march or at least divert it but he too claimed he had no power to act the question of what to do next had split the labour party the jewish community and the williams family the jewish peoples council against fascism and antisemitism founded by bernie and others three months ago had called for a massive counterdemonstration that would keep the fascists out of jewish streets their slogan was the spanish phrase no pasaran meaning they shall not pass the cry of the antifascist defenders of madrid the council was a small organization with a grand name it occupied two upstairs rooms in a building on commercial road and it owned a gestetner duplicating machine and a couple of old typewriters but it commanded huge support in the east end in fortyeight hours it had collected an incredible hundred thousand signatures on a petition calling for the march to be banned still the government did nothing only one major political party supported the counterdemonstration and that was the communists the protest was also backed by the fringe independent labour party to which lenny belonged the other parties were against ethel said i see the jewish chronicle has advised its readers to stay off the streets today this was the problem in lloyds opinion a lot of people were taking the view that it was best to keep out of trouble but that would give the fascists a free hand bernie who was jewish though not religious said to ethel how can you quote the jewish chronicle at me it believes jews should not be against fascism just antisemitism what kind of political sense does that make i hear that the board of deputies of british jews says the same as the chronicle ethel persisted apparently there was an announcement yesterday in all the synagogues those socalled deputies are alrightniks from golders green bernie said with contempt theyve never been insulted on the streets by fascist hooligans youre in the labour party ethel said accusingly our policy is not to confront the fascists on the streets wheres your solidarity bernie said what about solidarity with my fellow jews youre only jewish when it suits you and youve never been abused on the street all the same the labour party has made a political mistake just remember if you allow the fascists to provoke violence the press will blame the left for it regardless of who really started it lenny said rashly if mosleys boys start a fight theyll get whats coming to them ethel sighed think about it lenny in this country whos got the most guns you and lloyd and the labour party or the conservatives with the army and the police on their side oh said lenny clearly he had not considered that lloyd said angrily to his mother how can you talk like that you were in berlin three years ago you saw how it was the german left tried to oppose fascism peacefully and look what happened to them bernie put in the german social democrats failed to form a popular front with the communists that allowed them to be picked off separately together they might have won bernie had been angry when the local labour party branch had refused an offer from the communists to form a coalition against the march ethel said an alliance with communists is a dangerous thing she and bernie disagreed on this in fact it was an issue that split the labour party lloyd thought that bernie was right and ethel wrong we have to use every resource weve got to defeat fascism he said then he added diplomatically but mams right it will be best for us if today goes off without violence it will be best if you all stay home and oppose the fascists through the normal channels of democratic politics ethel said you tried to get equal pay for women through the normal channels of democratic politics lloyd said you failed only last april women labour mps had promoted a parliamentary bill to guarantee female government employees equal pay for equal work it had been voted down by the maledominated house of commons you dont give up on democracy every time you lose a vote ethel said crisply the trouble was lloyd knew that these divisions could fatally weaken the antifascist forces as had happened in germany today would be a harsh test political parties could try to lead but the people would choose whom to follow would they stay at home as urged by the timid labour party and the jewish chronicle or would they come out on to the streets in their thousands and say no to fascism by the end of the day he would know the answer there was a knock at the back door and their neighbour sean dolan came in dressed in his churchgoing suit ill be joining you after mass he said to bernie where should we meet up gardiners corner not later than two oclock said bernie were hoping to have enough people to stop the fascists there youll have every dock worker in the east end with you said sean enthusiastically millie asked why is that the fascists dont hate you do they youre too young to remember you darlin girl but the jews have always supported us sean explained in the dock strike of when i was only nine years old my father couldnt feed us and me and my brother were taken in by mrs isaacs the bakers wife in new road may god bless her great big heart hundreds of dockers children were looked after by jewish families then it was the same in were not going to let the bloody fascists come down our streets excuse my language mrs leckwith lloyd was heartened there were thousands of dockers in the east end if they showed up en masse it would hugely swell the ranks from outside the house came the sound of a loudspeaker keep mosley out of stepney said a mans voice assemble at gardiners corner at two oclock lloyd drank his tea and stood up his role today was to be a spy checking the position of the fascists and calling in updates to bernies jewish peoples council his pockets were heavy with big brown pennies for public phones id better get started he said the fascists are probably assembling already his mother got up and followed him to the door dont get into a fight she said remember what happened in berlin ill be careful lloyd said she tried a light tone your rich american girl wont like you with no teeth she doesnt like me anyway i dont believe it what girl could resist you ill be all right mam lloyd said really i will i suppose i should be glad youre not going to bloody spain not today anyway lloyd kissed his mother and went out it was a bright autumn morning the sun unseasonably warm in the middle of nutley street a temporary platform had been set up by a group of men one of whom was speaking through a megaphone people of the east end we do not have to stand quiet while a crowd of strutting antisemites insults us lloyd recognized the speaker as a local official of the national unemployed workers movement because of the depression there were thousands of unemployed jewish tailors they signed on every day at the settle street labour exchange before lloyd had gone ten yards bernie came after him and handed him a paper bag of the little glass balls that children called marbles ive been in a lot of demonstrations he said if the mounted police charge the crowd throw these under the horses hooves lloyd smiled his stepfather was a peacemaker almost all the time but he was no softie all the same lloyd was dubious about the marbles he had never had much to do with horses but they seemed to him to be patient harmless beasts and he did not like the idea of causing them to crash to the ground bernie read the look on his face and said better a horse should fall than my boy should be trampled lloyd put the marbles in his pocket thinking that it did not commit him to using them he was pleased to see many people already on the streets he noted other encouraging signs the slogan they shall not pass in english and spanish had been chalked on walls everywhere he looked the communists were out in force handing out leaflets red flags draped many windowsills a group of men wearing medals from the great war carried a banner that read jewish exservicemens association fascists hated to be reminded how many jews had fought for britain five jewish soldiers had won the countrys highest medal for bravery the victoria cross lloyd began to think that perhaps there would be enough people to stop the march after all gardiners corner was a broad fiveway junction named for the scottish clothing store gardiner and company which occupied a corner building with a distinctive clock tower when he got there lloyd saw that trouble was expected there were several first aid stations and hundreds of st john ambulance volunteers in their uniforms ambulances were parked in every side street lloyd hoped there would be no fighting but better to risk violence he thought than to let the fascists march unhindered he took a roundabout route and came towards the tower of london from the northwest in order not to be identified as an east ender some minutes before he got there he could hear the brass bands the tower was a riverside palace that had symbolized authority and repression for eight hundred years it was surrounded by a long wall of pale old stone that looked as if the colour had been washed out of it by centuries of london rain outside the walls on the landward side was a park called tower gardens and here the fascists were assembling he estimated that there were already a couple of thousand of them in a line that stretched back westward into the financial district every now and again they broke into a rhythmic chant one two three four were gonna get rid of the yids the yids the yids were gonna get rid of the yids they carried union jack flags why was it lloyd wondered that the people who wanted to destroy everything good about their country were the quickest to wave the national flag they looked impressively military in their wide black leather belts and black shirts as they formed neat columns across the grass their officers wore a smart uniform a black militarycut jacket grey riding breeches jackboots a black cap with a shiny peak and a redandwhite armband several motorcyclists in uniform roared around ostentatiously delivering messages with fascist salutes more marchers were arriving some of them in armoured vans with wire mesh at the windows this was not a political party it was an army the purpose of the display lloyd figured was to give them false authority they wanted to look as if they had the right to close meetings and empty buildings to burst into homes and offices and arrest people to drag them to jails and camps and beat them up interrogate and torture them as the brownshirts did in germany under the nazi regime so admired by mosley and the daily mails proprietor lord rothermere they would terrify the people of the east end people whose parents and grandparents had fled from repression and pogroms in ireland and poland and russia would east enders come out on the streets and fight them if not if todays march went ahead as planned what might the fascists dare tomorrow he walked around the edge of the park pretending to be one of the hundred or so casual onlookers side streets radiated from the hublike spokes in one of them he noticed a familiarlooking blackandcream rollsroyce drawing up the chauffeur opened the rear door and to lloyds shock and dismay daisy peshkov got out there was no doubt why she was here she was wearing a beautifully tailored female version of the uniform with a long grey skirt instead of the breeches her fair curls escaping from under the black cap much as he hated the outfit lloyd could not help finding her irresistibly alluring he stopped and stared he should not have been surprised daisy had told him she liked boy fitzherbert and boys politics clearly made no difference to that but to see her obviously supporting the fascists in their attack on jewish londoners rammed home to him how utterly alien she was from everything that mattered in his life he should simply have turned away but he could not as she hurried along the pavement he blocked her way what the devil are you doing here he said brusquely she was cool i might ask you the same question mr williams she said i dont suppose youre intending to march with us dont you understand what these people are like they break up peaceful political meetings they bully journalists they imprison their political rivals youre an american how can you be against democracy democracy is not necessarily the most appropriate political system for every country in all times she was quoting mosleys propaganda lloyd guessed he said but these people torture and kill everyone who disagrees with them he thought of jörg ive seen it for myself in berlin i was in one of their camps briefly i was forced to watch while a naked man was savaged to death by starving dogs thats the kind of thing your fascist friends do she was unintimidated and who exactly has been killed by fascists here in england recently the british fascists havent got the power yet but your mosley admires hitler if they ever get the chance theyll do exactly the same as the nazis you mean they will eliminate unemployment and give the people pride and hope lloyd was drawn to her so powerfully that it broke his heart to hear her spouting this rubbish you know what the nazis have done to the family of your friend eva eva got married did you know daisy said in the determinedly cheerful tone of one who tries to switch a dinnertable conversation to a more agreeable topic to nice jimmy murray shes an english wife now and her parents daisy looked away i dont know them but you know what the nazis have done to them eva had told lloyd all about it at the trinity ball her father is no longer allowed to practise medicine hes working as an assistant in a pharmacy he cant enter a park or a public library his fathers name has been scraped off the war memorial in his home village lloyd realized he had raised his voice more quietly he said how can you possibly stand side by side with people who do such things she looked troubled but she did not answer his question instead she said im late already please excuse me what youre doing cant be excused the chauffeur said all right sonny thats enough he was a heavy middleaged man who evidently took little exercise and lloyd was not in the least intimidated but he did not want to start a fight im leaving he said in a mild tone but dont call me sonny the chauffeur took his arm lloyd said youd better take your hand off me or ill knock you down before i go he looked into the chauffeurs face the chauffeur hesitated lloyd tensed preparing to react watching for warning signs as he would in the boxing ring if the chauffeur tried to hit him it would be a great swinging haymaker of a blow easily dodged but the man either sensed lloyds readiness or felt the welldeveloped muscle in the arm he was holding for one reason or the other he backed off and released his grip saying no need for threats daisy walked away lloyd looked at her back in the perfectly fitting uniform as she hurried towards the ranks of the fascists with a deep sigh of frustration he turned and went in the other direction he tried to concentrate on the job at hand what a fool he had been to threaten the chauffeur if he had got into a fight he would probably have been arrested then he would have spent the day in a police cell and how would that have helped defeat fascism it was now half past twelve he left tower hill found a telephone box called the jewish peoples council and spoke to bernie after he had reported what he had seen bernie told him to make an estimate of the number of policemen in the streets between the tower and gardiners corner he crossed to the east side of the park and explored the radiating side streets what he saw astonished him he had expected a hundred or so police in fact there were thousands they stood lining the pavements waited in dozens of parked buses and sat astride huge horses in remarkably neat rows only a narrow gap was left for people who wanted to walk along the streets there were more police than fascists from inside one of the buses a uniformed constable gave him the hitler salute lloyd was dismayed if all these policemen sided with the fascists how could the counterdemonstrators resist them this was worse than a fascist march it was a fascist march with police authority what kind of message did that send to the jews of the east end in mansell street he saw a beat policeman he knew henry clark hello nobby he said for some reason all clarks were called nobby a copper just gave me the hitler salute theyre not from round here nobby said quietly as if revealing a confidence they dont live with jews like i do i tell them jews are the same as everyone else mostly decent lawabiding people a few villains and troublemakers but they dont believe me all the same the hitler salute might have been a joke lloyd did not think so he left nobby and moved on the police were forming cordons where the side streets entered the area around gardiners corner he saw he went into a pub with a phone he had scouted all the available telephones the day before and told bernie there were at least five thousand policemen in the neighbourhood we cant resist that many coppers he said gloomily dont be so sure bernie said have a look at gardiners corner lloyd found a way around the police cordon and joined the counterdemonstration it was not until he got into the middle of the street outside gardiners that he could appreciate the full extent of the crowd it was the largest gathering of people he had ever seen the fiveway junction was jammed but that was the least of it the crowd stretched east along whitechapel high street as far as the eye could see commercial road which ran southeast was also crammed leman street where the police station stood was impenetrable there must be a hundred thousand people here lloyd thought he wanted to throw his hat in the air and cheer east enders had come out in force to repel the fascists there could be no doubt about their feelings now in the middle of the junction stood a stationary tram abandoned by its driver and passengers nothing could pass through this crowd lloyd realized with mounting optimism he saw his neighbour sean dolan climb a lamp post and fix a red flag to its top the jewish lads brigade brass band was playing probably without the knowledge of the respectable conservative organizers of the club a police aircraft flew overhead an autogyro of some kind lloyd thought near the windows of gardiners he ran into his sister millie and her friend naomi avery he did not want millie to become involved in any rough stuff the thought chilled his heart does dad know youve come he said in a tone of reproof she was insouciant dont be daft she replied he was surprised she was there at all youre not usually very political he said i thought you were more interested in making money i am she said but this is special lloyd could imagine how upset bernie would be if millie got hurt i think you should go home why he looked around the crowd was amiable and peaceful the police were some distance away the fascists nowhere to be seen there would be no march today that was clear mosleys people could not force their way through a crowd of a hundred thousand people determined to stop them and the police would be insane to let them try millie was probably quite safe just as he was thinking this everything changed several whistles shrilled looking in the direction of the sound lloyd saw the mounted police drawn up in an ominous line the horses were stamping and blowing in agitation the police had drawn long clubs shaped like swords they seemed to be getting ready to attack but surely that could not be so next moment they charged there were angry shouts and terrified screams from the people everyone scrambled to get out of the way of the giant horses the crowd made a path but those at the edge fell under the pounding hooves the police lashed out left and right with their long clubs lloyd was pushed helplessly backwards he felt furious what did the police think they were doing were they stupid enough to believe they could clear a path for mosley to march along did they really imagine that two or three thousand fascists chanting insults could pass through a crowd of a hundred thousand of their victims without starting a riot were the police led by idiots or out of control he was not sure which would be worse they backed away wheeling their panting horses and regrouped forming a ragged line then a whistle blew and they heeled the flanks of their mounts urging them into another reckless charge millie was scared now she was only sixteen and her bravado had gone she screamed with fear as the crowd squeezed her up against the plateglass window of gardiner and company tailors dummies in cheap suits and winter coats stared out at the horrified crowd and the warlike riders lloyd was deafened by the roar of thousands of voices yelling in fearful protest he got in front of millie and pushed against the press with all his might trying to protect her but it was in vain despite his efforts he was crushed against her forty or fifty screaming people had their backs to the window and the pressure was building dangerously lloyd realized with rage that the police were determined to make a pathway through the crowd regardless of the cost a moment later there was a terrific crash of breaking glass and the window gave way lloyd fell on top of millie and naomi fell on him dozens of people cried out in pain and panic lloyd struggled to his feet miraculously he was unhurt he looked around frantically for his sister it was maddeningly difficult to distinguish the people from the tailors dummies then he spotted millie lying in a mess of broken glass he grasped her arms and pulled her to her feet she was crying my back she said he turned her around her coat was cut to ribbons and there was blood all over her he felt sick with anguish he put his arm around her shoulders protectively theres an ambulance just around the corner he said can you walk they had gone only a few yards when the police whistles blew again lloyd was terrified that he and millie would be shoved back into gardiners window then he remembered what bernie had given him he took the paper bag of marbles from his pocket the police charged drawing back his arm lloyd threw the paper bag over the heads of the crowd to land in front of the horses he was not the only one so equipped and several other people threw marbles as the horses came at them there was the sound of firecrackers a police horse slipped on marbles and went down others stopped and reared at the banging of the fireworks the police charge turned into chaos naomi avery had somehow pushed to the front of the crowd and he saw her burst a bag of pepper under the nose of a horse causing it to veer away shaking its head frantically the crush eased and lloyd led millie around the corner she was still in pain but she had stopped crying a line of people were waiting for attention from the st johns ambulance volunteers a weeping girl whose hand appeared to have been crushed several young men with bleeding heads and faces a middleaged woman sitting on the ground nursing a swollen knee as lloyd and millie arrived sean dolan walked away with a bandage around his head and went straight back into the crowd a nurse looked at millies back this is bad she said you need to go to the london hospital well take you in an ambulance she looked at lloyd do you want to go with her lloyd did but he was supposed to be phoning in reports and he hesitated millie solved the dilemma for him with characteristic spunk dont you dare come she said you cant do anything for me and youve got important work to do here she was right he helped her into a parked ambulance are you sure yes im sure try not to end up in hospital yourself he was leaving her in the best hands he decided he kissed her cheek and returned to the fray the police had changed their tactics the people had repelled the horse charges but the police were still determined to make a path through the crowd as lloyd pushed his way to the front they charged on foot attacking with their batons the unarmed demonstrators cowered back from them liked piled leaves in a wind then surged forward in a different part of the line the police started to arrest people perhaps hoping to weaken the crowds determination by taking ringleaders away in the east end being arrested was no legal formality few people came back without a black eye or a few gaps in their teeth leman street police station had a particularly bad reputation lloyd found himself behind a vociferous young woman carrying a red flag he recognized olive bishop a neighbour in nutley street a policeman hit her over the head with his truncheon screaming jewish whore she was not jewish and she certainly was not a whore in fact she played the piano at the calvary gospel hall but she had forgotten the admonition of jesus to turn the other cheek and she scratched the cops face drawing parallel red lines on his skin two more officers grabbed her arms and held her while the scratched man hit her on the head again the sight of three strong men attacking one girl maddened lloyd he stepped forward and hit the womans assailant with a right hook that had all of his rage behind it the blow landed on the policemans temple dazed the man stumbled and fell more officers converged on the scene lashing out randomly with their clubs hitting arms and legs and heads and hands four of them picked up olive each taking an arm or a leg she screamed and wriggled desperately but she could not get free but the bystanders were not passive they attacked the police carrying the girl off trying to pull the uniformed men away from her the police turned on their attackers yelling jew bastards even though not all their assailants were jews and one was a blackskinned somali sailor the police let go of olive dropping her to the road and began to defend themselves olive pushed through the crowd and vanished the cops retreated hitting out at anyone within reach as they backed away lloyd saw with a thrill of triumph that the police strategy was not working for all their brutality the attacks had completely failed to make a way through the crowd another baton charge began but the angry crowd surged forward to meet it eager now for combat lloyd decided it was time for another report he worked his way backwards through the crush and found a phone box i dont think theyre going to succeed dad he told bernie excitedly theyre trying to beat a path through us but theyre making no progress were too many were redirecting people to cable street bernie said the police may be about to switch their thrust thinking they have more chance there so were sending reinforcements go along there see whats happening and let me know right said lloyd and he hung up before realizing he had not told his stepfather that millie had been taken to hospital but perhaps it was better not to worry him right now getting to cable street was not going to be easy from gardiners corner leman street led directly south to the near end of cable street a distance of less than half a mile but the road was jammed by demonstrators fighting with police lloyd had to take a less direct route he struggled eastward through the crowd into commercial road once there further progress was not much easier there were no police therefore there was no violence but the crowd was almost as dense it was frustrating but lloyd was consoled for his difficulties by the reflection that the police would never force a way through so many he wondered what daisy peshkov was doing probably she was sitting in the car waiting for the march to begin tapping the toe of her expensive shoe impatiently on the rollsroyces carpet the thought that he was helping to frustrate her purpose gave him an oddly spiteful sense of satisfaction with persistence and a slightly ruthless attitude to those in his way lloyd pushed through the throng the railway that ran along the north side of cable street obstructed his route and he had to walk some distance before reaching a side road that tunnelled beneath the line he passed under the tracks and entered cable street the crowd here was not so closely packed but the street was narrow and passage was still difficult that was a good thing it would be even more difficult for the police to get through but there was another obstruction he saw a lorry had been parked across the road and turned on its side at either end of the vehicle the barricade had been extended the full width of the street with old tables and chairs odd lengths of timber and other assorted rubbish piled high a barricade it made lloyd think of the french revolution but this was no revolution the people of the east end did not want to overthrow the british government on the contrary they were deeply attached to their elections and their borough councils and their houses of parliament they liked their system of government so much that they were determined to defend it against fascism even if it would not defend itself he had emerged behind the barrier and now he moved towards it to see what was happening he stood on a wall to get a better view he saw a lively scene on the far side police were trying to dismantle the blockage picking up broken furniture and dragging old mattresses away but they were not having an easy time of it a hail of missiles fell on their helmets some hurled from behind the barricade some thrown from the upstairs windows of the houses packed closely on either side of the street stones milk bottles broken pots and bricks that came lloyd saw from a nearby builders yard a few daring young men stood on top of the barricade lashing out at the police with sticks and occasionally a fight broke out as the police tried to pull one down and give him a kicking with a start lloyd recognized two of the figures standing on the barricade as dave williams his cousin and lenny griffiths from aberowen side by side they were fighting policemen off with shovels but as the minutes passed lloyd saw that the police were winning they were working systematically picking up the components of the barricade and taking them away on this side a few people reinforced the wall replacing what the police removed but they were less organized and did not have an infinite supply of materials it looked to lloyd as if the police would soon prevail and if they could clear cable street they would let the fascists march down here past one jewish shop after another then looking behind him he saw that whoever was organizing the defence of cable street was thinking ahead even while the police dismantled the barricade another was going up a few hundred yards farther along the street lloyd retreated and began enthusiastically to help build the second wall dockers with pickaxes were prising up paving stones housewives dragged dustbins from their yards and shopkeepers brought empty crates and boxes lloyd helped carry a park bench then pulled down a noticeboard from outside a municipal building learning from experience the builders did a better job this time using their materials economically and making sure the structure was sturdy looking behind him again lloyd saw that a third barricade was beginning to rise farther east the people began to retreat from the first one and regroup behind the second a few minutes later the police at last made a gap in the first barricade and poured through it the first of them went after the few young men remaining and lloyd saw dave and lenny chased down an alley the houses on either side were swiftly shut up doors slamming and windows closing then lloyd saw the police did not know what to do next they had broken through the barricade only to be confronted with another stronger one they seemed not to have the heart to begin dismantling the second they milled around in the middle of cable street talking desultorily looking resentfully at the residents watching them from upstairs windows it was too early to proclaim victory but all the same lloyd could not suppress a happy feeling of success it was beginning to look as if the antifascists were going to win the day he remained at his post for another quarter of an hour but the police did nothing more so he left the scene found a telephone kiosk and called in bernie was cautious we dont know whats happening he said there seems to be a lull everywhere but we need to find out what the fascists are up to can you get back to the tower lloyd certainly could not fight his way through the massed police but perhaps there was another way i could try going via st george street he said doubtfully do the best you can i want to know their next move lloyd worked his way south through a maze of alleys he hoped he was right about st george street it was outside the contested area but the crowds might have spilled over however as he had hoped there were no crowds here even though he was still within earshot of the counterdemonstration and could hear shouting and police whistles a few women stood in the street talking and a gaggle of little girls skipped a rope in the middle of the road lloyd headed west breaking into a jogtrot expecting to see crowds of demonstrators or police around every bend he came across a few people who had strayed from the fracas two men with bandaged heads a woman in a ripped coat a bemedalled veteran with his arm in a sling but no crowds he ran all the way to where the street ended at the tower he was able to walk unhindered into tower gardens the fascists were still here that in itself was an achievement lloyd felt it was now half past three the marchers had been kept waiting here not marching for hours he saw that their high spirits had evaporated they were no longer singing or chanting but stood quiet and listless lined up but not so neatly their banners drooping their bands silent they already looked beaten however there was a change a few minutes later an open car emerged from a side street and drove alongside the fascist lines cheers went up the lines straightened the officers saluted the fascists stood to attention in the back seat of the car sat their leader sir oswald mosley a handsome man with a moustache wearing the uniform complete with cap rigidly straightbacked he saluted repeatedly as his car went by at walking pace as if he were a monarch inspecting his troops his presence reinvigorated his forces and worried lloyd this probably meant that they were going to march as planned otherwise why was he here the car followed the fascist line along a side street into the financial district lloyd waited half an hour later mosley returned this time on foot again saluting and acknowledging cheers when he reached the head of the line he turned and accompanied by one of his officers entered a side street lloyd followed mosley approached a group of older men standing in a huddle on the pavement lloyd was surprised to recognize sir philip game the commissioner of police in a bow tie and trilby hat the two men began an intense conversation sir philip must surely be telling sir oswald that the crowd of counterdemonstrators was too huge to be dispersed but what then would be his advice to the fascists lloyd longed to get close enough to eavesdrop but he decided not to risk arrest and remained at a discreet distance the police commissioner did most of the talking the fascist leader nodded briskly several times and asked a few questions then the two men shook hands and mosley walked away he returned to the park and conferred with his officers among them lloyd recognized boy fitzherbert wearing the same uniform as mosley boy did not look so well in it the trim military outfit did not suit his soft body and the lazy sensuality of his stance mosley seemed to be giving orders the other men saluted and moved away no doubt to carry out his commands what had he told them to do their only sensible option was to give up and go home but if they had been sensible they would not have been fascists whistles blew orders were shouted bands began to play and the men stood to attention they were going to march lloyd realized the police must have assigned them a route but what route then the march began and they went in the opposite direction instead of heading into the east end they went west into the financial district which was deserted on a sunday afternoon lloyd could hardly believe it theyve given up he said aloud and a man standing near him said looks like it dont it he watched for five minutes as the columns slowly moved off when there was absolutely no doubt what was happening he ran to a phone box and called bernie theyre marching away he said what into the east end no the other way theyre going west into the city weve won good god bernie spoke to the other people with him everybody the fascists are marching west theyve given up lloyd heard a burst of wild cheering in the room after a minute bernie said keep an eye on them let us know when theyve all left tower gardens absolutely lloyd hung up he walked around the perimeter of the park in high spirits it became clearer every minute that the fascists were defeated their bands played and they marched in time but there was no spring in their step and they no longer chanted that they were going to get rid of the yids the yids had got rid of them as he passed the end of byward street he saw daisy again she was heading towards the distinctive blackandcream rollsroyce and she had to walk past lloyd he could not resist the temptation to gloat the people of the east end have rejected you and your filthy ideas he said she stopped and looked at him cool as ever weve been obstructed by a gang of thugs she said with disdain still youre marching in the other direction now one battle doesnt make a war that might be true lloyd thought but it was a pretty big battle youre not marching home with your boyfriend i prefer to drive she said and hes not my boyfriend lloyds heart leaped in hope then she said hes my husband lloyd stared at her he had never really believed that she would be so stupid he was speechless its true she said reading the disbelief in his face didnt you see our engagement reported in the newspapers i dont read the society pages she showed him her left hand with a diamond engagement ring and a gold wedding band we were married yesterday we postponed our honeymoon to join the march today tomorrow were flying to deauville in boys plane she walked the few steps to the car and the chauffeur opened the door home please she said yes my lady lloyd was so angry he wanted to hit someone daisy looked back over her shoulder goodbye mr williams he found his voice goodbye miss peshkov oh no she said im viscountess aberowen now she just loved saying it lloyd could tell she was a titled lady and it meant the world to her she got into the car and the chauffeur closed the door lloyd turned away he was ashamed to realize that he had tears in his eyes hell he said aloud he sniffed swallowing tears he squared his shoulders and headed back towards the east end at a brisk walk todays triumph had been soured he knew he was a fool to care about daisy clearly she did not care about him but all the same it broke his heart that she was throwing herself away on boy fitzherbert he tried to put her out of his mind the police were getting back into their buses and leaving the scene lloyd had not been surprised by their brutality he had lived in the east end all his life and it was a rough neighbourhood but their antisemitism had shocked him they had called every woman a jewish whore every man a jew bastard in germany the police had supported the nazis and sided with the brownshirts would they do the same here surely not the crowd at gardiners corner had begun to rejoice the jewish lads brigade band was playing a jazz tune for men and women to dance to and bottles of whisky and gin were passed from hand to hand lloyd decided to go to the london hospital and check on millie then he should probably go to the jewish council headquarters and break the news to bernie that millie had been hurt before he got any further he ran into lenny griffiths we sent the buggers packing lenny said excitedly we did too lloyd grinned lenny lowered his voice we beat the fascists here and were going to beat them in spain too when are you leaving tomorrow me and dave are catching a train to paris in the morning lloyd put his arm around lennys shoulders ill come with you he said volodya peshkov bent his head against the driving snow as he walked across the bridge over the moscow river he wore a heavy greatcoat a fur hat and a stout pair of leather boots few muscovites were so well dressed volodya was lucky he always had good boots his father grigori was an army commander grigori was not a highflyer although he was a hero of the bolshevik revolution and a personal acquaintance of stalin his career had stalled at some point in the twenties all the same the family had always lived comfortably volodya himself was a highflyer after university he had got into the prestigious military intelligence academy a year later he had been posted to red army intelligence headquarters his greatest piece of luck had been meeting werner franck in berlin while his father had been a military attaché at the soviet embassy there werner had been at the same school in a more junior class learning that young werner hated fascism volodya had suggested to him that he could best oppose the nazis by spying for the russians werner had been only fourteen years old then but he was now eighteen he worked at the air ministry he hated the nazis even more and he had a powerful radio transmitter and a code book he was resourceful and courageous taking dreadful risks and gathering priceless information and volodya was his contact volodya had not seen werner for four years but he remembered him vividly tall with striking redblond hair werner looked and acted older than he was and even at fourteen he had been enviably successful with women werner had recently tipped him off about markus a diplomat at the german embassy in moscow who was secretly a communist volodya had sought markus out and recruited him as a spy for some months now markus had been supplying a stream of reports which volodya translated into russian and passed to his boss the latest was a fascinating account of how pronazi american business leaders were supplying the rightwing spanish rebels with trucks tyres and oil texacos chairman the hitleradmiring torkild rieber was using the companys tankers to smuggle oil to the rebels in defiance of a specific request from president roosevelt volodya was on his way to meet markus now he walked along kutuzovsky prospekt and turned towards the kiev station their rendezvous today was a workingmens bar near the station they never used the same place twice but finished each meeting by arranging the next one volodya was meticulous about tradecraft they always used cheap bars or cafés where markuss diplomatic colleagues would never dream of going if somehow markus were to fall under suspicion and be followed by a german counterespionage agent volodya would know for such a man would stand out from the other customers this place was called the ukraine bar like most buildings in moscow it was a timber structure the windows were steamed up so at least it would be warm inside but volodya did not go in immediately there were further precautions to be taken he crossed the street and ducked into the entrance of an apartment house he stood in the cold hallway looking out through a small window watching the bar he wondered if markus would show up he always had in the past but volodya could not feel sure if he did show up what information would he bring spain was the hot issue in international politics but red army intelligence was also passionately interested in german armaments how many tanks were they producing per month how many mauser m machine guns per day how good was the new heinkel he bomber volodya longed for such information to pass to his boss major lemitov half an hour went by and markus did not come volodya began to worry had markus been found out he worked as assistant to the ambassador and therefore saw everything that crossed the ambassadors desk but volodya had been urging him to seek access to other documents especially the correspondence of military attachés had that been a mistake had someone noticed markus sneaking a peek at cables that were none of his business then markus came along the street a professorial figure in spectacles and an austrianstyle loden coat white snowflakes spotting the green felt cloth he turned into the ukraine bar volodya waited watching another man followed markus in and volodya frowned anxiously but the second man was obviously a russian worker not a german counterespionage agent he was a small ratfaced man in a threadbare coat his boots wrapped in rags and he wiped the wet end of his pointed nose with his sleeve volodya crossed the street and went into the bar it was a smoky place none too clean and it smelled of men who did not often bathe on the walls were fading watercolours of ukrainian scenery in cheap frames it was midafternoon and there were not many customers the only woman in the place looked like an aging prostitute recovering from a hangover markus was at the back of the room hunched over an untasted glass of beer he was in his thirties but looked older with a neat fair beard and moustache he had thrown open his coat revealing a fur lining the ratfaced russian sat two tables away rolling a cigarette as volodya approached markus stood up and punched him in the mouth you cowfucker he screamed in german you pigs cunt volodya was so shocked that for a moment he did nothing his lips hurt and he tasted blood reflexively he raised his arm to hit back but he restrained himself markus swung at him again but this time volodya was ready and he easily dodged the wild blow why did you do it markus yelled why then just as suddenly he crumpled falling back into his chair burying his face in his hands and beginning to sob volodya spoke through bleeding lips shut up you fool he said he turned around and spoke to the other customers who were all staring its nothing hes upset they all looked away and one man left muscovites never voluntarily got involved in trouble it was dangerous even to separate two scrapping drunks in case one of them was powerful in the party and they knew that volodya was such a man they could tell by his good coat volodya turned back to markus in a lowered voice he said angrily what the hell was that for he spoke german markuss russian was poor you arrested irina the man replied weeping you fucking bastard you burned her nipples with a cigarette volodya winced irina was markuss russian girlfriend volodya began to see what this might be about and he had a bad feeling he sat down opposite markus i didnt arrest irina he said and im sorry if shes been hurt just tell me what happened they came for her in the middle of the night her mother told me they wouldnt say who they were but they werent regular police detectives they had better clothes she doesnt know where they took her they questioned her about me and accused her of being a spy they tortured her and raped her then they threw her out fuck said volodya im really sorry youre sorry it must have been you that did it who else this is nothing to do with army intelligence i swear makes no difference markus said im finished with you and im finished with communism there are sometimes casualties in the war against capitalism it sounded glib even to volodya as he said it you young fool markus said savagely dont you understand that socialism means freedom from this kind of shit volodya glanced up and saw a burly man in a leather coat come through the door he was not here for a drink volodya knew instinctively something was going on and volodya did not know what it was he was new to this game and right now he felt his lack of experience like a missing limb he thought he might be in danger but he did not know what to do the newcomer approached the table where volodya sat with markus then the ratfaced man stood up he was about the same age as volodya surprisingly he spoke with an educated accent you two are under arrest volodya cursed markus jumped to his feet i am commercial attaché at german embassy he screamed in ungrammatical russian you cannot arrest i have diplomatic immunity the other customers left the bar in a rush shoving at each other as they squeezed through the door only two people remained the bartender nervously swiping the counter with a filthy rag and the prostitute smoking a cigarette and staring into an empty vodka glass you cant arrest me either volodya said calmly he took his identification card from his pocket im lieutenant peshkov army intelligence who the fuck are you dvorkin nkvd the man in the leather coat said berezovsky nkvd the secret police volodya groaned he might have known the nkvd overlapped with army intelligence he had been warned that the two organizations were always treading on each others toes but this was his first experience of it he said to dvorkin i suppose it was you who tortured this mans girlfriend dvorkin wiped his nose on his sleeve apparently that unpleasant habit was not part of his disguise she had no information so you burned her nipples for nothing lucky for her if she had been a spy it would have been worse it didnt occur to you to check with us first when did you ever check with us markus said im leaving volodya felt desperate he was about to lose a valuable asset dont go he pleaded well make this up to irina somehow well get her the best hospital treatment fuck you said markus youll never see me again he walked out of the bar dvorkin evidently did not know what to do he did not want to let markus go but clearly he could not arrest him without looking foolish in the end he said to volodya you shouldnt let people speak to you that way it makes you look weak they should respect you you prick volodya said cant you see what youve done that man was a good source of reliable intelligence but now hell never work for us again thanks to your blundering dvorkin shrugged as you said to him sometimes there are casualties god spare me volodya said and he went out he felt vaguely nauseated as he walked back across the river he was sickened by what the nkvd had done to an innocent woman and downcast by the loss of his source he boarded a tram he was too junior to have a car he brooded as the vehicle trundled through the snow to his place of work he had to report to major lemitov but he hesitated wondering how to tell the story he needed to make it clear that he was not to blame yet avoid seeming to make excuses army intelligence headquarters stood on one edge of the khodynka airfield where a patient snowplough crawled up and down keeping the runway clear the architecture was peculiar a twostorey building with no windows in its outer walls surrounded a courtyard in which stood the ninestorey head office sticking up like a pointed finger out of a brick fist cigarette lighters and fountain pens could not be brought in as they might set off the metal detectors at the entrance so the army provided its staff with one of each inside belt buckles were a problem too so most people wore suspenders the security was superfluous of course muscovites would do anything to stay out of such a building no one was mad enough to want to sneak inside volodya shared an office with three other subalterns their steel desks side by side on opposite walls there was so little space that volodyas desk prevented the door from opening fully the office wit kamen looked at his swollen lips and said let me guess her husband came home early dont ask said volodya on his desk was a decrypt from the radio section the german words pencilled letter by letter under the code groups the message was from werner volodyas first reaction was fear had markus already reported what had happened to irina and persuaded werner too to withdraw from espionage today seemed a sufficiently unlucky day for such a disaster but the message was the opposite of disastrous volodya read with growing amazement werner explained that the german military had decided to send spies to spain posing as antifascist volunteers wanting to fight for the government side in the civil war they would report clandestinely from behind the lines to germanmanned listening stations in the rebel camp that in itself was redhot information but there was more werner had the names volodya had to restrain himself from whooping with joy a coup like this could happen only once in the lifetime of an intelligence man he thought it more than made up for losing markus werner was solid gold volodya dreaded to think what risks he must have taken to purloin this list of names and smuggle it out of air ministry headquarters in berlin he was tempted to run upstairs to lemitovs office right away but he restrained himself the four subalterns shared a typewriter volodya lifted the heavy old machine off kamens desk and put it on his own using the forefinger of each hand he typed out a russian translation of the message from werner while he was doing so the daylight faded and powerful security lights came on outside the building leaving a carbon copy in his desk drawer he took the top copy and went upstairs lemitov was in a goodlooking man of about forty he had dark hair slicked down with brilliantine he was shrewd and had a knack of thinking one step ahead of volodya who strove to emulate his forethought he did not subscribe to the orthodox military view that army organization was about shouting and bullying yet he was merciless with incompetent people volodya respected him and feared him this might be tremendously useful information lemitov said when he had read the translation might be volodya did not see any reason for doubt it could be disinformation lemitov pointed out volodya did not want to believe that but he realized with a surge of disappointment that he had to acknowledge the possibility that werner had been caught and turned into a double agent what kind of disinformation he asked dispiritedly are these false names to send us on a wild goose chase perhaps or they might be the real names of genuine volunteers communists and socialists who have escaped from nazi germany and gone to spain to fight for freedom we could end up arresting real antifascists hell lemitov smiled dont look so miserable the information is still very good we have our own spies in spain young russian soldiers and officers who have volunteered to join the international brigades they can investigate he picked up a red pencil and wrote on the sheet of paper in small neat handwriting well done he said volodya took that for dismissal and went to the door lemitov said did you meet markus today volodya turned back there was a problem i guessed by your mouth volodya told the story so i lost a good source he finished but i dont know what i could have done differently should i have told the nkvd about markus and warned them off fuck no said lemitov theyre completely untrustworthy never tell them anything but dont worry you havent lost markus you can get him back easily how volodya said uncomprehendingly he hates us all now arrest irina again what volodya was horrified had she not suffered enough then hell hate us even more tell him that if he doesnt continue to cooperate with us well interrogate her all over again volodya desperately tried to hide his revulsion it was important not to appear squeamish and he could see that lemitovs plan would work yes he managed to say only this time lemitov went on tell him well put the lighted cigarettes up her cunt volodya felt as if he might vomit he swallowed hard and said good idea ill pick her up now tomorrow is soon enough said lemitov four in the morning maximum shock yes sir volodya went out and closed the door behind him he stood in the corridor for a moment feeling unsteady then a passing clerk looked strangely at him and he forced himself to walk away he was going to have to do this he would not torture irina of course the threat would be enough but she would surely think she was going to be tortured all over again and that would terrify her out of her wits volodya felt that in her place he might go insane he had never imagined when he joined the red army that he might have to do such things of course the army was about killing people he knew that but torturing girls the building was emptying lights were being switched off in offices men with hats on were in the corridors it was time to go home returning to his office volodya called the military police and arranged to meet a squad at threethirty in the morning to arrest irina then he put on his coat and went to catch a tram home volodya lived with his parents grigori and katerina and his sister anya nineteen who was still at university on the tram he wondered if he could talk to his father about this he imagined saying do we have to torture people in communist society but he knew what the answer would be it was a temporary necessity essential to defend the revolution against spies and subversives in the pay of the capitalist imperialists perhaps he could ask how long will it be before we can abandon such dreadful practices of course his father would not know nor would anyone else on their return from berlin the peshkov family had moved into government house sometimes called the house on the embankment an apartment block across the river from the kremlin occupied by members of the soviet elite it was a huge building in the constructivist style with more than five hundred flats volodya nodded at the military policeman at the door then passed through the grand lobby so large that some evenings there was dancing to a jazz band and went up in the elevator the apartment was luxurious by soviet standards with constant hot water and a phone but it was not as pleasant as their home in berlin his mother was in the kitchen katerina was an indifferent cook and an unenthusiastic housekeeper but volodyas father adored her back in in st petersburg he had rescued her from the unwelcome attentions of a bullying policeman and he had been in love with her ever since she was still attractive at fortythree volodya guessed and while the family had been on the diplomatic circuit she had learned how to dress more stylishly than most russian women though she was careful not to look western a serious offence in moscow did you hurt your mouth she said to him after he kissed her hello its nothing volodya smelled chicken special dinner anya is bringing a boyfriend home ah a fellow student i dont think so im not sure what he does volodya was pleased he was fond of his sister but he knew she was not beautiful she was short and stumpy and wore dull clothes in drab colours she had not had many boyfriends and it was good news that one liked her enough to come home with her he went to his room took off his jacket and washed his face and hands his lips were almost back to normal markus had not hit him very hard while he was drying his hands he heard voices and gathered that anya and her boyfriend had arrived he put on a knitted cardigan for comfort and left his room he went into the kitchen anya was sitting at the table with a small ratfaced man volodya recognized oh no volodya said you it was ilya dvorkin the nkvd agent who had arrested irina his disguise had gone and he was dressed in a normal dark suit and decent boots he stared at volodya in surprise of course peshkov he said i didnt make the connection volodya turned to his sister dont tell me this is your boyfriend anya said in dismay whats the matter volodya said we met earlier today he screwed up an important army operation by sticking his nose in where it didnt belong i was doing my job said dvorkin he wiped the end of his nose on his sleeve some job katerina stepped in to rescue the situation dont bring your work home she said volodya please pour a glass of vodka for our guest volodya said really his mothers eyes flashed anger really okay reluctantly he took the bottle from the shelf anya got glasses from a cupboard and volodya poured katerina took a glass and said now lets start again ilya this is my son vladimir whom we always call volodya volodya this is anyas friend ilya who has come to dinner why dont you shake hands volodya had no option but to shake the mans hand katerina put snacks on the table smoked fish pickled cucumber sliced sausage in summer we have salad that i grow at the dacha but at this time of year of course there is nothing she said apologetically volodya realized that she was keen to impress ilya did his mother really want anya to marry this creep he supposed she must grigori came in wearing his army uniform all smiles sniffing the chicken and rubbing his hands together at fortyeight he was redfaced and corpulent it was hard to imagine him storming the winter palace as he had in he must have been thinner then he kissed his wife with relish volodya thought his mother was thankful for his fathers unabashed lust without actually returning it she would smile when he patted her bottom hug him when he embraced her and kiss him as often as he wanted but she was never the initiator she liked him respected him and seemed happy being married to him but clearly she did not burn with desire volodya would want more than that from marriage the matter was purely hypothetical volodya had had a dozen or so shortterm girlfriends but had not yet met a woman he wanted to marry volodya poured his father a shot of vodka and grigori tossed it back with relish then took some smoked fish so ilya what work do you do im with the nkvd ilya said proudly ah a very good organization to belong to grigori did not really think this volodya suspected he was just trying to be friendly volodya thought the family should be unfriendly in the hope that they could drive ilya away he said i suppose father that when the rest of the world follows the soviet union in adopting the communist system there will no longer be a need for the secret police and the nkvd can then be abolished grigori chose to treat the question lightly no police at all he said jovially no criminal trials no prisons no counterespionage department as there will be no spies no army either since we will have no enemies what will we all do for a living he laughed heartily this however may still be some distance in the future ilya looked suspicious as if he felt something subversive was being said but he could not put his finger on it katerina brought to the table a plate of black bread and five bowls of hot borscht and they all began to eat when i was a boy in the countryside grigori said all winter long my mother would save vegetable peelings apple cores the discarded outer leaves of cabbages the hairy part of the onion anything like that in a big old barrel outside the house where it all froze then in the spring when the snow melted she would use it to make borscht thats what borscht really is you know soup made from peelings you youngsters have no idea how well off you are there was a knock at the door grigori frowned not expecting anyone but katerina said oh i forgot konstantins daughter is coming grigori said you mean zoya vorotsyntsev the daughter of magda the midwife i remember zoya said volodya skinny kid with blonde ringlets shes not a kid any more katerina said shes twentyfour and a scientist she stood up to go to the door grigori frowned we havent seen her since her mother died why has she suddenly made contact she wants to talk to you katerina replied to me about what physics katerina went out grigori said proudly her father konstantin and i were delegates to the petrograd soviet in we issued the famous order number one his face darkened he died sadly after the civil war volodya said he must have been young what did he die of grigori glanced at ilya and quickly looked away pneumonia he said and volodya knew he was lying katerina returned followed by a woman who took volodyas breath away she was a classic russian beauty tall and slim with lightblonde hair blue eyes so pale they were almost colourless and perfect white skin she wore a simple nilegreen dress whose plainness only drew attention to her slender figure she was introduced all around then she sat at the table and accepted a bowl of borscht grigori said so zoya youre a scientist im a graduate student doing my doctorate and i teach undergraduate classes she said volodya here works in red army intelligence grigori said proudly how interesting she said obviously meaning the opposite volodya realized that grigori saw zoya as a potential daughterinlaw he hoped his father would not hint at this too heavily he had already made up his mind to ask her for a date before the end of the evening but he could manage that by himself he did not need his fathers help on the contrary unsubtle parental boasting might put her off how is the soup katerina asked zoya delicious thank you volodya was already getting the impression of a matteroffact personality behind the gorgeous exterior it was an intriguing combination a beautiful woman who made no attempt to charm anya cleared away the soup bowls while katerina brought the main course chicken and potatoes cooked in a pot zoya tucked in stuffing the food into her mouth chewing and swallowing and eating more like most russians she did not often see food this good volodya said what kind of science do you do zoya with evident regret she stopped eating to answer im a physicist she said were trying to understand the atom what its components are what holds them together is that interesting completely fascinating she put down her fork were finding out what the universe is really made of theres nothing so exciting her eyes lit up apparently physics was the one thing that could distract her from her dinner ilya spoke up for the first time ah but how does all this theoretical stuff help the revolution zoyas eyes blazed anger and volodya liked her even more some comrades make the mistake of undervaluing pure science preferring practical research she said but technical developments such as improved aircraft are ultimately based on theoretical advances volodya concealed a grin ilya had been demolished with one casual swipe but zoya had not finished this is why i wanted to talk to you sir she said to grigori we physicists read all the scientific journals published in the west they foolishly reveal their results to the whole world and lately we have realized that they are making alarming forward leaps in their understanding of atomic physics soviet science is in grave danger of falling behind i wonder if comrade stalin is aware of this the room went quiet the merest hint of a criticism of stalin was dangerous he knows most things grigori said of course zoya said automatically but perhaps there are times when loyal comrades such as yourself need to draw important matters to his attention yes thats true ilya said undoubtedly comrade stalin believes that science should be consistent with marxistleninist ideology volodya saw a flash of defiance in zoyas eyes but she dropped her gaze and said humbly there can be no question that he is right we scientists must clearly redouble our efforts this was horseshit and everyone in the room knew it but no one would say so the proprieties had to be observed indeed said grigori nevertheless i will mention it next time i get a chance to talk to the comrade general secretary of the party he may wish to look into it further i hope so said zoya we want to be ahead of the west and how about after work zoya said grigori cheerily do you have a boyfriend a fiancé perhaps anya protested dad thats none of our business zoya did not seem to mind no fiancé she said mildly no boyfriend as bad as my son volodya he too is single he is twentythree years old well educated tall and handsome yet he has no fiancée volodya squirmed at the heavyhandedness of this hint hard to believe zoya said and as she glanced at volodya he saw a gleam of humour in her eyes katerina put a hand on her husbands arm enough she said stop embarrassing the poor girl the doorbell rang again said grigori this time i have no idea who it might be said katerina as she left the kitchen she returned with volodyas boss major lemitov startled volodya jumped to his feet good evening sir he said this is my father grigori peshkov dad may i present major lemitov lemitov saluted smartly grigori said at ease lemitov sit down and have some chicken has my son done something wrong that was precisely the thought that was making volodyas hands shake no sir rather the contrary but i was hoping for a private word with you and him volodya relaxed a little perhaps he was not in trouble after all well weve just about finished dinner grigori said standing up lets go into my study lemitov looked at ilya arent you with the nkvd he said and proud of it dvorkin is the name oh you tried to arrest volodya this afternoon i thought he was behaving like a spy i was right wasnt i you must learn to arrest enemy spies not our own lemitov went out volodya grinned that was the second time dvorkin had been put down volodya grigori and lemitov crossed the hallway the study was a small room sparsely furnished grigori took the only easy chair lemitov sat at a small table volodya closed the door and remained standing lemitov said to volodya does your comrade father know about this afternoons message from berlin no sir youd better tell him volodya related the story of the spies in spain his father was delighted well done he said of course this might be disinformation but i doubt it the nazis arent that imaginative however we are we can arrest the spies and use their radios to send misleading messages to the rightwing rebels volodya had not thought of that dad might play the fool with zoya he thought but he still has a sharp mind for intelligence work exactly said lemitov grigori said to volodya your school friend werner is a brave man he turned back to lemitov how do you plan to handle this well need some good intelligence men in spain to investigate these germans it shouldnt be too difficult if they really are spies there will be evidence code books wireless sets and so on he hesitated ive come here to suggest we send your son volodya was astonished he had not seen that coming grigoris face fell ah he said thoughtfully i must confess the prospect fills me with dismay we would miss him so much then a look of resignation came over his face as if he realized he did not really have a choice the defence of the revolution must come first of course an intelligence man needs field experience lemitov said you and i have seen action sir but the younger generation have never been on the battlefield true true how soon would he go in three days time volodya could see that his father was trying desperately to think of a reason to keep him at home but finding none volodya himself was excited spain he thought of bloodred wine blackhaired girls with strong brown legs and hot sunshine instead of moscow snow it would be dangerous of course but he had not joined the army to be safe grigori said well volodya what do you think volodya knew his father wanted him to come up with an objection the only drawback he could think of was that he would not have time to get to know the stunning zoya it is a wonderful opportunity he said im honoured to have been chosen very well said his father there is one small problem lemitov said it has been decided that army intelligence will investigate but not actually carry out the arrests that will be the prerogative of the nkvd his smile was humourless im afraid you will be working with your friend dvorkin ii it was amazing lloyd williams thought how quickly you could come to love a place he had been in spain for only ten months but already his passion for the country was almost as strong as his attachment to wales he loved to see a rare flower blooming in the scorched landscape he enjoyed sleeping in the afternoon he liked the way there was wine to drink even when there was nothing to eat he had experienced flavours he had never tasted before olives paprika chorizo and the fiery spirit they called orujo he stood on a rise staring across a heathazed landscape with a map in his hand there were a few meadows beside a river and some trees on distant mountainsides but in between was a barren featureless desert of dusty soil and rock not much cover for our advance he said anxiously beside him lenny griffiths said its going to be a bloody hard battle lloyd looked at his map saragossa straddled the ebro river about a hundred miles from its mediterranean end the town dominated communications in the aragon region it was a major crossroads a rail junction and the meeting of three rivers here the spanish army confronted the antidemocratic rebels across an arid nomansland some people called the government forces republicans and the rebels nationalists but these were misleading names many people on both sides were republicans in that they did not want to be ruled by a king and they were all nationalist in that they loved their country and were willing to die for it lloyd thought of them as the government and the rebels right now saragossa was held by francos rebels and lloyd was looking towards the town from a vantage point fifty miles south still if we can take the town the enemy will be bottled up in the north for another winter he said if said lenny it was a grim prognosis lloyd thought gloomily when the best he could wish for was that the rebel advance might be halted but no victory was in sight this year for the government all the same a part of lloyd was looking forward to the fight he had been in spain for ten months and this would be his first taste of action until now he had been an instructor in a base camp as soon as the spaniards had discovered that he had been in britains officer training corps they had sped him through his induction made him a lieutenant and put him in charge of new arrivals he had to drill them until obeying orders became a reflex march them until their feet stopped bleeding and their blisters turned to calluses and show them how to strip down and clean what few rifles were available but the flood of volunteers had now slowed to a trickle and the instructors had been moved to fighting battalions lloyd wore a beret a zipped blouson with his badge of rank roughly handsewn to the sleeve and corduroy breeches he carried a short spanish mauser rifle firing mm ammunition that had presumably been stolen from some civil guard arsenal lloyd lenny and dave had been split up for a while but the three had been reunited in the british battalion of the th international brigade for the coming battle lenny now had a black beard and looked a decade older than his seventeen years he had been made a sergeant though he had no uniform just blue dungarees and a striped bandana he looked more like a pirate than a soldier now lenny said anyway this attack has nothing to do with bottling up the rebels its political this region has always been dominated by the anarchists lloyd had seen anarchism in action during a brief spell in barcelona it was a cheerfully fundamentalist form of communism officers and men got the same pay the dining rooms of the grand hotels had been turned into canteens for the workers waiters would hand back a tip explaining amiably that the practice of tipping was demeaning posters everywhere condemned prostitution as exploitation of female comrades there had been a wonderful atmosphere of liberation and camaraderie the russians hated it lenny went on now the government has brought communist troops from the madrid area and amalgamated us all into the new army of the east under overall communist command of course this kind of talk made lloyd despair the only way to win was for all the leftwing factions to work together as they had in the end at least at the battle of cable street but anarchists and communists had been fighting each other in the streets of barcelona he said prime minister negrín isnt a communist he might as well be he understands that without the support of the soviet union were finished but does that mean we abandon democracy and let the communists take over lloyd nodded every discussion about the government ended the same way do we have to do everything the soviets want just because they are the only people who will sell us guns they walked down the hill lenny said well have a nice cup of tea now is it yes please two lumps of sugar in mine it was a standing joke neither of them had had tea for months they came to their camp by the river lennys platoon had taken over a little cluster of crude stone buildings that had probably been cowsheds until the war drove the farmers away a few yards upriver a boathouse had been occupied by some germans from the th international brigade lloyd and lenny were met by lloyds cousin dave williams like lenny dave had aged ten years in one he looked thin and hard his skin tanned and dusty his eyes wrinkled with squinting into the sun he wore the khaki tunic and trousers leather belt pouches and anklebuckled boots that formed the standardissue uniform though few soldiers had a complete set he had a red cotton scarf around his neck he carried a russian mosinnagant rifle with the oldfashioned spike bayonet reversed making the weapon less clumsy at his belt he had a german mm luger that he must have taken from the corpse of a rebel officer apparently he was very accurate with rifle or pistol weve got a visitor he said excitedly who is he she said dave and pointed in the shade of a misshapen black poplar tree a dozen british and german soldiers were talking to a startlingly beautiful woman oh duw said lenny using the welsh word for god shes a sight for sore eyes she looked about twentyfive lloyd thought and she was petite with big eyes and a mass of black hair pinned up and topped by a foreandaft army cap somehow her baggy uniform seemed to cling to her like an evening gown a volunteer called heinz who knew that lloyd understood german spoke to him in that language this is teresa sir she has come to teach us to read lloyd nodded understanding the international brigades consisted of foreign volunteers mixed with spanish soldiers and literacy was a problem with the spanish they had spent their childhood chanting the catechism in village schools run by the catholic church many priests did not teach the children to read for fear that in later life they would get hold of socialist books as a result only about half the population had been literate under the monarchy the republican government elected in had improved education but there remained millions of spaniards who could not read or write and classes for soldiers continued even in the front line im illiterate said dave who was not me too said joe eli who taught spanish literature at columbia university in new york teresa spoke in spanish her voice was low and calm and very sexy how many times do you think i have heard this joke she said but she did not seem very cross lenny moved closer im sergeant griffiths he said ill do anything i can to help you of course his words were practical but his tone of voice made them sound like an amorous invitation she gave him a dazzling smile that would be most helpful she said lloyd spoke formally to her in his best spanish im so very glad youre here señorita he had spent much of the last ten months studying the language i am lieutenant williams i can tell you exactly which members of the group require lessons and which do not lenny said dismissively but the lieutenant has to go to bujaraloz to get our orders bujaraloz was the small town where government forces had set up headquarters perhaps you and i should look around here for a suitable place to hold classes he might have been suggesting a walk in the moonlight lloyd smiled and nodded agreement he was happy to let lenny romance teresa he himself was in no mood for flirting whereas lenny seemed in love already in lloyds opinion lennys chances were close to zero teresa was an educated twentyfiveyearold who probably got a dozen propositions a day and lenny was a seventeenyearold coal miner who had not taken a bath for a month but he said nothing teresa seemed capable of looking after herself a new figure appeared a man of lloyds age who looked vaguely familiar he was dressed better than the soldiers in wool breeches and a cotton shirt and had a handgun in a buttoned holster his hair was cut so short that it looked like stubble a style favoured by russians he was only a lieutenant but had an air of authority even power he said in fluent german i am looking for lieutenant garcia hes not here said lloyd in the same language where have you and i met before the russian seemed shocked and irritated at the same time like one who finds a snake in his bedroll we have never met he said firmly you are mistaken lloyd snapped his fingers berlin he said nineteen thirtythree we were attacked by brownshirts a look of relief came briefly over the mans face as if he had been expecting something worse yes i was there he said my name is vladimir peshkov but we called you volodya yes at that scrap in berlin you were with a boy called werner franck volodya looked panicked for a moment then hid his feelings with an effort i know no one of that name lloyd decided not to press the point he could guess why volodya was jumpy the russians were as terrified as everyone else of their secret police the nkvd who were operating in spain and had a reputation for brutality to them any russian who was friendly with foreigners might be a traitor im lloyd williams i do remember volodya looked at him with a penetrating blueeyed stare how strange that we should meet again here not so strange really lloyd said we fight the fascists wherever we can can i have a quiet word of course they walked a few yards away from the others peshkov said there is a spy in garcias platoon lloyd was astonished a spy who a german called heinz bauer why thats him in the red shirt a spy are you sure peshkov did not bother to answer that question id like you to summon him to your dugout if you have one or some other private place peshkov looked at his wristwatch in one hour an arrest unit will be here to pick him up im using that little shed as my office said lloyd pointing but i need to speak to my commanding officer about this the co was a communist and unlikely to interfere but lloyd wanted time to think if you wish volodya clearly did not care what lloyds commanding officer thought i want the spy taken quietly without any fuss i have explained to the arrest unit the importance of discretion he sounded as if he was not sure his wishes would be obeyed the fewer people who know the better why said lloyd but before volodya could reply he figured out the answer for himself youre hoping to turn him into a double agent sending misleading reports to the enemy but if too many people know he has been caught then other spies may warn the rebels and they will not believe the disinformation it is better not to speculate about such matters peshkov said severely now let us go to your shed wait a minute said lloyd how do you know he is a spy i cant tell you without compromising security thats a bit unsatisfactory peshkov looked exasperated clearly he was not used to being told that his explanations were unsatisfactory discussion of orders was a feature of the spanish civil war that the russians particularly detested before peshkov could say anything further two more men appeared and approached the group under the tree one of the newcomers wore a leather jacket despite the heat the other who seemed to be in charge was a scrawny man with a long nose and a receding chin peshkov let out an exclamation of anger too early he said then he called out something indignant in russian the scrawny man made a dismissive gesture in rough spanish he said which one is heinz bauer no one answered the scrawny man wiped the end of his nose with his sleeve then heinz moved he did not immediately flee but cannoned into the man in the leather jacket knocking him down then he dashed away but the scrawny man stuck out a leg and tripped him up heinz fell hard his body skidding on the dry soil he lay stunned only for a moment but it was a moment too long as he got to his knees the two men pounced on him and knocked him down again he lay still but all the same they started to beat him up they drew wooden clubs standing either side of him they took turns to hit his head and body raising their arms above their heads and striking down in a vicious ballet in a few seconds there was blood all over heinzs face he tried desperately to escape but when he got to his knees they pushed him down again then he curled up in a ball whimpering he was clearly finished but they were not they clubbed the helpless man again and again lloyd found himself shouting a protest and pulling the scrawny man off lenny did the same to the other one lloyd grabbed his man in a bear hug and lifted him lenny knocked his man to the ground then lloyd heard volodya say in english stand still or ill shoot lloyd let go of his man and turned incredulous volodya had drawn his sidearm a standardissue russian nagant m revolver and cocked it threatening an officer with a weapon is a courtmartial offence in every army in the world lloyd said youre in deep trouble volodya dont be a fool said volodya when was the last time a russian was in trouble in this army but he lowered the gun the man in the leather jacket raised his club as if to hit lenny but volodya barked back off berezovsky and the man obeyed other soldiers appeared drawn by the mysterious magnetism that attracts men to a fight and in seconds there were twenty of them the scrawny man pointed a finger at lloyd speaking english with a heavy accent he said you have interfered in matters that do not concern you lloyd helped heinz to his feet he was groaning in pain and covered in blood you people cant just march in and start beating people up lloyd said to the scrawny man wheres your authority this german is a trotskyfascist spy the man screeched volodya said shut up ilya ilya took no notice he has been photographing documents he said where is your evidence lloyd said calmly ilya clearly did not know or care about the evidence but volodya sighed and said look in his kitbag lloyd nodded to mario rivera a corporal go and check he said corporal rivera ran to the boathouse and disappeared inside but lloyd had a dreadful feeling volodya was telling the truth he said even if youre right ilya you could use a little courtesy ilya said courtesy this is a war not an english tea party it might save you from getting into unnecessary fights ilya said something contemptuous in russian rivera emerged from the building carrying a small expensivelooking camera and a sheaf of official papers he showed them to lloyd the top document was yesterdays general order for deployment of troops ahead of the coming assault the paper bore a wine stain of familiar shape and lloyd realized with a shock that it was his own copy and must have been purloined from his shed he looked at heinz who straightened gave the fascist salute and said heil hitler ilya looked triumphant volodya said well ilya you have now ruined the prisoners value as a double agent another coup for the nkvd congratulations and he walked off iii lloyd went into battle for the first time on tuesday august his side the elected government had men the antidemocratic rebels had fewer than half that the government also had two hundred aircraft against the rebels fifteen to make the most of this superiority the government advanced over a wide front a northsouth line sixty miles long so that the rebels could not concentrate their limited numbers it was a good plan so why lloyd asked himself two days later was it not working it had started well enough on the first day the government had taken two villages north of saragossa and two to the south lloyds group in the south had overcome fierce resistance to take a village called codo the only failure was the central push up the river valley which had stalled at a place called fuentes de ebro before the battle lloyd had been scared and he spent the night awake imagining what was to come as he sometimes did before a boxing match but once the fighting started he was too busy to worry the worst moment was advancing across the barren scrubland with no cover but stunted bushes while the defenders fired from inside stone buildings even then what he had felt was not fear but a kind of desperate cunning zigzagging as he ran crawling and rolling when the bullets came too near then getting up and running bent double a few more yards the main problem was shortage of ammunition they had to make every shot count they took codo by force of numbers and lloyd lenny and dave ended the day unhurt the rebels were tough and brave but so were the government forces the foreign brigades were made up of idealistic volunteers who had come to spain knowing they might have to give their lives because of their reputation for courage they were often chosen to spearhead attacks the assault began to go wrong on the second day the northern forces had stayed put reluctant to advance because of lack of intelligence about rebel defences a feeble excuse lloyd thought the central group still could not take fuentes de ebro despite being reinforced on the third day and lloyd was appalled to hear that they had lost nearly all their tanks to devastating defensive fire in the south lloyds group instead of pushing forward was directed to make a sideways move to the riverside village of quinto once again they had to overcome determined defenders in housetohouse fighting when the enemy surrendered lloyds group took a thousand prisoners now lloyd sat in the evening light outside a church that had been wrecked by artillery fire surrounded by the smoking ruins of houses and the strangely still bodies of the recently dead a group of exhausted men gathered around him lenny dave joe eli corporal rivera and a welshman called muggsy morgan there were so many welshmen in spain that someone had made up a limerick poking fun at the similarity in their names there was a young fellow named price and another young fellow named price and a fellow named roberts and a fellow named roberts and another young fellow named price the men were smoking waiting quietly to see whether there would be any dinner too weary even to banter with teresa who was remarkably still with them as the transport due to take her to the rear had failed to appear they could hear occasional bursts of shooting as moppingup continued a few streets away what have we gained lloyd said to dave we used scarce ammunition we lost a lot of men and were no farther forward worse weve given the fascists time to bring up reinforcements i can tell you the fucking reason dave said in his east end accent his soul had hardened even more than his body and he had become cynical and contemptuous our officers are more afraid of their commissars than of the fucking enemy at the least excuse they can be branded as trotskyfascist spies and tortured to death so theyre terrified of sticking their necks out theyd rather sit still than move they wont do anything on their own initiative and they never take risks i bet they dont shit without an order in writing lloyd wondered whether daves scornful analysis was right the communists never ceased to talk about the need for a disciplined army with a clear chain of command by that they meant an army following russian orders but all the same lloyd saw their point however too much discipline could stifle thinking was that what was going wrong lloyd did not want to believe it surely social democrats communists and anarchists could fight in a common cause without one group tyrannizing the others they all hated fascism and they all believed in a future society that was fairer to everyone he wondered what lenny thought but lenny was sitting next to teresa talking to her in a low voice she giggled at something he said and lloyd guessed that he must be making progress it was a good sign when you could make a girl laugh then she touched his arm said a few words and stood up lenny said hurry back she smiled over her shoulder lucky lenny thought lloyd but he felt no envy a passing romance held no appeal for him he did not see the point he was an allornothing man he supposed the only girl he had ever really wanted had been daisy she was now boy fitzherberts wife and lloyd still had not met the girl who might take her place in his heart he would one day he felt sure but meanwhile he was not much attracted to temporary substitutes even when they were as alluring as teresa someone said here come the russians the speaker was jasper johnson a black american electrician from chicago lloyd looked up to see a dozen or so military advisors walking through the village like conquerors the russians were recognizable by their leather jackets and buttoned holsters strange thing i didnt see them while we were fighting jasper went on sarcastically i guess they must have been in a different part of the battlefield lloyd looked around making sure that no political commissars were nearby to hear this subversive talk as the russians passed through the graveyard of the ruined church lloyd spotted ilya dvorkin the weaselly secret policeman he had clashed with a week ago the russian crossed paths with teresa and stopped to speak to her lloyd heard him say something in bad spanish about dinner she replied he spoke again and she shook her head evidently refusing she turned to walk away but he took hold of her arm detaining her lloyd saw lenny sit upright looking alertly at the tableau the two figures framed by a stone archway that no longer led anywhere oh shit said lloyd teresa tried again to move away and ilya seemed to tighten his grip lenny moved to get up but lloyd put a hand on his shoulder and pushed him down let me deal with this he said dave murmured a low warning careful mate hes in the nkvd best not to mess with those fucking bastards lloyd walked over to teresa and ilya the russian saw him and said in spanish get lost lloyd said hello teresa she said i can handle this dont worry ilya looked more closely at lloyd i know you he said you tried to prevent the arrest of a dangerous trotskyfascist spy last week lloyd said and is this young lady also a dangerous trotskyfascist spy i thought i just heard you ask her to have dinner with you ilyas sidekick berezovsky appeared and stood aggressively close to lloyd out of the corner of his eye lloyd saw dave draw the luger from his belt this was getting out of control lloyd said i came to tell you señorita that colonel bobrov wants to see you in his headquarters immediately please follow me and ill take you to him bobrov was a senior russian military advisor he had not invited teresa but it was a plausible story and ilya did not know it was a lie for a frozen moment lloyd could not tell which way it was going to go then the bang of a nearby gunshot was heard perhaps from the next street it seemed to return the russians to reality teresa again moved away from ilya and this time he let her go ilya pointed a finger aggressively at lloyds face ill see you again he said and he made a dramatic exit followed doglike by berezovsky dave said stupid prick ilya pretended not to hear they all sat down dave said youve made a bad enemy lloyd i didnt have much choice all the same watch your back from now on an argument about a girl lloyd said dismissively happens a thousand times a day as darkness fell a handbell summoned them to a field kitchen lloyd got a bowl of thin stew a slab of dry bread and a big cup of red wine so harshtasting that he imagined it taking the enamel off his teeth he dipped his bread in the wine improving both when the food was gone he was still hungry as usual he said well have a nice cup of tea shall we aye said lenny two lumps of sugar please they unrolled their thin blankets and prepared to sleep lloyd went in search of a latrine found none and relieved himself in a small orchard on the edge of the village there was a threequarter moon and he could see the dusty leaves on olive trees that had survived the shelling as he buttoned up he heard a footstep he turned around slowly too slowly by the time he saw ilyas face the club was coming down on his head he felt an agonizing pain and fell to the ground dazed he looked up berezovsky held a shortbarrelled revolver pointed at his head beside him ilya said dont move or youll be dead lloyd was terrified desperately he shook his head to clear it this was insane dead he said incredulously and how will you explain the murder of a lieutenant murder said ilya he smiled this is the front line a stray bullet got you he switched to english jolly bad luck lloyd realized with despair that ilya was right when his body was found it would look as if he had been killed in the battle what a way to die ilya said to berezovsky finish him off there was a bang lloyd felt nothing was this death then berezovsky crumpled and fell to the ground at the same moment lloyd realized that the shot had come from behind him he turned incredulous to look in the moonlight he saw dave holding his stolen luger relief swamped him like a tidal wave he was alive ilya too had seen dave and he ran like a startled rabbit dave tracked him with the pistol for several seconds and lloyd willed him to shoot but ilya dodged frantically between the olive trees like a rat in a maze then disappeared into the darkness dave lowered the gun lloyd looked down at berezovsky he was not breathing lloyd said thanks dave i told you to watch your back you watched it for me but its a pity you didnt get ilya too now youre in trouble with the nkvd i wonder said dave will ilya want people to know that he got his sidekick killed in a squabble over a woman even the nkvd people are frightened of the nkvd i think hell keep it quiet lloyd looked again at the body how do we explain this you heard the man dave said this is the front line no explanation needed lloyd nodded dave and ilya were both right no one would ask how berezovsky had died a stray bullet got him they walked away leaving the body where it lay jolly bad luck said dave iv lloyd and lenny spoke to colonel bobrov and complained that the attack on saragossa was stalemated bobrov was an older russian with a cropped fuzz of white hair nearing retirement and rigidly orthodox in theory he was there only to help and advise the spanish commanders in practice the russians called the shots were wasting time and energy on these little villages lloyd said translating into german what lenny and all the experienced men were saying tanks are supposed to be armoured fists used for deep penetration striking far into enemy territory the infantry should follow mopping up and securing after the enemy has been scattered volodya was standing nearby listening and seemed by his expression to agree though he said nothing small strongpoints like this wretched onehorse town should not be allowed to delay the advance but should be bypassed and dealt with later by a second line lloyd finished bobrov looked shocked this is the theory of the discredited marshal tuchachevsky he said in hushed tones it was as if lloyd had told a bishop to pray to buddha so what said lloyd he has confessed to treason and espionage and has been executed lloyd stared incredulously are you telling me that the spanish government cannot use modern tank tactics because some general has been purged in moscow lieutenant williams you are becoming disrespectful lloyd said even if the charges against tuchachevsky are true that doesnt mean his methods are wrong that will do bobrov thundered this conversation is over any hope that lloyd might have had remaining was crushed when his battalion was moved from quinto back in the direction they had come another sideways manoeuvre on september they were part of the attack on belchite a welldefended but strategically worthless small town twentyfive miles wide of their objective it was another hard battle some seven thousand defenders were well dug in at the towns largest church san agustin and atop a nearby hill with trenches and earthworks lloyd and his platoon reached the outskirts of town without casualties but then came under withering fire from windows and rooftops six days later they were still there the corpses were stinking in the heat as well as humans there were dead animals for the towns water supply had been cut off and livestock were dying of thirst whenever they could the engineers stacked the bodies up doused them with gasoline and set fire to them but the smell of roasting humans was worse than the stink of corruption it seemed hard to breathe and some of the men wore their gas masks the narrow streets around the church were killing fields but lloyd had devised a way to make progress without going outside lenny had found some tools in a workshop now two men were making a hole in the wall of the house in which they were sheltering joe eli was using a pickaxe sweat gleaming on his bald head corporal rivera who wore a striped shirt in the anarchist colours of red and black wielded a sledgehammer the wall was made of flat yellow local bricks roughly mortared lenny directed the operation to make sure that they did not bring the entire house down as a miner he had an instinct for the trustworthiness of a roof when the hole was big enough for a man to pass through lenny nodded to jasper also a corporal jasper took one of his few remaining grenades from his belt pouch drew the pin and threw it into the next house just in case there was an ambush as soon as it had exploded lloyd crawled quickly through the hole rifle at the ready he found himself in another poor spanish home with whitewashed walls and a floor of beaten earth there was no one here dead or alive the thirtyfive men of his platoon followed him through the hole and ran through the place to flush out any defenders the house was small and empty in this way they were moving slowly but safely through a row of cottages towards the church they started work on the next hole but before they broke through they were halted by a major called marquez who came along the row of houses by the route they had made through the walls forget all that he said in spanishaccented english were going to rush the church lloyd went cold it was suicidal he said is that colonel bobrovs idea yes said major marquez noncommittally wait for the signal three sharp blows on the whistle can we get more ammunition lloyd said were low especially for this kind of action no time said the major and he went away lloyd was horrified he had learned a lot in a few days of battle and he knew that the only way to rush a welldefended position was under a hail of covering fire otherwise the defenders would just mow the attackers down the men looked mutinous and corporal rivera said it is impossible lloyd was responsible for maintaining their morale no complaints you lot he said breezily youre all volunteers did you think war wasnt dangerous if it was safe your sisters could do it for you they laughed and the moment of danger passed for now he moved to the front of the house opened the door a crack and peeped out the sun glared down on a narrow street with houses and shops on both sides the buildings and the ground were the same pale tan colour like undercooked bread except where shelling had gouged up red earth right outside the door a militiaman lay dead a cloud of flies feasting on the hole in his chest looking towards the square lloyd saw that the street widened towards the church the gunmen in the high twin towers had a clear view and an easy shot at anyone approaching on the ground there was only minimal cover some rubble a dead horse a wheelbarrow were all going to die he thought but why else did we come here he turned back to his men wondering what to say he had to keep them thinking positively just hug the sides of the street close to the houses he said remember the slower you go the longer youre exposed so wait for the whistle then run like fuck sooner than expected he heard the three sharp chirrups of major marquezs whistle lenny youre last out he said whos first said lenny i am of course goodbye world lloyd thought at least ill die fighting fascists he threw the door wide lets go he yelled and he ran out surprise gave him a few seconds grace and he ran freely along the street towards the church he felt the scorch of the midday sun on his face and heard the pounding of his mens boots behind him and noted with a weird sentiment of gratitude that such sensations meant he was still alive then gunfire broke out like a hailstorm for a few more heartbeats he ran hearing the zip and thwack of bullets then there was a feeling in his left arm as if he had banged it against something and inexplicably he fell down he realized he had been hit there was no pain but his arm was numb and hung lifeless he managed to roll sideways until he hit the wall of the nearest building shots continued to fly and he was terribly vulnerable but a few feet ahead he saw a dead body it was a rebel soldier propped against the house he looked as if he had been sitting on the ground resting with his back against the wall and had gone to sleep except that there was a bullet wound in his neck lloyd wriggled forward moving awkwardly rifle in his right hand left arm dragging behind then crouched behind the body trying to make himself small he rested his rifle barrel on the dead mans shoulder and took aim at a high window in the church tower he fired all five rounds in his magazine in rapid succession he could not tell whether he had hit anyone he looked back to his horror he saw the street littered with the corpses of his platoon the still body of mario rivera in his red and black shirt looked like a crumpled anarchist flag next to mario was jasper johnson his black curls soaked in blood all the way from a factory in chicago lloyd thought to die on the street in a small town in spain because he believed in a better world worse were those who still lived moaning and crying on the ground somewhere a man was screaming in agony but lloyd could not see who or where a few of his men were still running but as he watched more fell and others threw themselves down seconds later no one was moving except the writhing wounded what a slaughter he thought and a bile of anger and sorrow rose chokingly in his throat where were the other units surely lloyds platoon was not the only one involved in the attack perhaps others were advancing along parallel streets leading to the square but a rush required overwhelming numbers lloyd and his thirtyfive were obviously too few the defenders had been able to kill and wound nearly all of them and the few who remained of lloyds platoon had been forced to take cover before reaching the church he caught the eye of lenny peering from behind the dead horse at least he was still alive lenny held up his rifle and made a helpless gesture pantomiming no ammunition lloyd was out too in the next minute firing from the street died away as the others also ran out of bullets that was the end of the attack on the church it had been impossible anyway with no ammunition it would have been pointless suicide the hail of fire from the church had lessened as the easier targets were eliminated but sporadic sniping continued at those remaining behind cover lloyd realized that all his men would be killed eventually they had to withdraw they would probably all be killed in the retreat he caught lennys eye again and waved emphatically towards the rear away from the church lenny looked around repeating the gesture to the few others left alive they would have a better chance if they all moved at the same time when as many as possible had been forewarned lloyd struggled to his feet retreat he yelled at the top of his voice then he began to run it was no more than two hundred yards but it was the longest journey of his life the rebels in the church opened fire as soon as they saw the government troops move out of the corner of his eye lloyd thought he saw five or six of his men retreating he ran with a ragged gait his wounded arm putting him off balance lenny was ahead of him apparently unhurt bullets scored the masonry of the buildings that lloyd staggered past lenny made it to the house they had come from dashed in and held the door open lloyd ran in panting hoarsely and collapsed on the floor three more followed them in lloyd stared at the survivors lenny dave muggsy morgan and joe eli is that all he said lenny said yes jesus five of us left out of thirtysix what a great military advisor colonel bobrov is they stood panting catching their breath the feeling returned to lloyds arm and it hurt like hell he found he could move it painfully so perhaps it was not broken looking down he saw that his sleeve was soaked with blood dave took off his red scarf and improvised a sling lenny had a head wound there was blood on his face but he said it was a scratch and he seemed all right dave muggsy and joe were miraculously unhurt wed better go back for fresh orders lloyd said when they had lain down a few minutes we cant accomplish anything without ammunition anyway lets have a nice cup of tea first is it said lenny lloyd said we cant we havent got teaspoons oh all right then dave said cant we rest here a bit longer well rest in the rear lloyd said its safer they made their way back along the row of houses using the holes they had made in the walls the repeated bending made lloyd dizzy he wondered if he was weak from loss of blood they emerged out of sight of the church of san agustin and hurried along a side street lloyds relief at still being alive was rapidly giving way to a feeling of rage at the waste of the lives of his men they came to the barn on the outskirts where the government forces had made their headquarters lloyd saw major marquez behind a stack of crates giving out ammunition why couldnt we have had some of that he said furiously marquez just shrugged im reporting this to bobrov lloyd said colonel bobrov was outside the barn sitting on a chair at a table both of which items of furniture looked as if they had been taken from a village house his face was reddened with sunburn he was talking to volodya peshkov lloyd went straight up to them we rushed the church but we had no support he said and we ran out of ammunition because marquez refused to supply us bobrov looked coldly at lloyd what are you doing here he said lloyd was puzzled he expected bobrov to congratulate him for a brave effort and at least commiserate with him over the lack of support i just told you he said there was no support you cant rush a fortified building with one platoon we did our best but we were slaughtered ive lost thirtyone of my thirtysix men he pointed at his four companions this is all thats left of my platoon who ordered you to retreat lloyd was fighting off dizziness he felt close to collapse but he had to explain to bobrov how bravely his men had fought we came back for fresh orders what else could we do you should have fought to the last man what should we have fought with we had no bullets silence bobrov barked stand to attention automatically they all stood to attention lloyd lenny dave muggsy and joe in a line lloyd feared he was about to faint about face they turned their backs lloyd thought what now those who are wounded fall out lloyd and lenny stepped back bobrov said the walking wounded are transferred to prisoner escort duty dimly lloyd perceived that this meant he would probably be guarding prisoners of war on a train to barcelona he swayed on his feet right now i couldnt guard a flock of sheep he thought bobrov said retreating under fire without orders is desertion lloyd turned and looked at bobrov to his astonishment and horror he saw that bobrov had drawn his revolver from its buttoned holster bobrov stepped forward so that he was immediately behind the three men standing to attention you three are found guilty and sentenced to death he raised the gun until the barrel was three inches from the back of daves head then he fired there was a bang a bullet hole appeared in daves head and blood and brains exploded from his brow lloyd could not believe what he was seeing next to dave muggsy began to turn his mouth open to shout but bobrov was quicker he swung the gun to muggsys neck and fired again the bullet entered behind muggsys right ear and came out through his left eye and he crumpled at last lloyds voice came and he shouted no joe eli turned roaring with shock and rage and raised his hands to grab bobrov the gun banged again and joe got a bullet in the throat blood spurted like a fountain from his neck and splashed bobrovs red army uniform causing the colonel to curse and jump back a pace joe fell to the ground but did not die immediately lloyd watched helpless as the blood pumped out of joes carotid artery into the parched spanish earth joe seemed to try to speak but no words came and then his eyes closed and he went limp theres no mercy for cowards bobrov said and he walked away lloyd looked at dave on the ground thin grimy brave as a lion sixteen years old and dead killed not by the fascists but by a stupid and brutal soviet officer what a waste lloyd thought and tears came to his eyes a sergeant came running out of the barn theyve given up he shouted joyfully the town hall has surrendered theyve raised the white flag weve taken belchite the dizziness overwhelmed lloyd at last and he fainted v london was cold and wet lloyd walked along nutley street in the rain heading for his mothers house he still wore his zipped spanish army blouson and corduroy breeches and boots with no socks he carried a small backpack containing his spare underwear a shirt and a tin cup around his neck he had the red scarf dave had turned into an improvised sling for his wounded arm the arm still hurt but he no longer needed the sling it was late on an october afternoon as expected he had been put on a supply train returning to barcelona crammed with rebel prisoners the journey was not much more than a hundred miles but it had taken three days in barcelona he had been separated from lenny and lost contact with him he had got a lift in a lorry going north after the trucker dropped him off he had walked hitchhiked and ridden in railway wagons full of coal or gravel or on one lucky occasion cases of wine he had slipped across the border into france at night he had slept rough begged food done odd jobs for a few coins and for two glorious weeks earned his crosschannel boat fare picking grapes in a bordeaux vineyard now he was home he inhaled the damp sootsmelling aldgate air as if it were perfume he stopped at the garden gate and looked up at the terraced house in which he had been born more than twentytwo years ago lights glowed behind the rainstreaked windows someone was at home he walked up to the front door he still had his key he had kept it with his passport he let himself in he dropped his backpack on the floor in the hall by the hatstand from the kitchen he heard whos that it was the voice of his stepfather bernie lloyd found he could not speak bernie came into the hall who then he recognized lloyd my life he said its you lloyd said hello dad my boy said bernie he put his arms around lloyd alive bernie said lloyd could feel him shaking with sobs after a minute bernie rubbed his eyes with the sleeve of his cardigan then went to the bottom of the stairs eth he called what someone to see you just a minute she came down the stairs a few seconds later pretty as ever in a blue dress halfway down she saw his face and turned pale oh duw she said its lloyd she came down the rest of the stairs in a rush and threw her arms around him youre alive she said i wrote to you from barcelona we never got that letter then you dont know what dave williams died oh no killed at the battle of belchite lloyd had decided not to tell the truth about how dave had died what about lenny griffiths i dont know i lost touch with him i was hoping he might have got home before me no theres no word bernie said what was it like over there the fascists are winning and its mainly the fault of the communists who are more interested in attacking the other left parties bernie was shocked surely not its true if ive learned one thing in spain its that we have to fight the communists just as hard as the fascists theyre both evil his mother smiled wryly well just fancy that she had figured out the same thing long ago lloyd realized enough politics he said how are you mam oh im the same but look at you youre so thin not much to eat in spain id better make you something no rush ive been hungry for twelve months i can keep going a few more minutes i tell you what would be nice though what anything id love a nice cup of tea thomas macke was watching the soviet embassy in berlin when volodya peshkov came out the prussian secret police had been transformed into the new more efficient gestapo six years ago but commissar macke was still in charge of the section that monitored traitors and subversives in the city of berlin the most dangerous of them were undoubtedly getting their orders from this building at unter den linden so macke and his men watched everyone who went in and came out the embassy was an art deco fortress made of a white stone that painfully reflected the glare of the august sun a pillared lantern stood watchful above the central block and to either side the wings had rows of tall narrow windows like guardsmen at attention macke sat at a pavement café opposite berlins most elegant boulevard was busy with cars and bicycles the women shopped in their summer dresses and hats the men walked briskly by in suits or smart uniforms it was hard to believe there were still german communists how could anyone possibly be against the nazis germany was transformed hitler had wiped out unemployment something no other european leader had achieved strikes and demonstrations were a distant memory of the bad old days the police had nononsense powers to stamp out crime the country was prospering many families had a radio and soon they would have peoples cars to drive on the new autobahns and that was not all germany was strong again the military was well armed and powerful in the last two years both austria and czechoslovakia had been absorbed into greater germany which was now the dominant power in europe mussolinis italy was allied with germany in the pact of steel earlier this year madrid had at last fallen to francos rebels and spain now had a fascistfriendly government how could any german wish to undo all that and bring the country under the heel of the bolsheviks in mackes eyes such people were scum vermin filth that had to be ruthlessly sought out and utterly destroyed as he thought about them his face twisted into a scowl of anger and he tapped his foot on the pavement as if preparing to stomp a communist then he saw peshkov he was a young man in a blue serge suit carrying a light coat over his arm as if expecting a change in the weather his closecropped hair and quick march indicated the army despite his civilian clothes and the way he scanned the street deceptively casual but thorough suggested either red army intelligence or the nkvd the russian secret police mackes pulse quickened he and his men knew everyone at the embassy by sight of course their passport photographs were on file and the team watched them all the time but he did not know much about peshkov the man was young twentyfive according to his file macke recalled so he might be a junior staffer of no importance or he could be good at seeming unimportant peshkov crossed unter den linden and walked towards where macke sat near the corner of friedrich strasse as peshkov came closer macke noted that the russian was quite tall with the build of an athlete he had an alert look and an intense gaze macke looked away suddenly nervous he picked up his cup and sipped the cold dregs of his coffee partly covering his face he did not want to meet those blue eyes peshkov turned into friedrich strasse macke nodded to reinhold wagner standing on the opposite corner and wagner followed peshkov macke then got up from his table and followed wagner not everyone in red army intelligence was a cloakanddagger spy of course they got most of their information legitimately mainly by reading the german newspapers they did not necessarily believe everything they read but they took note of clues such as an advertisement by a gun factory needing to recruit ten skilled lathe operators furthermore russians were free to travel germany and look around unlike diplomats in the soviet union who were not allowed to leave moscow unescorted the young man whom macke and wagner were now tailing might be the tame newspaperreading kind of intelligence gatherer all that was required for such a job was fluent german and the ability to summarize they followed peshkov past mackes brothers restaurant it was still called bistro robert but it had a different clientele gone were the wealthy homosexuals the jewish businessmen with their mistresses and the overpaid actresses calling for pink champagne such people kept their heads down nowadays if they were not already in concentration camps some had left germany and good riddance macke thought even if it did unfortunately mean that the restaurant no longer made much money he wondered idly what had become of the former owner robert von ulrich he vaguely remembered that the man had gone to england perhaps he had opened a restaurant for perverts there peshkov went into a bar wagner followed him in a minute or two later while macke watched the outside it was a popular place while macke waited for peshkov to reappear he saw a soldier and a girl enter and a couple of welldressed women and an old man in a grubby coat come out and walk away then wagner came out alone looked directly at macke and spread his arms in a gesture of bewilderment macke crossed the street wagner was distressed hes not there did you look everywhere yes including the toilets and the kitchen did you ask if anyone had gone out the back way they said not wagner was scared with reason this was the new germany and errors were no longer dealt with by a slap on the wrist he could be severely punished but not this time thats all right said macke wagner could not hide his relief is it weve learned something important macke said the fact that he shook us off so expertly tells us that hes a spy and a very good one ii volodya entered the friedrich strasse station and boarded a ubahn train he took off the cap glasses and dirty raincoat that had helped him look like an old man he sat down took out a handkerchief and wiped away the powder he had put on his shoes to make them appear shabby he had been unsure about the raincoat it was such a sunny day that he feared the gestapo might have noticed it and realized what he was up to but they had not been that clever and no one had followed him from the bar after he had done his quick change in the mens room he was about to do something highly dangerous if they caught him contacting a german dissident the best that he could expect was to be deported back to moscow with his career in ruins if he were less lucky he and the dissident would both vanish into the basement of gestapo headquarters in prinz albrecht strasse never to be seen again the soviets would complain that one of their diplomats had disappeared and the german police would pretend to do a missingpersons search then regretfully report no success volodya had never been to gestapo headquarters of course but he knew what it would be like the nkvd had a similar facility in the soviet trade mission at lietsenburger strasse steel doors an interrogation room with tiled walls so that the blood could be washed off easily a tub for cutting up the bodies and an electrical furnace for burning the parts volodya had been sent to berlin to expand the network of soviet spies here fascism was triumphant in europe and germany was more of a threat to the ussr now than ever stalin had fired his foreign minister litvinov and replaced him with vyacheslav molotov but what could molotov do the fascists seemed unstoppable the kremlin was haunted by the humiliating memory of the great war in which the germans had defeated a russian army of six million men stalin had taken steps to form a pact with france and britain to restrain germany but the three powers had been unable to agree and the talks had broken down in the last few days sooner or later war was expected between germany and the soviet union and it was volodyas job to gather military intelligence that would help the soviets win that war he got off the train in the poor workingclass district of wedding north of berlins centre outside the station he stood and waited watching the other passengers as they left pretending to study a timetable pasted on the wall he did not move off until he was quite sure no one had followed him here then he made his way to the cheap restaurant that was his chosen rendezvous as was his regular practice he did not go in but stood at a bus stop on the other side of the road and watched the entrance he was confident he had shaken off any tail but now he needed to make sure werner had not been followed he was not sure that he would recognize werner franck who had been a fourteenyearold boy when volodya had last seen him and was now twenty werner felt the same so they had agreed they would both carry todays edition of the berliner morgenpost open to the sports page volodya read a preview of the new soccer season as he waited glancing up every few seconds to look for werner ever since being a schoolboy in berlin volodya had followed the citys top team hertha he had often chanted ha ho he hertha bsc he was interested in the teams prospects but anxiety spoiled his concentration and he read the same report over and over again without taking anything in his two years in spain had not boosted his career in the way he had hoped rather the reverse volodya had uncovered numerous nazi spies like heinz bauer among the german volunteers but then the nkvd had used that as an excuse to arrest genuine volunteers who had merely expressed mild disagreement with the communist line hundreds of idealistic young men had been tortured and killed in the nkvds prisons at times it had seemed as if the communists were more interested in fighting their anarchist allies than their fascist enemies and all for nothing stalins policy was a catastrophic failure the upshot was a rightwing dictatorship the worst imaginable outcome for the soviet union but the blame was put on those russians who had been in spain even though they had faithfully carried out kremlin instructions some of them had disappeared soon after returning to moscow volodya had gone home in fear after the fall of madrid he had found many changes in and stalin had purged the red army thousands of commanders had disappeared including many of the residents of government house where his parents lived but previously neglected men such as grigori peshkov had been promoted to take the places of those purged and grigoris career had a new impetus he was in charge of the defence of moscow against air raids and was frantically busy his enhanced status was probably the reason why volodya was not among those scapegoated for the failure of stalins spanish policy the unpleasant ilya dvorkin had also somehow avoided punishment he was back in moscow and married to volodyas sister anya much to volodyas regret there was no accounting for womens choices in such matters she was already pregnant and volodya could not repress a nightmare image of her nursing a baby with the head of a rat after a brief leave volodya had been posted to berlin where he had to prove his worth all over again he looked up from his paper to see werner walking along the street werner had not changed much he was a little taller and broader but he had the same strawberryblond hair falling over his forehead in a way girls had found irresistible the same look of tolerant amusement in his blue eyes he wore an elegant lightblue summer suit and gold links glinted at his cuffs there was no one following him volodya crossed the road and intercepted him before he reached the café werner smiled broadly showing white teeth i wouldnt have recognized you with that army haircut he said its good to see you after all these years he had not lost any of his warmth and charm volodya noted lets go inside you dont really want to go into that dump do you werner said it will be full of plumbers eating sausages with mustard i want to get off the street here we could be seen by anyone passing theres an alley three doors down good they walked a short distance and turned into a narrow passage between a coal yard and a grocery store what have you been doing werner said fighting the fascists just like you volodya considered whether to tell him more i was in spain it was no secret where you had no more success than we did here in germany but its not over yet let me ask you something werner said leaning against the wall if you thought bolshevism was wicked would you be a spy working against the soviet union volodyas instinct was to say no absolutely not but before the words came out he realized how tactless that would be for the prospect that revolted him was precisely what werner was doing betraying his country for the sake of a higher cause i dont know he said i think it must be very difficult for you to work against germany even though you hate the nazis youre right werner said and what happens if war breaks out am i going to help you kill our soldiers and bomb our cities volodya was worried it seemed that werner was weakening its the only way to defeat the nazis he said you know that i do i made my decision a long time ago and the nazis have done nothing to change my mind its hard thats all i understand volodya said sympathetically werner said you asked me to suggest other people who might do for you what i am doing volodya nodded people like willi frunze remember him cleverest boy in school he was a serious socialist he chaired that meeting the brownshirts broke up werner shook his head he went to england volodyas heart sank why hes a brilliant physicist and hes studying in london shit but ive thought of someone else good did you ever know heinrich von kessel i dont think so was he at our school no he went to a catholic school and in those days he didnt share our politics either his father was a big shot in the centre party which put hitler in power in correct heinrich was then working for his father the father has now joined the nazis but the son is wracked by guilt how do you know he got drunk and told my sister frieda shes seventeen i think he fancies her this was promising volodyas spirits lifted is he a communist no what makes you think hell work for us i asked him straight out if you got a chance to fight against the nazis by spying for the soviet union would you do it he said he would whats his job hes in the army but he has a weak chest so they made him a penpusher which is lucky for us because now he works for the supreme high command in the economic planning and procurement department volodya was impressed such a man would know exactly how many trucks and tanks and machine guns and submarines the german military was acquiring month by month and where they were being deployed he began to feel excited when can i meet him now ive arranged to have a drink with him in the adlon hotel after work volodya groaned the adlon was berlins swankiest hotel it was located on unter den linden because it was in the government and diplomatic district the bar was a favourite haunt of journalists hoping to pick up gossip it would not have been volodyas choice of rendezvous but he could not afford to miss this chance all right he said but im not going to be seen talking to either of you in that place ill follow you in identify heinrich then follow him out and accost him later okay ill drive you there my cars around the corner as they walked to the other end of the alley werner told volodya heinrichs work and home addresses and phone numbers and volodya committed them to memory here we are said werner jump in the car was a mercedes k autobahn kurier a model that was headturningly beautiful with sensually curved fenders a bonnet longer than an entire ford model t and a sloping fastback rear end it was so expensive that only a handful had ever been sold volodya stared aghast shouldnt you have a less ostentatious car he said incredulously its a double bluff werner said they think no real spy would be so flamboyant volodya was going to ask how he could afford it but then he recalled that werners father was a wealthy manufacturer im not getting into that thing volodya said ill go by train as you wish ill see you at the adlon but dont acknowledge me of course half an hour later volodya saw werners car carelessly parked in front of the hotel this cavalier attitude of werners seemed foolish to him but now he wondered whether it was a necessary element of werners courage perhaps werner had to pretend to be carefree in order to take the appalling risks required to spy on the nazis if he acknowledged the danger he was in maybe he would not be able to carry on the bar of the adlon was full of fashionable women and welldressed men many in smartly tailored uniforms volodya spotted werner right away at a table with another man who was presumably heinrich von kessel passing close to them volodya heard heinrich say argumentatively buck clayton is a much better trumpeter than hot lips page he squeezed in at the counter ordered a beer and discreetly studied the new potential spy heinrich had pale skin and thick dark hair that was long by army standards although they were talking about the relatively unimportant topic of jazz he seemed very intense arguing with gestures and repeatedly running his fingers through his hair he had a book stuffed into the pocket of his uniform tunic and volodya would have bet it contained poetry volodya drank two beers slowly and pretended to read the morgenpost from cover to cover he tried not to get too keyed up about heinrich the man was thrillingly promising but there was no guarantee he would cooperate recruiting informers was the hardest part of volodyas work precautions were difficult to take because the target was not yet on side the proposition often had to be made in inappropriate places usually somewhere public it was impossible to know how the target would react he might be angry and shout his refusal or be terrified and literally run away but there was not much the recruiter could do to control the situation at some point he just had to ask the simple blunt question do you want to be a spy he thought about how to approach heinrich religion was probably the key to his personality volodya recalled his boss lemitov saying lapsed catholics make good agents they reject the total authority of the church only to accept the total authority of the party heinrich might need to seek forgiveness for what he had done but would he risk his life at last werner paid the bill and the two men left volodya followed outside the hotel they parted company werner driving off with a squeal of tyres and heinrich going on foot across the park volodya went after heinrich night was falling but the sky was clear and he could see well there were many people strolling in the warm evening air most of them in couples volodya looked back repeatedly to make sure no one had followed him or heinrich from the adlon when he was satisfied he took a deep breath steeled his nerve and caught up with heinrich walking alongside him volodya said there is atonement for sin heinrich looked at him warily as at someone who might be mad are you a priest you could strike back at the wicked regime you helped to create heinrich kept walking but he looked worried who are you what do you know about me volodya continued to ignore heinrichs questions the nazis will be defeated one day that day could come sooner with your help if youre a gestapo agent hoping to entrap me dont bother im a loyal german do you notice my accent yes you sound russian how many gestapo agents speak german with a russian accent or have the imagination to fake it heinrich laughed nervously i know nothing about gestapo agents he said i shouldnt have mentioned the subject very foolish of me your office produces reports of the quantities of armaments and other supplies ordered by the military copies of those reports could be immeasurably useful to the enemies of the nazis to the red army you mean who else is going to destroy this regime we keep careful track of all copies of such reports volodya suppressed a surge of triumph heinrich was thinking about practical difficulties that meant he was inclined to agree in principle make an extra carbon volodya said or write out a copy in longhand or take someones file copy there are ways of course there are and any of them could get me killed if we do nothing about the crimes that are being committed by this regime is life worth living heinrich stopped and stared at volodya volodya could not guess what the man was thinking but instinct told him to remain quiet after a long pause heinrich sighed and said ill think about it i have him volodya thought exultantly heinrich said how do i contact you you dont volodya said i will contact you he touched the brim of his hat then walked back the way he had come he felt exultant if heinrich had not meant to accept the proposition he would have rejected it firmly his promising to think about it was almost as good as acceptance he would sleep on it he would run over the dangers but he would do it eventually volodya felt almost certain he told himself not to be overconfident a hundred things could go wrong all the same he was full of hope as he left the park and walked in bright lights past the shops and restaurants of unter den linden he had had no dinner but he could not afford to eat on this street he took a tram eastwards into the lowrent neighbourhood called friedrichshain and made his way to a small apartment in a tenement the door was opened by a short pretty girl of eighteen with fair hair she wore a pink sweater and dark slacks and her feet were bare although she was slim she had delightfully generous breasts im sorry to call unexpectedly volodya said is it inconvenient she smiled not at all she said come in he stepped inside she closed the door then threw her arms around him im always happy to see you she said and kissed him eagerly lili markgraf was a girl with a lot of affection to give volodya had been taking her out about once a week since he got back to berlin he was not in love with her and he knew that she dated other men including werner but when they were together she was passionate after a moment she said have you heard the news is that why youve come what news lili worked as a secretary in a press agency and always heard things first the soviet union has made a pact with germany she said that made no sense you mean with britain and france against germany no i dont thats the surprise stalin and hitler have made friends but volodya tailed off baffled friends with hitler it seemed crazy was this the solution devised by the new soviet foreign minister molotov we have failed to stop the tide of world fascism so we give up trying did my father fight a revolution for that iii woody dewar saw joanne rouzrokh again after four years no one who knew her father actually believed he had tried to rape a starlet in the ritzcarlton hotel the girl had dropped the charges but that was dull news and the papers had given it little prominence consequently dave was still a rapist in the eyes of buffalo people so joannes parents moved to palm beach and woody lost touch next time he saw her it was in the white house woody was with his father senator gus dewar and they were going to see the president woody had met franklin d roosevelt several times his father and the president had been friends for many years but those had been social occasions when fdr had shaken woodys hand and asked him how he was getting along at school this would be the first time woody attended a real political meeting with the president they went in through the main entrance of the west wing passed through the entrance lobby and stepped into a large waiting room and there she was woody stared at her in delight she had hardly changed with her narrow haughty face and curved nose she still looked like the high priestess of an ancient religion as ever she wore simple clothes to dramatic effect today she had on a darkblue suit of some cool fabric and a straw hat the same colour with a big brim woody was glad he had put on a clean white shirt and his new striped tie this morning she seemed pleased to see him you look great she said are you working in dc now just helping out in my fathers office for the summer he replied im still at harvard she turned to his father and said deferentially good afternoon senator hello joanne woody was thrilled to run into her she was as alluring as ever he wanted to keep the conversation going what are you doing here woody said i work at the state department woody nodded that explained her deference to his father she had joined a world in which people kowtowed to senator dewar woody said whats your job im assistant to an assistant my boss is with the president now but im too lowly to go in with him you were always interested in politics i recall an argument about lynching i miss buffalo what fun we used to have woody remembered kissing her at the racquet club ball and he felt himself blush his father said please give my best regards to your father indicating that they needed to move on woody considered asking for her phone number but she preempted him id love to see you again woody she said he was delighted sure are you free tonight im having a few friends for cocktails sounds great she gave him the address an apartment building not far away then his father hurried him out of the other end of the room a guard nodded familiarly to gus and they stepped into another waiting room gus said now woody dont say anything unless the president addresses you directly woody tried to concentrate on the imminent meeting there had been a political earthquake in europe the soviet union had signed a peace pact with nazi germany upsetting everyones calculations woodys father was a key member of the senate foreign relations committee and the president wanted to know what he thought gus dewar had another subject to discuss he wanted to persuade roosevelt to revive the league of nations it would be a tough sell the usa had never joined the league and americans did not much like it the league had failed dismally to deal with the crises of the s japanese aggression in the far east italian imperialism in africa nazi takeovers in europe the ruin of democracy in spain but gus was determined to try it had always been his dream woody knew a world council to resolve conflicts and prevent war woody was per cent behind him he had made a speech about this in a harvard debate when two nations had a quarrel the worst possible procedure was for men to kill people on the other side that seemed to him pretty obvious i understand why it happens of course he had said in the debate just like i understand why drunks get into fistfights but that doesnt make it any less irrational but now woody found it hard to think about the threat of war in europe all his old feelings about joanne came back in a rush he wondered if she would kiss him again maybe tonight she had always liked him and it seemed she still did why else would she have invited him to her party she had refused to date him back in because he had been fifteen and she eighteen which was understandable though he had not thought so at the time but now that they were both four years older the age difference would not seem so stark would it he hoped not he had dated girls in buffalo and at harvard but he had not felt for any of them the overwhelming passion he had had for joanne have you got that his father said woody felt foolish his father was about to make a proposal to the president that could bring world peace and all woody could think about was kissing joanne sure he said i wont say anything unless he speaks to me first a tall slim woman in her early forties came into the room looking relaxed and confident as if she owned the place and woody recognized marguerite lehand nicknamed missy who managed roosevelts office she had a long masculine face with a big nose and there was a touch of grey in her dark hair she smiled warmly at gus what a pleasure to see you again senator how are you missy you remember my son woodrow i do the president is ready for you both missys devotion to roosevelt was famous fdr was more fond of her than a married man was entitled to be according to washington gossip woody knew from guarded but revealing remarks his parents made to one another that roosevelts wife eleanor had refused to sleep with him since she gave birth to their sixth child the paralysis that had struck him five years later did not extend to his sexual equipment perhaps a man who had not slept with his wife for twenty years was entitled to an affectionate secretary she showed them through another door and across a narrow corridor then they were in the oval office the president sat at a desk with his back to three tall windows in a curving bay the blinds were drawn to filter the august sun coming through the southfacing glass roosevelt used an ordinary office chair woody saw not his wheelchair he wore a white suit and he was smoking a cigarette in a holder he was not really handsome he had receding hair and a jutting chin and he wore pincenez glasses that made his eyes seem too close together all the same there was something immediately attractive about his engaging smile his hand extended to shake and the amiable tone of voice in which he said good to see you gus come on in mr president you remember my elder son woodrow of course hows harvard woody just fine sir thank you im on the debating team he knew that politicians often had the knack of seeming to know everyone intimately either they had remarkable memories or their secretaries reminded them efficiently i was at harvard myself sit down sit down roosevelt removed the end of his cigarette from the holder and stubbed it in a full ashtray gus what the heck is happening in europe the president knew what was happening in europe of course thought woody he had an entire state department to tell him but he wanted gus dewars analysis gus said germany and russia are still mortal enemies in my opinion thats what we all thought but then why have they signed this pact shortterm convenience for both stalin needs time he wants to build up the red army so they can defeat the germans if it comes to that and the other guy hitler is clearly on the point of doing something to poland the german press is full of ridiculous stories about how the poles are mistreating their germanspeaking population hitler doesnt stir up hatred without a purpose whatever hes planning he doesnt want the soviets to stand in his way hence the pact thats pretty much what hull says cordell hull was secretary of state but he doesnt know what will happen next will stalin let hitler do anything he wants my guess is theyll carve up poland between them in the next couple of weeks and then what a few hours ago the british signed a new treaty with the poles promising to come to their aid if poland is attacked but what can they do nothing sir the british army navy and air force have no power to prevent the germans overrunning poland what do you think we should do gus said the president woody knew that this was his fathers chance he had the presidents attention for a few minutes it was a rare opportunity to make something happen woody discreetly crossed his fingers gus leaned forward we dont want our sons to go to war as we did roosevelt had four boys in their twenties and thirties woody suddenly understood why he was here he had been brought to the meeting to remind the president of his own sons gus said quietly we cant send american boys to be slaughtered in europe again the world needs a police force what do you have in mind roosevelt said noncommittally the league of nations isnt such a failure as people think in the s it resolved a border dispute between finland and sweden and another between turkey and iraq gus was ticking items off on his fingers it stopped greece and yugoslavia from invading albania and persuaded greece to pull out of bulgaria and it sent a peacekeeping force to keep colombia and peru from hostilities all true but in the thirties the league was not strong enough to deal with fascist aggression its not surprising the league was crippled from the start because congress refused to ratify the covenant so the united states was never a member we need a new americanled version with teeth gus paused mr president its too soon to give up on a peaceful world woody held his breath roosevelt nodded but then he always nodded woody knew it was rare for him to disagree openly he hated confrontation you had to be careful woody had heard his father say not to take his silence for consent woody did not dare look at his father sitting beside him but he could sense the tension at last the president said i believe youre right woody had to restrain himself from whooping aloud the president had consented he looked at his father the normally imperturbable gus was barely concealing his surprise it had been such a quick victory gus moved rapidly to consolidate it in that case may i suggest that cordell hull and i draft a proposal for your consideration hull has a lot on his plate talk to welles sumner welles was undersecretary of state he was both ambitious and flamboyant and woody knew he would not have been guss first choice but he was a longtime friend of the roosevelt family he had been a pageboy at fdrs wedding anyway gus was not going to make difficulties at this point by all means he said anything else that was clearly dismissal gus stood up and woody followed suit gus said what about mrs roosevelt your mother sir last i heard she was in france her ship left yesterday thank goodness im glad to hear it thank you for coming in roosevelt said i really value your friendship gus gus said nothing could give me more pleasure sir he shook hands with the president and woody did the same then they left woody half hoped that joanne would still be hanging around but she had gone as they made their way out of the building gus said lets go for a celebratory drink woody looked at his watch it was five oclock sure he said they went to old ebbitts on f street near th stained glass green velvet brass lamps and hunting trophies the place was full of congressmen senators and the people who followed them around aides lobbyists and journalists gus ordered a dry martini straight up with a twist for himself and a beer for woody woody smiled maybe he would have liked a martini in fact he would not to him it just tasted like cold gin but it would have been nice to be asked however he raised his glass and said congratulations you got what you wanted what the world needs you argued brilliantly roosevelt hardly needed convincing hes a liberal but a pragmatist he knows you cant do everything you have to pick the battles you can win the new deal is his number one priority getting unemployed men back to work he wont do anything that interferes with the main mission if my plan becomes controversial enough to upset his supporters hell drop it so we havent won anything yet gus smiled weve taken the important first step but no we havent won anything a pity he forced welles on you not entirely sumner strengthens the project hes closer to the president than i am but hes unpredictable he might pick it up and run in a different direction woody looked across the room and saw a familiar face guess whos here i might have known his father looked in the same direction standing at the bar woody said with a couple of older guys in hats and a blonde girl its greg peshkov as usual greg looked a mess despite his expensive clothes his silk tie was awry his shirt was coming out of his waistband and there was a smear of cigarette ash on his icecreamcoloured trousers nevertheless the blonde was looking adoringly at him so it is said gus do you see much of him at harvard hes a physics major but he doesnt hang around with the scientists too dull for him i guess i run into him at the crimson the harvard crimson was the student newspaper woody took photographs for the paper and greg wrote articles hes doing an internship at the state department this summer thats why hes here in the press office i imagine said gus the two men hes with are reporters the one in the brown suit for the chicago tribune and the pipe smoker for the cleveland plain dealer woody saw that greg was talking to the journalists as if they were old friends taking the arm of one as he leaned forward to say something in a low voice patting the other on the back in mock congratulation they seemed to like him woody thought as they laughed loudly at something he said woody envied that talent it was useful to politicians though perhaps not essential his father did not have that hailfellowwellmet quality and he was one of the most senior statesmen in america woody said i wonder how his halfsister daisy feels about the threat of war shes over there in london she married some english lord to be exact she married the elder son of earl fitzherbert whom i used to know quite well shes the envy of every girl in buffalo the king went to her wedding i also knew fitzherberts sister maud a wonderful woman she married walter von ulrich a german i would have married her myself if walter hadnt got to her first woody raised his eyebrows it was not like papa to talk this way that was before i fell in love with your mother of course of course woody smothered a grin walter and maud dropped out of sight after hitler banned the social democrats i hope theyre all right if theres a war woody saw that talk of war had put his father in a reminiscent mood at least america isnt involved thats what we thought last time gus changed the subject what do you hear from your kid brother woody sighed hes not going to change his mind papa he wont go to harvard or any other university this was a family crisis chuck had announced that as soon as he was eighteen he was going to join the navy without a college degree he would be an enlisted man with no prospect of ever becoming an officer this horrified his highachieving parents hes bright enough for college damn it said gus he beats me at chess he beats me too so whats his problem he hates to study and he loves boats sailing is the only thing he cares about woody looked at his wristwatch youve got a party to go to his father said theres no hurry sure there is shes a very attractive girl get the hell out of here woody grinned his father could be surprisingly smart thanks papa he got up greg peshkov was leaving at the same time and they went out together hello woody how are things greg said amiably turning in the same direction there had been a time when woody wanted to punch greg for his part in what had been done to dave rouzrokh his feelings had cooled over the years and in truth it was lev peshkov who had been responsible not his son who had then been only fifteen all the same woody was no more than polite im enjoying washington he said walking along one of the citys wide parisian boulevards how about you i like it they soon get over their surprise at my name seeing woodys enquiring look greg explained the state department is all smiths fabers jensens and mcallisters no one called kozinsky or cohen or papadopoulos woody realized it was true government was carried on by a rather exclusive little ethnic group why had he not noticed that before perhaps because it had been the same in school in church and at harvard greg went on but theyre not narrowminded theyll make an exception for someone who speaks fluent russian and comes from a wealthy family greg was being flippant but there was an undertone of real resentment and woody saw that the guy had a serious chip on his shoulder they think my father is a gangster greg said but they dont really mind most rich people have a gangster somewhere in their ancestry you sound as if you hate washington on the contrary i wouldnt be anywhere else the power is here woody felt he was more highminded im here because there are things i want to do changes i want to make greg grinned same thing i guess power hmm woody had not thought of it that way greg said do you think there will be war in europe you should know youre in the state department yeah but im in the press office all i know is the fairy tales we tell reporters i have no idea what the truth is heck i dont know either ive just been with the president and i dont think even he knows my sister daisy is over there gregs tone had changed his worry was evidently genuine and woody warmed to him i know if theres bombing even women and children wont be safe do you think the germans will bomb london there was only one honest answer i guess they will i wish shed come home maybe there wont be a war chamberlain the british premier made a lastminute deal with hitler over czechoslovakia last year a lastminute sellout right so perhaps hell do the same over poland although time is running out greg nodded glumly and changed the subject where are you headed to joanne rouzrokhs apartment shes giving a party i heard about it i know one of her roommates but im not invited as you could probably guess her building is good god greg stopped in midsentence woody stopped too greg was staring ahead following his gaze woody saw that he was looking at an attractive black woman walking towards them on e street she was about their age and pretty with wide pinkybrown lips that made woody think about kissing she had on a plain black dress that might have been part of a waitress uniform but she wore it with a cute hat and fashionable shoes that gave her a stylish look she saw the two of them caught gregs eye and looked away greg said jacky jacky jakes the girl ignored him and kept walking but woody thought she looked troubled greg said jacky its me greg peshkov jacky if it were she did not respond but she looked as if she might be about to burst into tears jacky real name mabel you know me greg stood in the middle of the sidewalk with his arms spread in a gesture of appeal she deliberately went around him not speaking or meeting his eye and walked on greg turned wait a minute he called after her you ran out on me four years ago you owe me an explanation this was uncharacteristic of greg woody thought he had always been such a smooth operator with girls at school and at harvard now he seemed genuinely upset bewildered hurt almost desperate four years ago woody reflected could this be the girl in the scandal it had taken place here in washington no doubt she lived here greg ran after her a cab had stopped at the corner and the passenger a man in a tuxedo was standing at the kerb paying the driver jacky jumped in slamming the door greg went to the window and shouted through it talk to me please the man in the tuxedo said keep the change and walked away the cab moved off leaving greg staring after it he slowly returned to where woody stood waiting intrigued i dont understand it greg said woody said she looked frightened what of i never did her any harm i was crazy about her well she was scared of something greg seemed to shake himself sorry he said not your problem anyway my apologies not at all greg pointed to an apartment block a few steps away thats joannes building he said have a good time then he walked away somewhat bemused woody went to the entrance but he soon forgot about gregs romantic life and started to think about his own did joanne really like him she might not kiss him this evening but maybe he could ask her for a date this was a modest apartment house with no doorman or hall porter a list in the lobby revealed that rouzrokh shared her place with stewart and fisher presumably two other girls woody went up in the elevator he realized he was emptyhanded he should have brought candy or flowers he thought about going back to buy something then decided that would be taking good manners too far he rang the bell a girl in her early twenties opened the door woody said hello im come on in she said not waiting to hear his name the drinks are in the kitchen and theres food on the table in the living room if theres any left she turned away clearly thinking she had given him sufficient welcome the small apartment was packed with people drinking smoking and shouting at one another over the noise of the phonograph joanne had said a few friends and woody had imagined eight or ten young people sitting around a coffee table discussing the crisis in europe he was disappointed this overcrowded bash would give him little opportunity to demonstrate to joanne how much he had grown up he looked around for her he was taller than most people and could see over their heads she was not in sight he pushed through the crowd searching for her a girl with plump breasts and nice brown eyes looked up at him as he squeezed past and said hello big guy im diana taverner whats your name im looking for joanne he said she shrugged good luck with that she turned away he made his way into the kitchen the noise level dropped a fraction joanne was nowhere to be seen but he decided to get a drink while he was there a broadshouldered man of about thirty was rattling a cocktail shaker well dressed in a tan suit paleblue shirt and darkblue tie he clearly was not a barman but was acting like a host scotch is over there he said to another guest help yourself im making martinis for anyone whos interested woody said got any bourbon right here the man passed him a bottle im bexforth ross woody dewar woody found a glass and poured bourbon ice in that bucket said bexforth where are you from woody im an intern in the senate you i work in the state department im in charge of the italy desk he started passing martinis around clearly a rising star woody thought the man had so much selfconfidence it was irritating i was looking for joanne shes somewhere around how do you know her here woody felt he could show clear superiority oh were old friends he said airily in fact ive known her all my life we were kids together in buffalo how about you bexforth took a long sip of martini and gave a satisfied sigh then he looked speculatively at woody i havent known joanne as long as you have he said but i guess i know her better how so im planning to marry her woody felt as if he had been slapped marry her yes isnt that great woody could not hide his dismay does she know about this bexforth laughed and patted woodys shoulder condescendingly she sure does and shes all for it im the luckiest guy in the world clearly bexforth had divined that woody was attracted to joanne woody felt a fool congratulations he said dispiritedly thank you and now i must circulate good talking to you woody my pleasure bexforth moved away woody put his drink down untasted fuck it he said quietly then he left iv the first day of september was sultry in berlin carla von ulrich woke up sweaty and uncomfortable her bedsheets thrown off during the warm night she looked out of her bedroom window to see low grey clouds hanging over the city keeping heat in like a saucepan lid today was a big day for her in fact it would determine the course of her life she stood in front of the mirror she had her mothers colouring the dark hair and green eyes of the fitzherberts she was prettier than maud who had an angular face striking rather than beautiful yet there was a bigger difference her mother attracted just about every man she met carla by contrast could not flirt she watched other girls her age doing it simpering pulling their sweaters tight over their breasts tossing their hair and batting their eyelashes and she just felt embarrassed her mother was more subtle of course so that men hardly knew they were being enchanted but it was essentially the same game today however carla did not want to appear sexy on the contrary she needed to look practical sensible and capable she put on a plain stonecoloured cotton dress that came to midcalf stepped into her flat unglamorous school sandals and wove her hair into two plaits in the approved germanmaiden fashion the mirror showed her an ideal girl student conservative dull sexless she was up and dressed before the rest of the family the maid ada was in the kitchen and carla helped her set out the breakfast things her brother appeared next erik nineteen and sporting a clipped black moustache supported the nazis infuriating the rest of his family he was a student at the charité the medical school of the university of berlin as was his best friend and fellownazi hermann braun the von ulrichs could not afford tuition fees of course but erik had won a scholarship carla had applied for the same scholarship to study at the same institution her interview was today if she was successful she would study and become a doctor if not she had no idea what else she would do the coming to power of the nazis had ruined her parents lives her father was no longer a deputy in the reichstag having lost his job when the socialdemocratic party became illegal along with all other parties except for the nazis there was no work her father could do that would use his expertise as a politician and a diplomat he scraped a living translating german newspaper articles for the british embassy where he still had a few friends mother had once been a famous leftwing journalist but newspapers were no longer allowed to publish her articles carla found it heartbreaking she was deeply devoted to her family which included ada she was saddened by the decline in her father who in her childhood had been a hardworking and politically powerful man and was now simply defeated even worse was the brave face put on by her mother a famous suffragette leader in england before the war now scraping a few marks by giving piano lessons but they said they could bear anything as long as their children grew up to lead happy and fulfilled lives carla had always taken it for granted that she would spend her life making the world a better place as her parents had she did not know whether she would have followed her father into politics or her mother into journalism but both were out of the question now what else was she to do under a government that prized ruthlessness and brutality above all else her brother had given her the clue doctors made the world a better place regardless of the government so she had made it her ambition to go to medical school she had studied harder than any other girl in her class and she had passed every exam with top marks especially the sciences she was better qualified than her brother to win a scholarship there are no girls at all in my year erik said he sounded grumpy carla thought he disliked the idea of her following in his footsteps their parents were proud of his achievements despite his repellent politics perhaps he was afraid of being outshone carla said all my grades are better than yours biology chemistry maths all right all right and the scholarship is available to female students in principle i checked their mother came in at the end of this exchange dressed in a grey wateredsilk bathrobe with the cord doubled around her narrow waist they should follow their own rules she said this is germany after all mother said she loved her adopted country and perhaps she did but since the coming of the nazis she had taken to making wearily ironic remarks carla dipped bread into milky coffee how will you feel mother if england attacks germany miserably unhappy as i felt last time she replied i was married to your father throughout the great war and every day for more than four years i was terrified that he would be killed erik said in a challenging tone but whose side will you take im german she said i married for better or worse of course we never foresaw anything as wicked and oppressive as this nazi regime no one did erik grunted in protest and she ignored him but a vow is a vow and anyway i love your father carla said were not at war yet not quite said mother if the poles have any sense they will back down and give hitler what he asks for they should said erik germany is strong now we can take what we want whether they like it or not mother rolled her eyes god spare us a car horn sounded outside carla smiled a minute later her friend frieda franck entered the kitchen she was going to accompany carla to the interview just to give moral support she too was dressed in soberschoolgirl fashion though she unlike carla had a wardrobe full of stylish clothes she was followed in by her older brother carla thought werner franck was wonderful unlike so many handsome boys he was kind and thoughtful and funny he had once been very left wing but all that seemed to have faded away and he was nonpolitical now he had had a string of beautiful and stylish girlfriends if carla had known how to flirt she would have started with him mother said id offer you coffee werner but ours is ersatz and i know you have the real thing at home shall i steal some from our kitchen for you frau von ulrich he said i think you deserve it mother blushed slightly and carla realized with a twinge of disapproval that even at fortyeight mother was susceptible to werners charm werner glanced at a gold wristwatch i have to go he said life is completely frantic at the air ministry these days frieda said thank you for the lift carla said to frieda wait a minute if you came in werners car wheres your bike outside we strapped it to the back of the car the two girls belonged to the mercury cycling club and went everywhere by bike werner said best wishes for the interview carla bye everyone carla swallowed the last of her bread as she was about to leave her father came down he had not shaved or put on a tie he had been quite plump when carla was a girl but now he was thin he kissed carla affectionately mother said we havent listened to the news she turned on the radio that stood on the shelf while the set was warming up carla and frieda left the house so they did not hear the news the university hospital was in mitte the central area of berlin where the von ulrichs lived so carla and frieda had a short bicycle ride carla began to feel nervous the fumes from car exhausts nauseated her and she wished she had not eaten breakfast they reached the hospital a new building put up in the twenties and found their way to the room of professor bayer who had the job of recommending a student for the scholarship a haughty secretary said they were early and told them to wait carla wished she had worn a hat and gloves that would have made her look older and more authoritative like someone sick people would trust the secretary might have been polite to a girl in a hat the wait was long but carla was sorry when it came to an end and the secretary said the professor was ready to see her frieda whispered good luck carla went in bayer was a thin man in his forties with a small grey moustache he sat behind a desk wearing a tan linen jacket over the waistcoat of a grey business suit on the wall was a photograph of him shaking hands with hitler he did not greet carla but barked what is an imaginary number she was taken aback by his abruptness but at least it was an easy question the square root of a negative real number for example the square root of minus one she said in a shaky voice it cannot be assigned a real numerical value but can nevertheless be used in calculations he seemed a bit surprised perhaps he had expected to floor her completely correct he said after a momentary hesitation she looked around there was no chair for her was she to be interviewed standing up he asked her some questions on chemistry and biology all of which she answered easily she began to feel a bit less nervous then he suddenly said do you faint at the sight of blood no sir aha he said triumphantly how do you know i delivered a baby when i was eleven years old she said that was quite bloody you should have sent for a doctor i did she said indignantly but babies dont wait for doctors hmm bayer stood up wait there he left the room carla stayed where she was she was being subjected to a harsh test but so far she thought she was doing all right fortunately she was used to giveandtake arguments with men and women of all ages combative discussions were commonplace in the von ulrich house and she had been holding her own with her parents and brother for as long as she could remember bayer was gone for several minutes what was he doing had he gone to fetch a colleague to meet this unprecedentedly brilliant girl applicant that seemed too much to hope for she was tempted to pick up one of the books on his shelf and read but she was scared of offending him so she stood still and did nothing he came back after ten minutes with a pack of cigarettes surely he had not kept her standing in the middle of the room all this time while he went to the tobacconists shop or was that another test she began to feel angry he took his time lighting up as if he needed to collect his thoughts he blew out smoke and said how would you as a woman deal with a man who had an infection of the penis she was embarrassed and felt herself blush she had never discussed the penis with a man but she knew she had to be robust about such things if she wanted to be a doctor in the same way that you as a man would deal with a vaginal infection she said he looked horrified and she feared she had been insolent hastily she went on i would examine the infected area carefully try to establish the nature of the infection and probably treat it with sulphonamide although i have to admit we did not cover this in my school biology course he said sceptically have you ever seen a naked man yes he affected to be outraged but you are a single girl when my grandfather was dying he was bedridden and incontinent i helped my mother keep him clean she could not manage on her own he was too heavy she tried a smile women do these things all the time professor for the very young and the very old the sick and the helpless were used to it its only men who find such tasks embarrassing he was looking more and more cross even though she was answering well what was going wrong it was almost as if he would have been happier for her to be intimidated by his manner and to give stupid replies he put out his cigarette thoughtfully in the ashtray on his desk im afraid you are not suitable as a candidate for this scholarship he said she was astonished how had she failed she had answered every question why not she said my qualifications are irreproachable you are unwomanly you talk freely of the vagina and the penis it was you who started that i merely answered your question you have clearly been brought up in a coarse environment where you saw the nakedness of your male relatives do you think old peoples diapers should be changed by men id like to see you do it worst of all you are disrespectful and insolent you asked me challenging questions if i had given you timid replies you would have said i wasnt tough enough to be a doctor wouldnt you he was momentarily speechless and she realized that was exactly what he would have done youve wasted my time she said and she went to the door get married he said produce children for the führer thats your role in life do your duty she went out and slammed the door frieda looked up in alarm what happened carla headed for the exit without replying she caught the eye of the secretary who looked pleased clearly knowing what had happened carla said to her you can wipe that smirk off your face you driedup old bitch she had the satisfaction of seeing the womans shock and horror outside the building she said to frieda he had no intention of recommending me for the scholarship because im a woman my qualifications were irrelevant i did all that work for nothing then she burst into tears frieda put her arms around her after a minute she felt better im not going to raise children for the damned führer she muttered what lets go home ill tell you when we get there they climbed on to their bikes there was a strange air in the streets but carla was too full of her own woes to wonder what was going on people were gathering around the loudspeakers that sometimes broadcast hitlers speeches from the kroll opera the building that was being used instead of the burnedout reichstag presumably he was about to speak when they got back to the von ulrich town house mother and father were still in the kitchen father sitting next to the radio with a frown of concentration they turned me down carla said regardless of what their rules say they dont want to give a scholarship to a girl oh carla im so sorry said mother whats on the radio havent you heard said mother we invaded poland this morning were at war v the london season was over but most people were still in town because of the crisis parliament normally in recess at this time of year had been specially recalled but there were no parties no royal receptions no balls it was like being at a seaside resort in february daisy thought today was saturday and she was getting ready to go to dinner at the home of her fatherinlaw earl fitzherbert what could be more dull she sat at her dressing table wearing an evening gown in eaudenil silk with a vneck and a pleated skirt she had silk flowers in her hair and a fortune in diamonds round her neck her husband boy was getting ready in his dressing room she was pleased he was here he spent many nights elsewhere although they lived in the same mayfair house sometimes several days would go by without their meeting but he was at home tonight she held in her hand a letter from her mother in buffalo olga had divined that daisy was discontented in her marriage there must have been hints in daisys letters home mother had good intuition i only want you to be happy she wrote so listen when i tell you not to give up too soon youre going to be countess fitzherbert one day and your son if you have one will be the earl you might regret throwing all that away just because your husband didnt pay you enough attention she might be right people had been addressing daisy as my lady for almost three years yet it still gave her a little jolt of pleasure every time like a puff on a cigarette but boy seemed to think that marriage need make no great difference to his life he spent evenings with his men friends travelled all over the country to go horse racing and rarely told his wife what his plans were daisy found it embarrassing to go to a party and be surprised to meet her husband there but if she wanted to know where he was going she had to ask his valet and that was too demeaning would he gradually grow up and start to behave as a husband should or would he always be like this he put his head around her door come on daisy were late she put mothers letter in a drawer locked it and went out boy was waiting in the hall wearing a tuxedo fitz had at last succumbed to fashion and permitted informal short dinner jackets for family dinners at home they could have walked to fitzs house but it was raining so boy had had the car brought round it was a bentley airline saloon creamcoloured with whitewall tyres boy shared his fathers love of beautiful cars boy drove daisy hoped he would let her drive back she enjoyed it and anyway he was not safe after dinner especially on wet roads london was preparing for war barrage balloons floated over the city at a height of two thousand feet to impede bombers in case that failed sandbags were stacked outside important buildings alternate kerbstones had been painted white for the benefit of drivers in the blackout which had begun yesterday there were white stripes on large trees street statues and other obstacles that might cause accidents princess bea welcomed boy and daisy in her fifties she was quite fat but she still dressed like a girl tonight she wore a pink gown embroidered with beads and sequins she never spoke about the story daisys father had told at the wedding but she had stopped hinting that daisy was socially inferior and now always spoke to daisy with courtesy if not warmth daisy was cautiously friendly and treated bea like a slightly dotty aunt boys younger brother andy was there he and may had two children and may looked to daisys interested eye as if she might be expecting a third boy wanted a son of course to be heir to the fitzherbert title and fortune but so far daisy had failed to get pregnant it was a sore point and the evident fecundity of andy and may made it worse daisy would have had a better chance if boy spent more nights at home she was delighted to see her friend eva murray there but without her husband jimmy murray now a captain was with his unit and had not been able to get away for most troops were in barracks and their officers were with them eva was family now because jimmy was mays brother and therefore an inlaw so boy had been forced to overcome his prejudice against jews and be polite to eva eva adored jimmy as much now as she had three years ago when she had married him they too had produced two children in three years but eva looked worried tonight and daisy could guess why how are your parents she said they cant get out of germany eva said miserably the government wont give them exit visas cant fitz help hes tried what have they done to deserve this its not them particularly there are thousands of german jews in the same position only a few get visas im so sorry daisy was more than sorry she squirmed with embarrassment when she recalled how she and boy had supported the fascists in the early days her doubts had grown rapidly as the brutality of fascism at home and abroad had become more and more obvious and in the end she had been relieved when fitz had complained that they were embarrassing him and had begged them to leave mosleys party now daisy felt she had been an utter fool ever to have joined in the first place boy was not quite so repentant he still thought that upperclass white europeans formed a superior species chosen by god to rule the earth but he no longer believed that was a practical political philosophy he was often infuriated by british democracy but he did not advocate abolishing it they sat down to dinner early neville is making a statement in the house of commons at half past seven fitz said neville chamberlain was prime minister i want to see it i shall sit in the peers gallery i may have to leave you before dessert andy said what do you think will happen papa i really dont know fitz said with a touch of exasperation of course we would all like to avoid a war but its important not to give an impression of indecision daisy was surprised fitz believed in loyalty and rarely criticized his government colleagues even as obliquely as this princess bea said if there is a war i shall go and live in tŷ gwyn fitz shook his head if there is a war the government will ask owners of large country houses to put them at the disposal of the military for the duration as a member of the government i must set an example i shall have to lend tŷ gwyn to the welsh rifles for use as a training centre or possibly a hospital bea was outraged but it is my country house we may reserve a small part of the premises for private use i dont choose to live in a small part of the premises i am a princess it might be cosy we could use the butlers pantry as a kitchen and the breakfast room as a dining room plus three or four of the smaller bedrooms cosy bea looked disgusted as if something unpleasant had been set before her but she said no more andy said presumably boy and i will have to join the welsh rifles may made a noise in her throat like a sob boy said i shall join the air force fitz was shocked but you cant the viscount aberowen has always been in the welsh rifles they havent got any planes the next war will be an air war the raf will be desperate for pilots and ive been flying for years fitz was about to argue but the butler came in and said the car is ready my lord fitz looked at the clock on the mantelpiece dash it ive got to go thank you grout he looked at boy dont make a final decision until weve talked some more this is not right very well papa fitz looked at bea forgive me my dear for leaving in the middle of dinner of course she said fitz got up from the table and walked to the door daisy noticed his limp a grim reminder of what the last war had done the rest of dinner was gloomy they were all wondering whether the prime minister would declare war when the ladies got up to withdraw may asked andy to take her arm he excused himself to the two remaining men saying my wife is in a delicate condition it was the usual euphemism for pregnancy boy said i wish my wife were as quick to get delicate it was a cheap shot and daisy felt herself blush bright red she repressed a retort then asked herself why she should be silent you know what footballers say boy she said loudly you have to shoot to score it was boys turn to blush how dare you he said furiously andy laughed you asked for it brother bea said stop it both of you i expect my sons to wait until the ladies are out of earshot before indulging in such disgusting talk she swept out of the room daisy followed but she parted company from the other women on the landing and went on upstairs still feeling angry wanting to be alone how could boy say such a thing did he really believe it had to be her fault that she was not pregnant it could just as easily be his perhaps he knew that and tried to blame her because he was afraid people would think he was infertile that was probably the truth but it was no excuse for a public insult she went to his old room after they had married the two of them had lived here for three months while their own house was being redecorated they had used boys old bedroom and the one next door although in those days they had slept together every night she went in and turned on the light to her surprise she saw that boy appeared not to have completely moved out there was a razor on the wash stand and a copy of flight magazine on the bedside table she opened a drawer and found a tin of leonards liveraid which he took every morning before breakfast did he sleep here when he was too disgustingly drunk to face his wife the lower drawer was locked but she knew he kept the key in a pot on the mantelpiece she had no qualms about prying in her view a husband should have no secrets from his wife she opened the drawer the first thing she found was a book of photographs of naked women in artistic paintings and photographs the women generally posed to half conceal their private parts but these girls were doing the opposite legs akimbo buttocks held open even the lips of their vaginas spread to show the inside daisy would pretend to be shocked if anyone caught her but in truth she was fascinated she looked through the entire book with great interest comparing the women with herself the size and shape of their breasts the amount of hair their sexual organs what a wonderful variety there was in womens bodies some of the girls were stimulating themselves or pretending to and some were photographed in pairs doing it to each other daisy was not really surprised that men liked this sort of thing she felt like an eavesdropper it reminded her of the time she had gone to his room at tŷ gwyn before they were married then she had been desperate to learn more about him to gain intimate knowledge of the man she loved to find a way to make him her own what was she doing now spying on a husband who seemed no longer to love her trying to understand where she had failed beneath the book was a brown paper bag inside were several small square paper envelopes white with red lettering on the front she read prentif reg trade mark servispak notice do not leave the envelope or contents in public places as this is likely to cause offence british made latex rubber withstands all climates none of it made any sense nowhere did it say what the package actually contained so she opened it inside was a piece of rubber she unfolded it it was shaped like a tube closed at one end she took a few seconds to figure out what it was she had never seen one but she had heard people talk about such things americans called it a trojan the british a rubber johnny the correct term was condom and it was to stop you getting pregnant why did her husband have a bag of them there could be only one answer they were to be used with another woman she felt like crying she had given him everything he wanted she had never told him she was too tired to make love even when she was nor had she refused anything he suggested in bed she would even have posed like the women in the book of photographs if he had asked her to what had she done wrong she decided to ask him sorrow turned to anger she stood up she would take the paper packets down to the dining room and confront him with them why should she protect his feelings at that moment he walked in i saw the light from the hall he said what are you doing in here he looked at the open drawers of the bedside cupboard and said how dare you spy on me i suspected you of being unfaithful she said she held up the condom and i was right damn you for a sneak damn you for an adulterer he raised his hand i should beat you like a victorian husband she snatched a heavy candlestick from the mantelpiece try it and ill bop you like a twentiethcentury wife this is ridiculous he sat down heavily on a chair by the door looking defeated his evident unhappiness deflated daisys rage and she just felt sad she sat on the bed but she had not lost her curiosity who is she he shook his head never mind i want to know he shifted uncomfortably does it matter it sure does she knew she would get it out of him eventually he would not meet her eye nobody you know or would ever know a prostitute he was stung by this suggestion no she goaded him further do you pay her no yes he was clearly ashamed enough to wish to deny it well an allowance its not the same thing why do you pay if shes not a prostitute so they dont have to see anyone else they you have several mistresses no only two they live in aldgate mother and daughter what you cant be serious well one day joanie was the french say elle avait les fleurs american girls call it the curse so pearl offered to act as a substitute this is the most sordid arrangement imaginable so you go to bed with them both yes she thought of the book of photographs and an outrageous possibility occurred to her she had to ask not at the same time occasionally how utterly foul you dont need to worry about disease he pointed to the condom in her hand those things prevent infection im overwhelmed by your thoughtfulness look most men do this sort of thing you know at least most men of our class no they dont she said but she thought of her father who had a wife and a longtime mistress and still felt the need to romance gladys angelus boy said my father isnt a faithful husband he has bastards all over the place i dont believe you i think he loves your mother he has one bastard for certain where i dont know then you cant be sure i heard him say something to bing westhampton once you know what bing is like i do said daisy this seemed a moment for telling the truth so she added he feels my bottom every chance he gets dirty old man anyway we were all a bit drunk and bing said most of us have got one or two bastards hidden away havent we and papa said im pretty sure ive only got one then he seemed to realize what hed said and he coughed and looked foolish and changed the subject well i dont care how many bastards your father has im a modern american girl and i wont live with an unfaithful husband what can you do about it ill leave you she put on a defiant expression but she felt in pain as if he had stabbed her and go back to buffalo with your tail between your legs perhaps or i could do something else ive got plenty of money her fathers lawyers had made sure boy did not get his hands on the vyalovpeshkov fortune when they married i could go to california act in one of fathers movies become a film star i bet you i could this was all pretence she wanted to burst into tears leave me then he said go to hell for all i care she wondered if that was true looking at his face she thought not they heard a car daisy pulled the blackout curtain aside an inch and saw fitzs blackandcream rollsroyce outside its headlights dimmed by slit masks your fathers back she said i wonder if were at war wed better go down ill follow you boy went out and daisy looked in the mirror she was surprised to see that she looked no different from the woman who had walked in here half an hour ago her life had been turned upsidedown but there was no sign of it on her face she felt terribly sorry for herself and wanted to cry but she repressed the urge steeling herself she went downstairs fitz was in the dining room with raindrops on the shoulders of his dinner jacket grout the butler had set out cheese and fruit as fitz had skipped dessert the family sat around the table as grout poured a glass of claret for fitz he drank some and said it was absolutely dreadful andy said what on earth happened fitz ate a corner of cheddar cheese before answering neville spoke for four minutes it was the worst performance by a prime minister that i have ever seen he mumbled and prevaricated and said germany might withdraw from poland which no one believes he said nothing about war or even an ultimatum andy said but why privately neville says hes waiting for the french to stop dithering and declare war simultaneously with us but a lot of people suspect thats just a cowardly excuse fitz took another draught of wine arthur greenwood spoke next greenwood was deputy leader of the labour party as he stood up leo amery a conservative member of parliament mind you shouted out speak for england arthur to think that a damned socialist might speak for england where a conservative prime minister has failed neville looked as sick as a dog grout refilled fitzs glass greenwood was quite mild but he did say i wonder how long we are prepared to vacillate and at that mps on both sides of the house roared their approval i should think neville wanted the earth to swallow him up fitz took a peach and sliced it with a knife and fork andy said how were things left nothing is resolved neville has gone back to number ten downing street but most of the cabinet is holed up in simons room at the commons sir john simon was chancellor of the exchequer theyre saying they wont leave the room until neville sends the germans an ultimatum meanwhile labours national executive committee is in session and discontented backbenchers are meeting in winstons flat daisy had always said she did not like politics but since becoming part of fitzs family and seeing everything from the inside she had become interested and she found this drama fascinating and scary then the prime minister must act she said oh certainly said fitz before parliament meets again which should be at noon tomorrow i think neville must either declare war or resign the phone rang in the hall and grout went out to answer it a minute later he came back and said that was the foreign office my lord the gentleman would not wait for you to come to the telephone but insisted on giving a message the old butler looked disconcerted as if he had been spoken to rather sharply the prime minister has called an immediate meeting of the cabinet movement said fitz good grout went on the foreign secretary would like you to be in attendance if convenient fitz was not in the cabinet but junior ministers were sometimes asked to attend meetings on their area of specialization sitting at the side of the room rather than at the central table so that they could answer questions of detail bea looked at the clock its almost eleven i suppose you must go indeed i must the phrase if convenient is an empty courtesy he patted his lips with a snowy napkin and limped out again princess bea said make some more coffee grout and bring it to the drawing room we may be up late tonight yes your highness they all returned to the drawing room talking animatedly eva was in favour of war she wanted to see the nazi regime destroyed she would worry about jimmy of course but she had married a soldier and had always known he might have to risk his life in battle bea was prowar too now that the germans were allied with the bolsheviks she hated may feared that andy would be killed and could not stop crying boy did not see why two great nations such as england and germany should go to war over a halfbarbaric wasteland such as poland as soon as she could daisy got eva to go with her to another room where they could talk privately boys got a mistress she said immediately she showed eva the condoms i found these oh daisy im so sorry eva said daisy thought of giving eva the grisly details they normally told each other everything but this time daisy felt too humiliated so she just said i confronted him and he admitted it is he sorry not very he says all men of his class do it including his father jimmy doesnt eva said decisively no im sure youre right what will you do im going to leave him we can get divorced then someone else can be the viscountess but you cant if theres a war why not its too cruel when hes on the battlefield he should have thought of that before he slept with a pair of prostitutes in aldgate but it would be cowardly as well you cant dump a man who is risking his life to protect you reluctantly daisy saw evas point war would transform boy from a despicable adulterer who deserved rejection into a hero defending his wife his mother and his country from the terror of invasion and conquest it was not just that everyone in london and buffalo would see daisy as a coward for leaving him she would feel that way herself if there was a war she wanted to be brave even though she was not sure what that might involve youre right she said grudgingly i cant leave him if theres a war there was a clap of thunder daisy looked at the clock it was midnight the rain altered in sound as a torrential downpour began daisy and eva returned to the drawing room bea was asleep on a couch andy had his arm around may who was still snivelling boy was smoking a cigar and drinking brandy daisy decided that she would definitely be driving home fitz came in at half past midnight his evening suit soaking wet the dithering is over he said neville will send the germans an ultimatum in the morning if they do not begin to withdraw their troops from poland by midday eleven oclock our time we will be at war they all got up and prepared to leave in the hall daisy said ill drive and boy did not argue with her they got into the cream bentley and daisy started the engine grout closed the door of fitzs house daisy turned on the windscreen wipers but did not pull away boy she said lets try again what do you mean i dont really want to leave you i certainly dont want you to go give up those women in aldgate sleep with me every night lets really try for a baby its what you want isnt it yes then will you do as i ask there was a long pause then he said all right thank you she looked at him hoping for a kiss but he sat still looking straight ahead through the windscreen as the rhythmic wipers swept away the relentless rain vi on sunday the rain stopped and the sun came out lloyd williams felt as if london had been washed clean during the course of the morning the williams family gathered in the kitchen of ethels house in aldgate there was no prior arrangement they turned up spontaneously they wanted to be together lloyd guessed if war was declared lloyd longed for action against the fascists and at the same time dreaded the prospect of war in spain he had seen enough bloodshed and suffering for a lifetime he wished never to take part in another battle he had even given up boxing yet he hoped with all his heart that chamberlain would not back down he had seen for himself what fascism meant in germany and the rumours coming out of spain were equally nightmarish the franco regime was murdering former supporters of the elected government in their hundreds and thousands and the priests were in control of the schools again this summer after he had graduated he had immediately joined the welsh rifles and as a former member of the officer training corps he had been given the rank of lieutenant the army was energetically preparing for combat it was only with the greatest difficulty that he had got a twentyfour hour pass to visit his mother this weekend if the prime minister declared war today lloyd would be among the first to go billy williams came to the house in nutley street after breakfast on sunday morning lloyd and bernie were sitting by the radio newspapers open on the kitchen table while ethel prepared a leg of pork for dinner uncle billy almost wept when he saw lloyd in uniform it makes me think of our dave thats all he said hed be a conscript now if hed come back from spain lloyd had never told billy the truth about how dave had died he pretended he did not know the details just that dave had been killed in action at belchite and was presumably buried there billy had been in the great war and knew how haphazardly bodies were dealt with on the battlefield and that probably made his grief worse his great hope was to visit belchite one day when spain was freed at last and to pay his respects to the son who died fighting in that great cause lenny griffiths was another who had never returned from spain no one had any idea where he might be buried it was even possible he was still alive in one of francos prison camps now the radio reported prime minister chamberlains statement to the house of commons last night but nothing further youd never know what a stink there was afterwards said billy the bbc doesnt report stinks said lloyd they like to sound reassuring both billy and lloyd were members of the labour partys national executive lloyd as the representative of the partys youth section after he had come back from spain he had managed to gain readmission to cambridge university and while finishing his studies he had toured the country addressing labour party groups telling people how the elected spanish government had been betrayed by britains fascistfriendly government it had done no good francos antidemocracy rebels had won anyway but lloyd had become a wellknown figure even something of a hero especially among young leftwingers hence his election to the executive so both lloyd and uncle billy had been at last nights committee meeting they knew that chamberlain had bowed to pressure from the cabinet and sent the ultimatum to hitler now they were waiting on tenterhooks to see what would happen as far as they knew no response had yet been received from hitler lloyd recalled his mothers friend maud and her family in berlin those two little children would be eighteen and nineteen now he calculated he wondered if they were sitting around a radio wondering whether they were going to war against england at ten oclock lloyds halfsister millie arrived she was now nineteen and married to her friend naomi averys brother abe a leather wholesaler she earned good money as a salesgirl on commission in an expensive dress shop she had ambitions to open her own shop and lloyd had no doubt that she would do it one day although it was not the career bernie would have chosen for her lloyd could see how proud he was of her brains and ambition and smart appearance but today her poised selfassurance had collapsed it was awful when you were in spain she said tearfully to lloyd and dave and lenny never did come back now it will be you and my abie off somewhere and us women waiting every day for news wondering if youre dead yet ethel put in and your cousin keir hes eighteen now lloyd said to his mother which regiment was my real father in oh does it matter she was never keen to talk about lloyds father perhaps out of consideration for bernie but lloyd wanted to know it matters to me he said she threw a peeled potato into a pan of water with unnecessary vigour he was in the welsh rifles the same as me why didnt you tell me before the past is the past there might be another reason for her caginess lloyd knew she had probably been pregnant when she married this did not bother lloyd but to her generation it was shameful all the same he persisted was my father welsh yes from aberowen no where then she sighed his parents moved around something to do with his fathers job but i think they were from swansea originally satisfied now yes lloyds aunt mildred came in from church a stylish middleaged woman pretty except for protruding front teeth she wore a fancy hat she was a milliner with a small factory her two daughters by her first marriage enid and lillian both in their late twenties were married with children of their own her elder son was the dave who had died in spain her younger son keir followed her into the kitchen mildred insisted on taking her children to church even though her husband billy would have nothing to do with religion i had a lifetimes worth of that when i was a child he often said if im not saved no one is lloyd looked around this was his family mother stepfather halfsister uncle aunt cousin he did not want to leave them and go away to die somewhere lloyd looked at his watch a stainlesssteel model with a square face that bernie had given him as a graduation present it was eleven oclock on the radio the fruity voice of newsreader alvar lidell said the prime minister was expected to make an announcement shortly then there was some solemn classical music hush now everyone said ethel ill make you all a cup of tea after the kitchen went quiet alvar lidell announced the prime minister neville chamberlain the appeaser of fascism lloyd thought the man who gave czechoslovakia to hitler the man who had stubbornly refused to help the elected government of spain even after it became indisputably obvious that the germans and italians were arming the rebels was he about to cave in yet again lloyd noticed that his parents were holding hands ethels small fingers digging into bernies palm he checked his watch again it was a quarter past eleven then they heard the prime minister say i am speaking to you from the cabinet room at ten downing street chamberlains voice was reedy and overprecise he sounded like a pedantic schoolmaster what we need is a warrior lloyd thought this morning the british ambassador in berlin handed the german government a final note stating that unless the british government heard from them by eleven oclock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from poland a state of war would exist between us lloyd found himself feeling impatient with chamberlains verbiage a state of war would exist between us what a strange way to put it get on with it he thought get to the point this is life and death chamberlains voice deepened and became more statesmanlike perhaps he was no longer looking at the microphone but instead seeing millions of his countrymen in their homes sitting by their radio sets waiting for his fateful words i have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received lloyd heard his mother say oh god spare us he looked at her her face was grey chamberlain uttered his next dreadful words quite slowly and that consequently this country is at war with germany ethel began to cry part two a season of blood i aberowen had changed there were cars trucks and buses on the streets when lloyd had come here as a child in the s to visit his grandparents a parked car had been a rarity that would draw a crowd but the town was still dominated by the twin towers of the pithead with their majestically revolving wheels there was nothing else no factories no office blocks no industry other than coal almost every man in town worked down the pit there were a few dozen exceptions some shopkeepers numerous clergymen of all denominations a town clerk a doctor whenever the demand for coal slumped as it had in the thirties and men were laid off there was nothing else for them to do that was why the labour partys most passionate demand was help for the unemployed so that such men would never again suffer the agony and humiliation of being unable to feed their families lieutenant lloyd williams arrived by train from cardiff on a sunday in april carrying a small suitcase he walked up the hill to tŷ gwyn he had spent eight months training new recruits the same work he had done in spain and coaching the welsh rifles boxing team but the army had at last realized that he spoke fluent german transferred him to intelligence duties and sent him on a training course training was all the army had done so far no british forces had yet fought the enemy in an engagement of any significance germany and the ussr had overrun poland and divided it between them and the allied guarantee of polish independence had proved worthless british people called it the phoney war and they were impatient for the real thing lloyd had no sentimental illusions about warfare he had heard the piteous voices of dying men begging for water on the battlefields of spain but even so he was eager to get started on the final showdown with fascism the army was expecting to send more forces to france assuming the germans would invade it had not happened and they remained at the ready but meanwhile they did a lot of training lloyds initiation into the mysteries of military intelligence was to take place in the stately home that had featured in his familys destiny for so long the wealthy and noble owners of many such palaces had loaned them to the armed forces perhaps for fear that otherwise they might be confiscated permanently the army had certainly made tŷ gwyn look different there were a dozen olivedrab vehicles parked on the lawn and their tyres had chewed up the earls lush turf the gracious entrance courtyard with its curved granite steps had become a supply dump and giant cans of baked beans and cooking lard stood in teetering stacks where formerly bejewelled women and men in tailcoats had stepped out of their carriages lloyd grinned he liked the levelling effect of war lloyd entered the house he was greeted by a podgy officer in a creased and stained uniform here for the intelligence course lieutenant yes sir my name is lloyd williams im major lowther lloyd had heard of him he was the marquis of lowther known to his pals as lowthie lloyd looked around the paintings on the walls had been shrouded with huge dust sheets the ornate carved marble fireplaces had been boxed in with rough planking leaving only a small space for a grate the dark old furniture that his mother sometimes mentioned fondly had all disappeared to be replaced by steel desks and cheap chairs my goodness the place looks different he said lowther smiled youve been here before do you know the family i was up at cambridge with boy fitzherbert i met the viscountess there too although they werent married then but i suppose theyve moved out for the duration not entirely a few rooms have been reserved for their private use but they dont bother us at all so you came here as a guest goodness no i dont know them well no i was shown around the place as a boy one day when the family werent in residence my mother worked here at one time really what looking after the earls library or something no as a housemaid as soon as the words were out of lloyds mouth he knew he had made a mistake lowthers face changed to an expression of distaste i see he said how very interesting lloyd knew he had instantly been pigeonholed as a proletarian upstart he would now be treated as a secondclass citizen throughout his time here he should have kept quiet about his mothers past he knew how snobbish the army was lowthie said show the lieutenant to his room sergeant attic floor lloyd had been assigned a room in the old servants quarters he did not really mind it was good enough for my mother he thought as they walked up the back stairs the sergeant told lloyd he had no obligations until dinner in the mess lloyd asked whether any of the fitzherberts happened to be in residence right now but the man did not know it took lloyd two minutes to unpack he combed his hair put on a clean uniform shirt and went to visit his grandparents the house in wellington row seemed smaller and more drab than ever though it now had hot water in the scullery and a flushing toilet in the outhouse the decor had not altered within lloyds memory same rag rug on the floor same faded paisley curtains same hard oak chairs in the single groundfloor room that served as living room and kitchen his grandparents had changed though both were about seventy now he guessed and looking frail granda had pains in his legs and had reluctantly retired from his job with the miners union grandmam had a weak heart dr mortimer had told her to put her feet up for a quarter of an hour after meals they were pleased to see lloyd in his uniform lieutenant is it said grandmam a class warrior all her life she nevertheless could not conceal her pride that her grandson was an officer news travelled fast in aberowen and the fact that dai unions grandson was visiting probably went halfway round the town before lloyd had finished his first cup of grandmams strong tea so he was not really surprised when tommy griffiths dropped in i expect my lenny would be a lieutenant like you if hed come back from spain tommy said i should think so lloyd said he had never met an officer who had been a coal miner in civilian life but anything might happen once the war got going properly he was the best sergeant in spain i can tell you that you two went through a lot together we went through hell lloyd said and we lost but the fascists wont win this time ill drink to that said tommy and emptied his mug of tea lloyd went with his grandparents to the evening service at the bethesda chapel religion was not a big part of his life and he certainly did not go along with grandas dogmatism the universe was mysterious lloyd thought and people might as well admit it but it pleased his grandparents that he sat with them in chapel the extempore prayers were eloquent knitting biblical phrases seamlessly into colloquial language the sermon was a bit tedious but the singing thrilled lloyd welsh chapelgoers automatically sang in fourpart harmony and when they were in the mood they could raise the roof as he joined in lloyd felt this was the beating heart of britain here in this whitewashed chapel the people around him were poorly dressed and illeducated and they lived lives of unending hard work the men winning the coal underground the women raising the next generation of miners but they had strong backs and sharp minds and all on their own they had created a culture that made life worth living they gained hope from nonconformist christianity and leftwing politics they found joy in rugby football and male voice choirs and they were bonded together by generosity in good times and solidarity in bad this was what he would be fighting for these people this town and if he had to give his life for them it would be well spent granda gave the closing prayer standing up with his eyes shut leaning on a walking stick you see among us o lord your young servant lloyd williams sitting by here in his uniform we ask you in your wisdom and grace to spare his life in the conflict to come please lord send him back home to us safe and whole if it be your will o lord the congregation gave a heartfelt amen and lloyd wiped away a tear he walked the old folk home as the sun went down behind the mountain and an evening gloom settled on the rows of grey houses he refused the offer of supper and hurried back to tŷ gwyn arriving in time for dinner in the mess they had braised beef boiled potatoes and cabbage it was no better or worse than most army food and lloyd tucked in aware that it had been paid for by people such as his grandparents who were having breadanddripping for their supper there was a bottle of whisky on the table and lloyd took some to be convivial he studied his fellow trainees and tried to remember their names on his way up to bed he passed through the sculpture room now empty of art and furnished with a blackboard and twelve cheap desks there he saw major lowther talking to a woman at a second glance he saw that the woman was daisy fitzherbert he was so surprised that he stopped lowther looked around with an irritated expression he saw lloyd and reluctantly said lady aberowen i believe you know lieutenant williams if she denies it lloyd thought i shall remind her of the time she kissed me long and hard on a mayfair street in the dark how nice to see you again mr williams she said and put out her hand to shake her skin was warm and soft to his touch his heart beat faster lowther said williams tells me his mother worked at this house as a maid i know daisy said he told me that at the trinity ball he was reproving me for being a snob im sorry to say that he was quite right youre generous lady aberowen said lloyd feeling embarrassed i dont know what business i had to say such a thing to you she seemed less brittle than he remembered perhaps she had matured daisy said to lowther mr williamss mother is a member of parliament now though lowther was taken aback lloyd said to daisy and how is your jewish friend eva i know she married jimmy murray they have two children now did she get her parents out of germany how kind of you to remember but no sadly the rothmanns cant get exit visas im so sorry it must be hell for her it is lowther was visibly impatient with this talk of housemaids and jews to get back to what i was saying lady aberowen lloyd said ill bid you goodnight he left the room and ran upstairs as he got ready for bed he found himself singing the last hymn from the service no storm can shake my inmost calm while to that rock im clinging since love is lord of heaven and earth how can i keep from singing ii three days later daisy was finishing writing to her halfbrother greg when war broke out he had sent her a sweetly anxious letter and since then they had corresponded every month or so he had told her about seeing his old flame jacky jakes on e street in washington and asked daisy what would make a girl run away like that daisy had no idea she said so and wished him luck then signed off she looked at the clock it was an hour before the trainees dinner time so lessons had ended and she had a good chance of catching lloyd in his room she went up to the old servants quarters on the attic floor the young officers were sitting or lying on their beds reading or writing she found lloyd in a narrow room with an old chevalglass sitting by the window studying an illustrated book she said reading something interesting he sprang to his feet hello this is a surprise he was blushing he probably still had a crush on her it had been very cruel of her to kiss him when she had no intention of letting the relationship go any further but that was four years ago and they had both been kids he should have gotten over it by now she looked at the book in his hands it was in german and had colour pictures of badges we have to know german insignia he explained a lot of military intelligence comes from interrogation of prisoners of war immediately after their capture some wont talk of course so the interrogator needs to be able to tell just by looking at the prisoners uniform what his rank is what army corps he belongs to whether he is from infantry cavalry artillery or a specialist unit such as veterinarian and so on thats what youre learning here she said sceptically the meanings of german badges he laughed its one of the things were learning one i can tell you about without giving away military secrets oh i see why are you here in wales im surprised youre not doing something for the war effort there you go again she said moral reproof did someone tell you this was a way to charm women pardon me he said stiffly i didnt mean to rebuke you anyway there is no war effort barrage balloons float in the air as a hazard to german planes that never come at least youd have a social life in london do you know that used to be the most important thing in the world and now its not she said i must be getting old there was another reason she had left london but she was not going to tell him i imagined you in a nurses uniform he said not likely i hate sick people but before you give me another of those disapproving frowns take a look at this she handed him the framed photograph she was carrying he studied it frowning where did you get it i was looking through a box of old pictures in the basement junk room it was a group photo taken on the east lawn of tŷ gwyn on a summer morning in the centre was the young earl fitzherbert with a big white dog at his feet the girl next to him was probably his sister maud whom daisy had never met lined up on either side of them were forty or fifty men and women in a variety of servants uniforms look at the date she said nineteentwelve lloyd read aloud she watched him studying his reactions to the photo he was holding is your mother in it goodness she might be lloyd looked closer i believe she is he said after a minute show me lloyd pointed i think thats her daisy saw a slim pretty girl of about nineteen with curly black hair under a maids white cap and a smile that had more than a hint of mischief in it why shes enchanting she said she was then anyway lloyd said nowadays people are more likely to call her formidable have you ever met lady maud do you think thats her next to fitz i suppose ive known her all my life off and on she and my mother were suffragettes together i havent seen her since i left berlin in but this is definitely her in the picture shes not so pretty perhaps but shes very poised and wonderfully well dressed anyway i thought you might like to have the picture to keep of course no one else wants it thats why it was in a box in the basement thank you youre welcome daisy went to the door go back to your studies going down the back stairs she hoped she had not flirted she probably should not have gone to see him at all she had succumbed to a generous impulse heaven forbid that he should misinterpret it she felt a sharp pain in her tummy and stopped on the halflanding she had had a slight backache all day which she attributed to the cheap mattress she was sleeping on but this was different she thought back over what she had eaten today but could not identify anything that might have made her ill no undercooked chicken no unripe fruit she had not eaten oysters no such luck the pain went as quickly as it had come and she told herself to forget about it she returned to her quarters in the basement she was living in what had been the housekeepers flat a tiny bedroom a sitting room a small kitchen and an adequate bathroom with a tub an old footman called morrison was acting as caretaker to the house and a young woman from aberowen was her maid the girl was called little maisie owen although she was quite big my mothers maisie too so ive always been little maisie even though im taller than her now she had explained the phone rang as daisy entered she picked it up and heard her husbands voice how are you he said im fine what time will you be here he had flown to raf st athan a large air base outside cardiff on some mission and he had promised to visit her and spend the night im not going to make it im sorry oh how disappointing theres a ceremonial dinner at the base that im required to attend he did not sound particularly dispirited that he would not see her and she felt spurned how nice for you she said it will be boring but i cant get out of it not half as boring as living here on my own it must be dull but youre better off there in your condition thousands of people had left london after war was declared but most of them had drifted back when the expected bombing raids and gas attacks did not materialize however bea and may and even eva were agreed that daisys pregnancy meant she should live at tŷ gwyn many women gave birth safely every day in london daisy had pointed out but of course the heir to the earldom was different in truth she did not mind as much as she had expected perhaps pregnancy had made her uncharacteristically passive but there was a halfhearted quality about london social life since the declaration of war as if people felt they did not have the right to enjoy themselves they were like vicars in a pub knowing it was supposed to be fun but unable to enter into the spirit i wish i had my motorcycle here though she said then at least i could explore wales petrol was rationed but not severely really daisy he said censoriously you cant ride a motorcycle the doctor absolutely forbade it anyway ive discovered literature she said the library here is wonderful a few rare and valuable editions have been packed away but nearly all the books are still on the shelves im getting the education i worked so hard to avoid at school excellent he said well curl up with a good murder mystery and enjoy your evening i had a slight tummy pain earlier probably indigestion i expect youre right give my regards to that slob lowthie dont drink too much port at your dinner just as daisy hung up she got the tummy cramp again this time it lasted longer maisie came in saw her face and said are you all right my lady just a twinge i have came to ask if you are ready for your supper i dont feel hungry i think ill skip supper tonight i done you a lovely cottage pie maisie said reproachfully cover it and put it in the larder ill eat it tomorrow shall i make you a nice cup of tea just to get rid of her daisy said yes please even after four years she had not grown to like strong british tea with milk and sugar in it the pain went away and she sat down and opened the mill on the floss she forced herself to drink maisies tea and felt a little better when she had finished the drink and maisie had washed the cup and saucer she sent maisie home the girl had to walk a mile in the dark but she carried a flashlight and said she did not mind an hour later the pain returned and this time it did not go away daisy went to the toilet vaguely hoping to relieve pressure in her abdomen she was surprised and worried to see spots of darkred blood in her underwear she put on clean panties and seriously worried now she went to the phone she got the number of raf st athan and called the base i need to speak to flight lieutenant the viscount aberowen she said we cant connect personal calls to officers said a pedantic welshman this is an emergency i must speak to my husband there are no phones in the rooms this isnt the dorchester hotel perhaps it was her imagination but he sounded quite pleased that he could not help her my husband will be at the ceremonial banquet please send an orderly to bring him to the phone i havent got any orderlies and anyway theres no banquet no banquet daisy was momentarily at a loss just the usual dinner in the mess the operator said and that was finished an hour ago daisy slammed the phone down no banquet boy had distinctly said he had to attend a ceremonial dinner at the base he must have lied she wanted to cry he had chosen not to see her preferring to go drinking with his comrades or perhaps to visit some woman the reason did not matter daisy was not his priority she took a deep breath she needed help she did not know the phone number of the aberowen doctor if there was one what was she to do last time boy had left he had said youll have a hundred or more army officers to look after you if necessary but she could not tell the marquis of lowther that she was bleeding from her vagina the pain was getting worse and she could feel something warm and sticky between her legs she went to the bathroom again and washed herself there were clots in the blood she saw she did not have any sanitary towels pregnant women did not need them she had thought she cut a length off a hand towel and stuffed it in her panties then she thought of lloyd williams he was kind he had been brought up by a strongminded feminist woman he adored daisy he would help her she went up to the hall where was he the trainees would have finished their dinner by now he might be upstairs her stomach hurt so much that she did not think she could make it all the way to the attic perhaps he was in the library the trainees used the room for quiet study she went in a sergeant was poring over an atlas would you be very kind she said to him and find lieutenant lloyd williams for me of course my lady said the man closing the book whats the message ask him if he would come down to the basement for a moment are you all right maam you look a bit pale ill be fine just fetch williams as quickly as you can right away daisy returned to her rooms the effort of seeming normal had exhausted her and she lay on the bed before long she felt the blood soaking through her dress but she hurt too much to care she looked at her watch why had lloyd not come perhaps the sergeant could not find him it was such a big house perhaps she would just die here there was a tap at the door and then to her immense relief she heard his voice its lloyd williams come in she called he was going to see her in a dreadful state perhaps it would put him off her for good she heard him enter the next room it took me a while to find your quarters he said where are you through here he stepped into the bedroom good god he exclaimed what on earth has happened get help she said is there a doctor in this town of course dr mortimer hes been here for centuries but there may not be time let me he hesitated you may be haemorrhaging but i cant tell unless i look she closed her eyes go ahead she was almost too scared to be embarrassed she felt him raise the skirt of her dress oh dear he said poor you then he ripped her underpants im sorry he said is there some water bathroom she said pointing he stepped into the bathroom and ran a tap a moment later she felt a warm damp cloth being used to clean her then he said its just a trickle ive seen men bleed to death and youre not in that danger she opened her eyes to see him pulling her skirt back down wheres the phone he said sitting room she heard him say put me through to dr mortimer quick as you can there was a pause this is lloyd williams im at tŷ gwyn may i speak to the doctor oh hello mrs mortimer when do you expect him back its a woman with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding yes i do realize most women suffer that every month but this is clearly abnormal shes twentythree yes married no children ill ask he raised his voice could you be pregnant yes daisy replied three months he repeated her answer then there was a long silence eventually he hung up the phone and returned to her he sat on the edge of the bed the doctor will come as soon as he can but hes operating on a miner crushed by a runaway dram however his wife is quite sure that youve suffered a miscarriage he took her hand im sorry daisy thank you she whispered the pain seemed less but she felt terribly sad the heir to the earldom was no more boy would be so upset lloyd said mrs mortimer says its quite common and most women suffer one or two miscarriages between pregnancies theres no danger provided the bleeding isnt copious what if it gets worse then i must drive you to merthyr hospital but going ten miles in an army lorry would be quite bad for you so its to be avoided unless your life is in danger she was not frightened any more im so glad you were here may i make a suggestion of course do you think you can walk a few steps i dont know let me run you a bath if you can manage it youll feel so much better when youre clean yes then perhaps you can improvise a bandage of some kind yes he returned to the bathroom and she heard water running she sat upright she felt dizzy and rested for a minute then her head cleared she swung her feet to the floor she was sitting in congealing blood and felt disgusted with herself the taps were turned off he came back in and took her arm if you feel faint just tell me he said i wont let you fall he was surprisingly strong and half carried her as he walked her into the bathroom at some point her ripped underwear fell to the floor she stood beside the bath and let him undo the buttons at the back of her dress can you manage the rest he said she nodded and he went out leaning on the linen basket she took off her clothes slowly leaving them on the floor in a bloodstained heap gingerly she got into the bath the water was just hot enough the pain eased as she lay back and relaxed she felt overwhelmed with gratitude to lloyd he was so kind that it made her want to cry after a few minutes the door opened a crack and his hand appeared holding some clothes a nightdress and so on he said he placed them on top of the linen basket and closed the door when the water began to cool she stood up she felt dizzy again but only for a moment she dried herself with a towel then put on the nightdress and underwear he had brought she placed a hand towel inside her panties to soak up the blood that continued to seep when she returned to the bedroom her bed was made up with clean sheets and blankets she climbed in and sat upright pulling the covers up to her neck he came in from the sitting room you must be feeling better he said you look embarrassed embarrassed isnt the word she said mortified perhaps though even that seems understated the truth was not so simple she winced when she thought of how he had seen her but on the other hand he had not seemed disgusted he went into the bathroom and picked up her discarded clothes apparently he was not squeamish about menstrual blood she said where have you put the sheets i found a big sink in the flower room i left them to soak in cold water ill do the same with your clothes shall i she nodded he disappeared again where had he learned to be so competent and selfsufficient in the spanish civil war she supposed she heard him moving around the kitchen he reappeared with two cups of tea you probably hate this stuff but it will make you feel better she took the tea he showed her two white pills in the palm of his hand aspirin may ease the stomach cramps a bit she took them and swallowed them with hot tea he had always struck her as being mature beyond his years she remembered how confidently he had gone off to find the drunken boy at the gaiety theatre youve always been like this she said a real grownup when the rest of us were just pretending she finished the tea and felt sleepy he took the cups away i may just close my eyes for a moment she said will you stay here if i go to sleep ill stay as long as you like he said then he said something else but his voice seemed to fade away and she slept iii after that lloyd began to spend his evenings in the little housekeepers flat he looked forward to it all day he would go downstairs a few minutes after eight when dinner in the mess was over and daisys maid had left for the night they would sit opposite one another in the two old armchairs lloyd would bring a book to study there was always homework with tests in the morning and daisy would read a novel but mostly they talked they related what had happened during the day discussed whatever they were reading and told each other the story of their lives he recounted his experiences at the battle of cable street standing there in a peaceful crowd we were charged by mounted policemen screaming about dirty jews he told her they beat us with their truncheons and pushed us through the plateglass windows she had been quarantined with the fascists in tower gardens and had seen none of the fighting that wasnt the way it was reported she said she had believed the newspapers that said it had been a street riot organized by hooligans lloyd was not surprised my mother watched the newsreel at the aldgate essoldo a week later he recalled that plummyvoiced commentator said from impartial observers the police received nothing but praise mam said the entire audience burst out laughing daisy was shocked by his scepticism about the news he told her that most british papers had suppressed stories of atrocities by francos army in spain and exaggerated any report of bad behaviour by government forces she admitted she had swallowed earl fitzherberts view that the rebels were highminded christians liberating spain from the threat of communism she knew nothing of mass executions rape and looting by francos men it seemed never to have occurred to her that newspapers owned by capitalists might play down news that reflected badly on the conservative government the military or businessmen and would seize upon any incident of bad behaviour by trade unionists or leftwing parties lloyd and daisy talked about the war there was action at last british and french troops had landed in norway and were contending for control with the germans who had done the same the newspapers could not quite conceal the fact that it was going badly for the allies her attitude to him had changed she no longer flirted she was always pleased to see him and complained if he was late arriving in the evening and she teased him sometimes but she was never coquettish she told him how disappointed everyone was about the baby she had lost boy fitz bea her mother in buffalo even her father lev she could not shake the irrational feeling that she had done something shameful and she asked if he thought that was foolish he did not nothing she did was foolish to him their conversation was personal but they kept their distance from one another physically he would not exploit the extraordinary intimacy of the night she miscarried of course the scene would live in his heart for ever wiping the blood from her thighs and her belly had not been sexy not in the least but it had been unbearably tender however it had been a medical emergency and it did not give him permission to take liberties later he was so afraid of giving the wrong impression about this that he was careful never to touch her at ten oclock she would make them cocoa which he loved and she said she liked though he wondered if she was just being nice then he would say goodnight and go upstairs to his attic bedroom they were like old friends it was not what he wanted but she was a married woman and this was the best he was going to get he tended to forget daisys status he was startled one evening when she announced that she was going to pay a visit to the earls retired butler peel who was living in a cottage just outside the grounds hes eighty she told lloyd im sure fitz has forgotten all about him i should check on him lloyd raised his eyebrows in surprise and she added i need to make sure hes all right its my duty as a member of the fitzherbert clan taking care of your old retainers is an obligation of wealthy families didnt you know that it had slipped my mind will you come with me of course the next day was a sunday and they went in the morning when lloyd had no lectures they were both shocked by the state of the little house the paint was flaking the wallpaper was peeling and the curtains were grey with coal dust the only decoration was a row of photographs cut from magazines and tacked to the wall the king and queen fitz and bea and other assorted members of the nobility the place had not been properly cleaned for years and there was a smell of urine and ash and decay but lloyd guessed it was not unusual for an old man on a small pension peel had white eyebrows he looked at lloyd and said good morning my lord i thought you were dead lloyd smiled im just a visitor are you sir my poor brain is scrambled eggs the old earl died what thirtyfive or forty years ago well then who are you young sir im lloyd williams you knew my mother ethel years ago youre eths boy well in that case of course daisy said in that case what mr peel oh nothing my brains scrambled eggs they asked him if he needed anything and he insisted he had everything a man could want i dont eat much and i rarely drink beer ive got enough money to buy pipe tobacco and the newspaper will hitler invade us do you think young lloyd i hope i dont live to see that daisy cleaned up his kitchen a bit though housekeeping was not her forte i cant believe it she said to lloyd in a low voice living here like this he says hes got everything he thinks hes lucky many men his age are worse off lloyd said they talked to peel for an hour before they left he thought of something he did want he looked at the row of pictures on the wall at the funeral of the old earl there was a photograph took he said i was a mere footman then not the butler we all lined up alongside the hearse there was a big old camera with a black cloth over it not like the little modern ones that was in i bet i know where that photograph is said daisy well go and look they returned to the big house and went down to the basement the junk room next to the wine cellar was quite large it was full of boxes and chests and useless ornaments a ship in a bottle a model of tŷ gwyn made of matchsticks a miniature chest of drawers a sword in an ornate scabbard they began to sort through old photographs and paintings the dust made daisy sneeze but she insisted on continuing they found the photograph peel wanted in the box with it was an even older photo of the previous earl lloyd stared at it in some astonishment the sepia picture was five inches high and three inches wide and showed a young man in the uniform of a victorian army officer he looked exactly like lloyd look at this he said handing the photo to daisy it could be you if you had sidewhiskers she said perhaps the old earl had a romance with one of my ancestors lloyd said flippantly if she was a married woman she might have passed off the earls child as her husbands i wouldnt be very pleased i can tell you to learn that i was illegitimately descended from the aristocracy a redhot socialist like me daisy said lloyd how stupid are you he could not tell whether she was serious besides she had a smear of dust on her nose that looked so sweet that he longed to kiss it well he said ive made a fool of myself more than once but listen to me your mother was a maid in this house suddenly in she went to london and married a man called teddy whom no one knows anything about except that his surname was williams the same as hers so she did not have to change her name the mysterious mr williams died before anyone met him and his life insurance bought her the house she still lives in exactly he said what are you getting at then after mr williams died she gave birth to a son who happens to look remarkably like the late earl fitzherbert he began to get a glimmer of what she might be saying go on has it never occurred to you that there might be a completely different explanation for this whole story not until now what does an aristocratic family do when one of their daughters gets pregnant it happens all the time you know i suppose it does but i dont know how they handle it you never hear about it exactly the girl disappears for a few months to scotland or brittany or geneva with her maid when the two of them reappear the maid has a little baby which she says she gave birth to during the holiday the family treat her surprisingly kindly even though she has admitted fornication and send her to live a safe distance away with a small pension it seemed like a fairy story nothing to do with real life but all the same lloyd was intrigued and troubled and you think i was the baby in some such pretence i think lady maud fitzherbert had a love affair with a gardener or a coal miner or perhaps a charming rogue in london and she got pregnant she went away somewhere to give birth in secret your mother agreed to pretend the baby was hers and in exchange she was given a house lloyd was struck by a corroborating thought shes always been evasive whenever ive asked about my real father that now seemed suspicious there you are there never was a teddy williams to maintain her respectability your mother said she was a widow she called her fictional late husband williams to avoid the problem of changing her name lloyd shook his head in disbelief it seems too fantastic she and maud continued friends and maud helped raise you in your mother took you to berlin because your real mother wanted to see you again lloyd felt as if he were either dreaming or just waking up you think im mauds child he said incredulously daisy tapped the frame of the picture she was still holding and you look just like your grandfather lloyd was bewildered it could not be true yet it made sense im used to bernie not being my real father he said is ethel not my real mother daisy must have seen a look of helplessness on his face for she leaned forward and touched him something she did not generally do and said im sorry have i been brutal i just want you to see whats in front of your eyes if peel suspects the truth dont you think others may too its the kind of news you want to hear from someone who from a friend a gong sounded distantly lloyd said mechanically id better go to the mess for lunch he took the photograph out of its frame and slipped it into a pocket of his uniform jacket youre upset daisy said anxiously no no just astonished men always deny that theyre upset please come and see me later all right dont go to bed without talking to me again i wont he left the junk room and made his way upstairs to the grand dining room now the mess he ate his canned beef mince automatically his mind in turmoil he took no part in the discussion at table about the battle raging in norway having a daydream williams said major lowther sorry sir lloyd said mechanically he improvised an excuse i was trying to remember which was the higher german rank generalleutnant or generalmajor lowther said generalleutnant is higher then he added quietly just dont forget the difference between meine frau and deine frau lloyd felt himself blush so his friendship with daisy was not as discreet as he had imagined it had even come to lowthers notice he felt indignant he and daisy had done nothing improper yet he did not protest he felt guilty even though he was not he could not put his hand on his heart and swear that his intentions were pure he knew what granda would say whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart that was the nobullshit teaching of jesus and there was a lot of truth in it thinking of his grandparents led him to wonder if they knew about his real parents being in doubt about his real father and mother gave him a lost feeling like a dream about falling from a height if he had been told lies about that he might have been misled about anything he decided he would question granda and grandmam he could do it today as it was sunday as soon as he could decently excuse himself from the mess he walked downhill to wellington row it occurred to him that if he asked them outright whether he was mauds son they might simply deny everything pointblank perhaps a more gradual approach would be more likely to elicit information he found them sitting in their kitchen to them sunday was the lords day devoted to religion and they would not read newspapers or listen to the radio but they were pleased to see him and grandmam made tea as always lloyd began i wish i knew more about my real father mam says that teddy williams was in the welsh rifles did you know that grandmam said oh why do you want to go digging up the past bernies your father lloyd did not contradict her bernie leckwith has been everything a father should be to me granda nodded a jew but a good man theres no doubt he imagined he was being magnanimously tolerant lloyd let it pass all the same im curious did you meet teddy williams granda looked angry no he said and it was a sorrow to us grandmam said he came to tŷ gwyn as a valet to a guest we never knew your mother was sweet on him till she went to london to marry him why didnt you go to the wedding they were both silent then granda said tell him the truth cara no good ever comes of lies your mother yielded to temptation grandmam said after the valet left tŷ gwyn she found she was with child lloyd had suspected that and thought it might account for her evasiveness your granda was very angry grandmam added too angry granda said i forgot that jesus said judge not that ye be not judged her sin was lust but mine was pride lloyd was astonished to see tears in his grandfathers paleblue eyes god forgave her but i didnt not for a long time by then my soninlaw was dead killed in france lloyd was more bewildered than before here was another detailed story somewhat different from what he had been told by his mother and completely different from daisys theory was granda weeping for a soninlaw who had never existed he persisted and the family of teddy williams mam said he came from swansea he probably had parents brothers and sisters grandmam said your mother never talked about his family i think she was ashamed whatever the reason she didnt want to know them and it wasnt our place to go against her in that but i might have two more grandparents in swansea and uncles and aunts and cousins ive never met aye said granda but we dont know my mother knows though i suppose she does ill ask her then said lloyd iv daisy was in love she knew now that she had never loved anyone before lloyd she had never truly loved boy though she had been excited by him as for poor charlie farquharson she had been at most fond of him she had believed that love was something she could bestow upon whomever she liked and that her main responsibility was to choose cleverly now she knew that was all wrong cleverness had nothing to do with it and she had no choice love was an earthquake life was empty but for the two hours she spent with lloyd each evening the rest of the day was anticipation the night was recollection lloyd was the pillow she put her cheek on he was the towel with which she patted her breasts when she got out of the bathtub he was the knuckle she put into her mouth and sucked thoughtfully how could she have ignored him for four years the love of her life had appeared before her at the trinity ball and she had noticed only that he appeared to be wearing someone elses dress clothes why had she not taken him in her arms and kissed him and insisted they get married immediately he had known all along she surmised he must have fallen in love with her from the start he had begged her to throw boy over give him up he had said the night they went to the gaiety music hall be my girlfriend instead and she had laughed at him but he had seen the truth to which she had been blind however some intuition deep within her had told her to kiss him there on the mayfair pavement in the darkness between two street lights at the time she had regarded it as a selfindulgent whim but in fact it was the smartest thing she had ever done for it had probably sealed his devotion now at tŷ gwyn she refused to think about what would happen next she was living from day to day walking on air smiling at nothing she got an anxious letter from her mother in buffalo worrying about her health and her state of mind after the miscarriage and she sent back a reassuring reply olga included titbits of news dave rouzrokh had died in palm beach muffie dixon had married philip renshaw senator dewars wife rosa had written a bestseller called behind the scenes at the white house with photographs by woody a month ago this would have made her homesick now she was just mildly interested she felt sad only when she thought of the baby she had lost the pain had gone immediately and the bleeding had stopped after a week but the loss grieved her she no longer cried about it but occasionally she found herself staring into empty space thinking about whether it would have been a girl or a boy and what it would have looked like and then realized with a shock that she had not moved for an hour spring had come and she walked on the windy mountainside in waterproof boots and a raincoat sometimes when she was sure there was no one to hear but the sheep she shouted at the top of her voice i love him she worried about his reaction to her questions about his parentage perhaps she had done wrong to raise the issue it had only made him unhappy yet her excuse had been valid sooner or later the truth would probably come out and it was better to hear such things from someone who loved you his pained bafflement touched her heart and made her love him even more then he told her he had arranged leave he was going to a south coast resort called bournemouth for the labour partys annual conference on the second weekend in may which was a british holiday called whitsun his mother would also be at bournemouth he said so he would have a chance to question her about his parentage and daisy thought he looked eager and afraid at the same time lowther would certainly have refused to let him go but lloyd had spoken to colonel ellisjones back in march when he had been assigned to this course and the colonel either liked lloyd or sympathized with the party or both and gave him permission which lowther could not countermand of course if the germans invaded france then nobody would be able to take leave daisy was strangely frightened by the prospect of lloyds leaving aberowen without knowing that she loved him she was not sure why but she had to tell him before he went lloyd was to leave on wednesday and return six days later by coincidence boy had announced he would come to visit arriving on wednesday evening daisy was glad for reasons she could not quite figure out that the two men would not be there at the same time she decided to make her confession to lloyd on tuesday the day before he left she had no idea what she was going to say to her husband a day later imagining the conversation she would have with lloyd she realized that he would surely kiss her and when they kissed they would be overwhelmed by their feelings and they would make love and then they would lie all night in each others arms at this point in her thinking the need for discretion intruded into her daydream lloyd must not be seen emerging from her quarters in the morning for both their sakes lowthie already had his suspicions she could tell by his attitude towards her which was both disapproving and roguish almost as if he felt that he rather than lloyd should be the one she should fall for how much better it would be if she and lloyd could meet somewhere else for their fateful conversation she thought of the unused bedrooms in the west wing and she felt breathless he could leave at dawn and if anyone saw him they would not know he had been with her she could emerge later fully dressed and pretend to be looking for some lost piece of family property a painting perhaps in fact she thought elaborating on the lie she would tell if necessary she could take some object from the junk room and place it in the bedroom in advance ready to be used as concrete evidence of her story at nine oclock on tuesday when the students were all in classes she walked along the upper floor carrying a set of perfume vials with tarnished silver tops and a matching hand mirror she felt guilty already the carpet had been taken up and her footsteps rang loud on the floorboards as if announcing the approach of a scarlet woman fortunately there was no one in the bedrooms she went to the gardenia suite which she vaguely thought was being used for storage of bed linen there was no one in the corridor as she stepped inside she closed the door quickly behind her she was panting i havent done anything yet she told herself she had remembered aright all around the room piled up against the gardeniaprinted wallpaper were neat stacks of sheets and blankets and pillows wrapped in covers of coarse cotton and tied with string like large parcels the room smelled musty and she opened a window the original furniture was still here a bed a wardrobe a chest of drawers a writing table and a kidneyshaped dressing table with three mirrors she put the perfume vials on the dressing table then she made the bed up with some of the stored linen the sheets were cold to her touch now ive done something she thought ive made a bed for my lover and me she looked at the white pillows and the pink blankets with their satin edging and she saw herself and lloyd locked in a clinging embrace kissing with mad desperation the thought aroused her so much that she felt faint she heard footsteps outside ringing on the floorboards as hers had who could that be morrison perhaps the old footman on his way to look at a leaking gutter or a cracked windowpane she waited heart pounding with guilt as the footsteps came nearer then receded the scare calmed her excitement and cooled the heat she felt inside she took one last look around the scene and left there was no one in the corridor she walked along her shoes heralding her progress but she looked perfectly innocent now she told herself she could go anywhere she wanted she had more right to be here than anyone else she was at home her husband was heir to the whole place the husband she was carefully planning to betray she knew she should be paralysed by guilt but in fact she was eager to do it consumed by longing next she had to brief lloyd he had come to her apartment last night as usual but she could not have made this assignation with him then for he would have expected her to explain herself and then she knew she would have told him everything and taken him to her bed and ruined the whole plan so she had to speak to him briefly today she did not normally see him in the daytime unless she ran into him by accident in the hall or library how could she make sure of meeting him she went up the back stairs to the attic floor the trainees were not in their rooms but at any moment one of them might appear returning to his room for something he had forgotten so she had to be quick she went into lloyds room it smelled of him she could not say exactly what the fragrance was she did not see a bottle of cologne in the room but there was a jar of some kind of hair lotion beside his razor she opened it and sniffed yes that was it citrus and spice was he vain she asked herself perhaps a little bit he usually looked well dressed even in his uniform she would leave him a note on top of the dresser was a pad of cheap writing paper she opened it and tore out a sheet she looked around for something to write with he had a black fountain pen with his name engraved on the barrel she knew but he would have that with him for writing notes in class she found a pencil in the top drawer what could she write she had to be careful in case someone else should read the note in the end she just wrote library she left the pad open on the dresser where he could hardly fail to see it then she left no one saw her he would probably come to his room at some point she speculated perhaps to fill his pen with ink from the bottle on the dresser then he would see the note and come to her she went to the library to wait the morning was long she was reading victorian authors they seemed to understand how she felt right now but today mrs gaskell could not hold her attention and she spent most of the time looking out of the window it was may and normally there would have been a brilliant display of spring flowers in the grounds of tŷ gwyn but most of the gardeners had joined the armed forces and the rest were growing vegetables not flowers several trainees came into the library just before eleven and settled down in the green leather chairs with their notebooks but lloyd was not among them the last lecture of the morning ended at half past twelve she knew at that point the men got up and left the library but lloyd did not appear surely he would go to his room now she thought just to put down his books and wash his hands in the nearby bathroom the minutes passed and the gong sounded for lunch then he came in and her heart leaped he looked worried i just saw your note he said are you all right his first concern was for her a problem of hers was not a nuisance to him but an opportunity to help her and he would seize it eagerly no man had cared for her this way not even her father everything is all right she said do you know what a gardenia looks like she had rehearsed this speech all morning i suppose so a bit like a rose why in the west wing theres an apartment called the gardenia suite it has a white gardenia painted on the door and its full of stored linen do you think you could find it of course meet me there tonight instead of coming to the flat usual time he stared at her trying to figure out what was going on i will he said but why i want to tell you something how exciting he said but he looked puzzled she could guess what was going through his mind he was electrified by the thought that she might intend a romantic assignation and at the same time he was telling himself that was a hopeless dream go to lunch she said he hesitated she said ill see you tonight i cant wait he said and went out she returned to her flat maisie who was not much of a cook had made her a sandwich with two slabs of bread and a slice of canned ham daisys stomach was full of butterflies she could not have eaten if it had been peach ice cream she lay down to rest her thoughts about the night to come were so explicit she felt embarrassed she had learned a lot about sex from boy who clearly had much experience with other women and she knew a great deal about what men liked she wanted to do everything with lloyd to kiss every part of his body to do what boy called soixanteneuf to swallow his semen the thoughts were so arousing that it took all her willpower to resist the temptation to pleasure herself she had a cup of coffee at five then washed her hair and took a long bath shaving her underarms and trimming her pubic hair which grew too abundantly she dried herself and rubbed in a light body lotion all over she perfumed herself and began to get dressed she put on new underwear she tried on all her dresses she liked the look of one with fine blueandwhite stripes but all down the front it had little buttons that would take forever to undo and she knew she would want to undress quickly im thinking like a whore she realized and she did not know whether to be amused or ashamed in the end she decided on a simple peppermintgreen cashmere kneelength that showed off her shapely legs she studied herself in the narrow mirror on the inside of the wardrobe door she looked good she perched on the edge of the bed to put her stockings on and boy came in daisy felt faint if she had not been sitting she would have fallen down she stared at him in disbelief surprise he said with jollity i came a day early yes she said when at last she was able to speak surprise he bent down and kissed her she had never much liked his tongue in her mouth because he always tasted of booze and cigars he did not mind her distaste in fact he seemed to enjoy forcing the issue but now out of guilt she tongued him back gosh he said when he ran out of breath youre frisky you have no idea daisy thought at least i hope you dont the exercise was brought forward by a day he explained no time to warn you so youre here for the night she said yes and lloyd was leaving in the morning you dont seem very pleased boy said he looked at her dress did you have something else planned such as what she said she had to regain her composure a night out at the two crowns pub perhaps she asked sarcastically speaking of that lets have a drink he left the room in search of booze daisy buried her face in her hands how could this be her plan was ruined she would have to find some way of alerting lloyd and she could not declare her love for him in a hurried whisper with boy around the corner she told herself that the whole scheme would simply be postponed it was only for a few days he was due back next tuesday the delay would be agonizing but she would survive and so would her love all the same she almost cried with disappointment she finished putting on her stockings and shoes then she went into the little sitting room boy had found a bottle of scotch and two glasses she took some to be convivial he said i see that girl is making a fish pie for supper im starving is she a good cook not really her food is edible if youre hungry oh well theres always whisky he said and he poured himself another drink what have you been doing she was desperate to get him to talk so that she would not have to did you fly to norway the germans were winning the first land battle of the war there no thank god its a disaster theres a big debate in the house of commons tonight he began to talk about the mistakes the british and french commanders had made when supper was ready boy went down to the cellar to get some wine daisy saw a chance to alert lloyd but where would he be she looked at her wristwatch it was half past seven he would be having dinner in the mess she could not walk into that room and whisper in his ear as he sat at the table with his fellow officers it would be as good as telling everyone they were lovers was there some way she could get him out of there she racked her brains but before she could think of anything boy returned triumphantly carrying a bottle of dom pérignon the first vintage they made he said historic they sat at the table and ate maisies fish pie daisy drank a glass of the champagne but she found it difficult to eat she pushed her food around the plate in an attempt to look normal boy had a second helping for dessert maisie served canned peaches with condensed milk war has been bad for british cuisine boy said not that it was great before daisy commented still working on seeming normal by now lloyd must be in the gardenia suite what would he do if she were unable to get a message to him would he remain there all night waiting and hoping for her to arrive would he give up at midnight and return to his own bed or would he come down here looking for her that might be awkward boy took out a large cigar and smoked it with satisfaction occasionally dipping the unlit end into a glass of brandy daisy tried to think of an excuse to leave him and go upstairs but nothing came what pretext could she possibly cite for visiting the trainees quarters at this time of night she still had done nothing when he put out his cigar and said well time for bed do you want to use the bathroom first not knowing what else to do she got up and went into the bedroom slowly she took off the clothes she had put on so carefully for lloyd she washed her face and put on her least alluring nightdress then she got into bed boy was moderately drunk when he climbed in beside her but he still wanted sex the thought appalled her im sorry she said dr mortimer said no marital relations for three months this was not true mortimer had said it would be all right when the bleeding stopped she felt horribly dishonest she had been planning to do it with lloyd tonight what boy said indignantly why improvising she said if we do it too soon it might affect my chances of getting pregnant again apparently that convinced him he was desperate for an heir ah well he said and turned away in a minute he was asleep daisy lay awake her mind buzzing could she slip away now she would have to get dressed she certainly could not walk around the house in her nightdress boy slept heavily but often woke to go to the bathroom what if he did that while she was gone and saw her return with her clothes on what story could she tell that had a chance of being believed everyone knew there was only one reason why a woman went creeping around a country house at night lloyd would have to suffer and she suffered with him thinking of him alone and disappointed in that musty room would he lie down in his uniform and fall asleep he would be cold unless he pulled a blanket around him would he assume some emergency or just think she had carelessly stood him up perhaps he would feel let down and be angry with her tears rolled down her face boy was snoring so he would never know she dozed off in the small hours and dreamed she was catching a train but silly things kept happening to delay her the taxi took her to the wrong place she had to walk unexpectedly far with her suitcase she could not find her ticket and when she reached the platform she found waiting for her an oldfashioned stage coach that would take days to get to london when she woke from the dream boy was in the bathroom shaving she lost heart she got up and dressed maisie prepared breakfast and boy had eggs and bacon and buttered toast by the time they had finished it was nine oclock lloyd had said he was leaving at nine he might be in the hall now with his suitcase in his hand boy got up from the table and went into the bathroom taking the newspaper with him daisy knew his morning habits he would be there five or ten minutes suddenly her apathy left her she went out of the flat and ran up the stairs to the hall lloyd was not there he must already have left her heart sank but he would be walking to the railway station only the wealthy and infirm took taxis to go a mile perhaps she could catch him up she went out through the front door she saw him four hundred yards down the drive walking smartly carrying his case and her heart leaped throwing caution to the wind she ran after him a light army pickup truck of the kind they called a tilly was bowling down the drive ahead of her to her dismay it slowed alongside lloyd no daisy said but lloyd was too far away to hear her he threw his suitcase into the back and jumped into the cab beside the driver she kept running but it was hopeless the little truck pulled away and picked up speed daisy stopped she stood and watched as the tilly passed through the gates of tŷ gwyn and disappeared from view she tried not to cry after a moment she turned around and went back inside the house v on the way to bournemouth lloyd spent a night in london and that evening wednesday may he was in the visitors gallery of the house of commons watching the debate that would decide the fate of the prime minister neville chamberlain it was like being in the gods at the theatre the seats were cramped and hard and you looked vertiginously down on the drama unfolding below the gallery was full tonight lloyd and his stepfather bernie had got tickets only with difficulty through the influence of his mother ethel who was now sitting with his uncle billy among the labour mps down in the packed chamber lloyd had had no chance yet to ask about his real father and mother everyone was too preoccupied with the political crisis both lloyd and bernie wanted chamberlain to resign the appeaser of fascism had little credibility as a war leader and the debacle in norway only underlined that the debate had begun the night before chamberlain had been furiously attacked not just by labour mps but by his own side ethel had reported the conservative leo amery had quoted cromwell at him you have sat too long here for any good you have been doing depart i say and let us have done with you in the name of god go it was a cruel speech to come from a colleague and it was made more wounding by the chorus of hear hear that arose from both sides of the chamber lloyds mother and the other female mps had got together in their own room in the palace of westminster and agreed to force a vote the men could not stop them and so joined them instead when this was announced on wednesday the debate was transformed into a ballot on chamberlain the prime minister accepted the challenge and in what lloyd felt was a sign of weakness appealed to his friends to stand by him the attacks continued tonight lloyd relished them he hated chamberlain for his policy on spain for two years from to chamberlain had continued to enforce nonintervention by britain and france while germany and italy poured arms and men into the rebel army and american ultraconservatives sold oil and trucks to franco if any one british politician bore guilt for the mass murders now being carried out by franco it was neville chamberlain and yet said bernie to lloyd during a lull chamberlain isnt really to blame for the fiasco in norway winston churchill is first lord of the admiralty and your mother says he was the one who pushed for this invasion after all chamberlain has done spain austria czechoslovakia it will be ironic if he falls from power because of something that isnt really his fault everything is ultimately the prime ministers fault said lloyd thats what it means to be the leader bernie smiled wryly and lloyd knew he was thinking that young people saw everything too simply but to his credit bernie did not say it it was a noisy debate but the house went quiet when the former prime minister david lloyd george stood up lloyd had been named after him seventyseven years old now a whitehaired elder statesman he spoke with the authority of the man who had won the great war he was merciless it is not a question of who are the prime ministers friends he said stating the obvious with withering sarcasm it is a far bigger issue once again lloyd was heartened to see that the chorus of approval came from the conservative side as well as the opposition he has appealed for sacrifices lloyd george said his nasal north wales accent seeming to sharpen the edge of his contempt there is nothing which can contribute more to victory in this war than that he should sacrifice the seals of office the opposition shouted their approval and lloyd could see his mother cheering churchill closed the debate as a speaker he was the equal of lloyd george and lloyd feared that his oratory might rescue chamberlain but the house was against him interrupting and jeering sometimes so loudly that he could not be heard over the clamour he sat down at pm and the vote was taken the voting system was cumbersome instead of raising their hands or ticking slips of paper mps had to leave the chamber and be counted as they walked through one of two lobbies for ayes or noes the process took fifteen or twenty minutes it could have been devised only by men who did not have enough to do ethel said she felt sure it would be modernized soon lloyd waited on tenterhooks the fall of chamberlain would give him profound satisfaction but it was by no means certain to distract himself he thought about daisy always a pleasant occupation how strange his last twentyfour hours at tŷ gwyn had been first the oneword note library then the rushed conversation with her tantalizing summons to the gardenia suite then a whole night of waiting cold and bored and bewildered for a woman who did not show up he had stayed there until six oclock in the morning miserable but unwilling to give up hope until the moment when he was obliged to wash and shave and change his clothes and pack his suitcase for the trip clearly something had gone wrong or she had changed her mind but what had she intended in the first place she had said she wanted to tell him something had she planned to say something earthshaking to merit all that drama or something so trivial that she had forgotten all about it and the rendezvous he would have to wait until next tuesday to ask her he had not told his family that daisy had been at tŷ gwyn that would have required him to explain to them what his relationship with daisy was now and he could not do that for he did not really understand it himself was he in love with a married woman he did not know how did she feel about him he did not know most likely he thought daisy and he were two good friends who had missed their chance at love and somehow he did not want to admit that to anyone for it seemed unbearably final he said to bernie who will take over if chamberlain goes the betting is on halifax lord halifax was currently the foreign secretary no said lloyd indignantly we cant have an earl for prime minister at a time like this anyway hes an appeaser just as bad as chamberlain i agree said bernie but who else is there what about churchill you know what stanley baldwin said about churchill baldwin a conservative had been prime minister before chamberlain when winston was born lots of fairies swooped down on his cradle with gifts imagination eloquence industry ability and then came a fairy who said no person has a right to so many gifts picked him up and gave him such a shake and a twist that he was denied judgement and wisdom lloyd smiled very witty but is it true theres something in it in the last war he was responsible for the dardanelles campaign which was a terrible defeat for us now hes pushed us into the norwegian adventure another failure hes a fine orator but the evidence suggests he has a tendency to wishful thinking lloyd said he was right about the need to rearm in the thirties when everyone else was against it including the labour party churchill will be calling for rearmament in paradise when the lion lies down with the lamb i think we need someone with an aggressive streak we want a prime minister who will bark not whimper well you may get your wish the tellers are coming back the votes were announced the ayes had the noes chamberlain had won there was uproar in the chamber the prime ministers supporters cheered but others yelled at him to resign lloyd was bitterly disappointed how can they want to keep him after all that dont jump to conclusions said bernie as the prime minister left and the noise subsided bernie was making calculations with a pencil in the margin of the evening news the government usually has a majority of about two hundred and forty thats dropped to eighty he scribbled numbers adding and subtracting taking a rough guess at the number of mps absent i reckon about forty of the governments supporters voted against chamberlain and another sixty abstained thats a terrible blow to a prime minister a hundred of his colleagues dont have confidence in him but is it enough to force him to resign lloyd said impatiently bernie spread his arms in a gesture of surrender i dont know he said vi next day lloyd ethel bernie and billy went to bournemouth by train the carriage was full of delegates from all over britain they all spent the entire journey discussing last nights debate and the future of the prime minister in accents ranging from the harsh chop of glasgow to the swerve and swoop of cockney once again lloyd had no chance to raise with his mother the subject that was haunting him like most delegates they could not afford the swanky hotels on the clifftops so they stayed in a boarding house on the outskirts that evening the four of them went to a pub and sat in a quiet corner and lloyd saw his chance bernie bought a round of drinks ethel wondered aloud what was happening to her friend maud in berlin she no longer got news for the war had ended the postal service between germany and britain lloyd sipped his pint of beer then said firmly id like to know more about my real father ethel said sharply bernie is your father evasion again lloyd suppressed the anger that immediately rose in him you dont need to tell me that he said and i dont need to tell bernie that i love him like a father because he already knows bernie patted him on the shoulder an awkward but genuine gesture of affection lloyd made his voice insistent but im curious about teddy williams billy said we need to talk about the future not the past were at war exactly said lloyd so i want answers to my questions now im not willing to wait because i will be going into battle soon and i dont want to die in ignorance he did not see how they could deny that argument ethel said you know all there is to know but she was not meeting his eye no i dont he said forcing himself to be patient where are my other grandparents do i have uncles and aunts and cousins teddy williams was an orphan ethel said raised in what orphanage she said irritably why are you so stubborn lloyd allowed his voice to rise in reciprocal annoyance because im like you bernie could not repress a grin thats true anyway lloyd was not amused what orphanage he might have told me but i dont remember in cardiff i think billy intervened youre touching a sore place now lloyd boy drink your beer and drop the subject lloyd said angrily ive got a bloody sore place too uncle billy thank you very much and im fed up with lies now now said bernie lets not have talk of lies im sorry dad but its got to be said lloyd held up a hand to stave off interruption last time i asked mam told me teddy williamss family came from swansea but they moved around a lot because of his fathers job now she says he was raised in an orphanage in cardiff one of those stories is a lie if not both at last ethel looked him in the eye me and bernie fed you and clothed you and sent you to school and university she said indignantly youve got nothing to complain about and ill always be grateful to you and ill always love you lloyd said billy said why have this come up now anyhow because of something somebody said to me in aberowen his mother did not respond but there was a flash of fear in her eyes someone in wales knows the truth lloyd thought he went on relentlessly i was told that perhaps maud fitzherbert fell pregnant in and her baby was passed off as yours for which you were rewarded with the house in nutley street ethel made a scornful noise lloyd held up a hand that would explain two things he said one the unlikely friendship between you and lady maud he reached into his jacket pocket two this picture of me in sidewhiskers he showed them the photograph ethel stared at the picture without speaking lloyd said it could be me couldnt it billy said testily yes lloyd it could but obviously its not so stop mucking about and tell us who it is its earl fitzherberts father now you stop mucking about uncle billy and you mam am i mauds son ethel said the friendship between me and maud was a political alliance foremost it was broken off when we disagreed about strategy for suffragettes then resumed later i like her a lot and she gave me important chances in life but there is no secret bond she doesnt know who your father is all right mam said lloyd i could believe that but this photo the explanation of that resemblance she choked up lloyd was not going to let her escape come on he said remorselessly tell me the truth billy intervened again youre barking up the wrong tree boyo he said am i well then set me straight why dont you its not for me to do that that was as good as an admission so you were lying before bernie looked gobsmacked he said to billy are you saying the teddy williams story isnt true clearly he had believed it all these years just as lloyd had billy did not reply they all looked at ethel oh bugger it she said my father would say be sure your sins will find you out well youve asked for the truth so you shall have it though you wont like it try me lloyd said recklessly youre not mauds child she said youre fitzs vii next day friday may germany invaded holland belgium and luxembourg lloyd heard the news on the radio as he sat down to breakfast with his parents and uncle billy in the boarding house he was not surprised everyone in the army had believed the invasion was imminent he was much more stunned by the revelations of the previous evening last night he had lain awake for hours angry that he had been misled so long dismayed that he was the son of a rightwing aristocratic appeaser who was also weirdly the fatherinlaw of the enchanting daisy how could you fall for him he had said to his mother in the pub her reply had been sharp dont be a hypocrite you used to be crazy about your rich american girl and she was so rightwing she married a fascist lloyd had wanted to argue that that was different but quickly realized it was the same whatever his relationship with daisy now there was no doubt that he had once felt in love with her love was not logical if he could succumb to an irrational passion so could his mother indeed they had been the same age twentyone when it had happened he had said she should have told him the truth from the start but she had an argument for that too how would you have reacted as a little boy if i had told you that you were the son of a rich man an earl how long would it have been before you boasted to the other boys at school think how they would have mocked your childish fantasy think how they would have hated you for being superior to them but later i dont know she had said wearily there never seemed to be a good time bernie had at first gone white with shock but soon recovered and became his usual phlegmatic self he said he understood why ethel had not told him the truth a secret shared is a secret no more lloyd wondered about his mothers relationship with the earl now i suppose you must see him all the time in westminster just occasionally peers have a separate section of the palace with their own restaurants and bars and when we see them its usually by arrangement that night lloyd was too shocked and bewildered to know how he felt his father was fitz the aristocrat the tory the father of boy the fatherinlaw of daisy should he be sad about it angry suicidal the revelation was so devastating that he felt numbed it was like an injury so grave that at first there was no pain the morning news gave him something else to think about in the early hours the german army had made a lightning westward strike although it was anticipated lloyd knew that the best efforts of allied intelligence had been unable to discover the date in advance and the armies of those small states had been taken by surprise nevertheless they were fighting back bravely thats probably true said uncle billy but the bbc would say it anyway prime minister chamberlain had called a cabinet meeting that was going on at that very moment however the french army reinforced by ten british divisions already in france had long ago agreed a plan for dealing with such an invasion and that plan had automatically gone into operation allied troops had crossed the french border into holland and belgium from the west and were rushing to meet the germans with the momentous news heavy on their hearts the williams family caught the bus into the town centre and made their way to bournemouth pavilion where the party conference was being held there they heard the news from westminster chamberlain was clinging to power billy learned that the prime minister had asked labour party leader clement attlee to become a cabinet minister making the government a coalition of the three main parties all three of them were aghast at this prospect chamberlain the appeaser would remain prime minister and the labour party would be obliged to support him in a coalition government it did not bear thinking about what did attlee say asked lloyd that he would have to consult his national executive committee billy replied thats us both lloyd and billy were members of the committee which had a meeting scheduled for four oclock that afternoon right said ethel lets start canvassing and find out how much support chamberlains plan might have on our executive none i should think said lloyd dont be so sure said his mother there will be some who want to keep churchill out at any price lloyd spent the next few hours in constant political activity talking to members of the committee and their friends and assistants in cafés and bars in the pavilion and along the seafront he ate no lunch but drank so much tea that he felt he might have floated he was disappointed to find that not everyone shared his view of chamberlain and churchill there were a few pacifists left over from the last war who wanted peace at any price and approved of chamberlains appeasement on the other side welsh mps still thought of churchill as the home secretary who sent the troops in to break a strike in tonypandy that had been thirty years ago but lloyd was learning that memories could be long in politics at half past three lloyd and billy walked along the seafront in a fresh breeze and entered the highcliff hotel where the meeting was to be held they thought that a majority of the committee were against accepting chamberlains offer but they could not be completely sure and lloyd was still worried about the result they went into the room and sat at the long table with the other committee members promptly at four the party leader came in clem attlee was a slim quiet unassuming man neatly dressed with a bald head and a moustache he looked like a solicitor which his father was and people tended to underestimate him in his dry unemotional way he summarized for the committee the events of the last twentyfour hours including chamberlains offer of a coalition with labour then he said i have two questions to ask you the first is would you serve in a coalition government with neville chamberlain as prime minister there was a resounding no from the people around the table more vehement than lloyd had expected he was thrilled chamberlain friend of the fascists the betrayer of spain was finished there was some justice in the world lloyd also noted how subtly the unassertive attlee had controlled the meeting he had not opened the subject for general discussion his question had not been what shall we do he had not given people the chance to express uncertainty or dither in his understated way he had put them all up against the wall and made them choose and lloyd felt sure the answer he got was the one he had wanted attlee said then the second question is would you serve in a coalition under a different prime minister the answer was not so vocal but it was yes as lloyd looked around the table it was clear to him that almost everyone was in favour if there were any against they did not bother to ask for a vote in that case said attlee i shall tell chamberlain that our party will serve in a coalition but only if he resigns and a new prime minister is appointed there was a murmur of agreement around the table lloyd noted how cleverly attlee had avoided asking who they thought the new prime minister should be attlee said i shall now go and telephone number ten downing street he left the room viii that evening winston churchill was summoned to buckingham palace in accordance with tradition and the king asked him to become prime minister lloyd had high hopes of churchill even if the man was a conservative over the weekend churchill made his dispositions he formed a fiveman war cabinet including clem attlee and arthur greenwood respectively leader and deputy leader of the labour party union leader ernie bevin became minister of labour clearly lloyd thought churchill intended to have a genuine crossparty government lloyd packed his case ready to catch the train back to aberowen once there he expected to be quickly redeployed probably to france but he only needed an hour or two he was desperate to learn the explanation of daisys behaviour last tuesday knowing he was going to see her soon increased his impatience to understand meanwhile the german army rolled across holland and belgium overcoming spirited opposition with a speed that shocked lloyd on sunday evening billy spoke on the phone to a contact in the war office and afterwards he and lloyd borrowed an old school atlas from the boardinghouse proprietress and studied the map of northwest europe billys forefinger drew an eastwest line from dusseldorf through brussels to lille the germans are thrusting at the softest part of the french defences the northern section of the border with belgium his finger moved down the page southern belgium is bordered by the ardennes forest a huge strip of hilly wooded terrain virtually impassable to modern motorized armies so my friend in the war office says his finger moved on yet farther south the frenchgerman border is defended by a series of heavy fortifications called the maginot line stretching all the way to switzerland his finger returned up the page but there are no fortifications between belgium and northern france lloyd was puzzled did no one think of this until now of course we did and we have a strategy to deal with it billy lowered his voice called plan d it cant be a secret any more since were already implementing it the best part of the french army plus all of the british expeditionary force already over there are pouring across the border into belgium they will form a solid line of defence at the dyle river that will stop the german advance lloyd was not much reassured so were committing half our forces to plan d we need to make sure it works it better they were interrupted by the proprietress who brought lloyd a telegram it had to be from the army he had given colonel ellisjones this address before going on leave he was surprised he had not heard sooner he ripped open the envelope the cable said do not return aberowen stop report southampton docks immediately stop a bientot signed ellisjones he was not going back to tŷ gwyn southampton was one of britains largest ports a common embarkation point for the continent and it was located just a few miles along the coast from bournemouth an hour perhaps by train or bus lloyd would not be seeing daisy tomorrow he realized with an ache in his heart perhaps he might never learn what she had wanted to tell him colonel ellisjoness à bientôt confirmed the obvious inference lloyd was going to france ii erik von ulrich spent the first three days of the battle of france in a traffic jam erik and his friend hermann braun were part of a medical unit attached to the nd panzer division they saw no action as they passed through southern belgium just mile after mile of hills and trees they were in the ardennes forest they reckoned they travelled on narrow roads many not even paved and a brokendown tank could cause a fiftymile tailback in no time they were stationary stuck in queues more than they were moving hermanns freckled face was set in a grimace of anxiety and he muttered to erik in an undertone no one else could hear this is stupid you should know better than to say that you were in the hitler youth said erik quietly have faith in the führer but he was not angry enough to denounce his friend when they did move it was painfully uncomfortable they sat on the hard wooden floor of an army truck as it bounced over tree roots and swerved around potholes erik longed for battle just so that he could get out of the damn truck hermann said more loudly what are we doing here their boss dr rainer weiss was sitting on a real seat beside the driver we are following the orders of the führer which are of course always correct he said it straightfaced but erik felt sure he was being sarcastic major weiss a thin man with black hair and spectacles often spoke cynically about the government and the military but always in this enigmatic way so that nothing could be proved against him anyway the army could not afford to get rid of a good doctor at this point there were two other medical orderlies in the truck both older than erik and hermann one of them christof had a better answer to hermanns question perhaps the french arent expecting us to attack here because the terrain is so difficult his friend manfred said we will have the advantage of surprise and will encounter light defences weiss said sarcastically thanks for that lesson in tactics you two most enlightening but he did not say they were wrong despite all that had happened there were still people who lacked faith in the führer to eriks amazement his own family continued to close their eyes to the triumphs of the nazis his father once a man of status and power was now a pathetic figure instead of rejoicing in the conquest of barbarian poland he just moaned about illtreatment of the poles which he must have heard about by listening illegally to a foreign radio station such behaviour could get them all into trouble including erik who was guilty of not reporting it to the local nazi block supervisor eriks mother was just as bad every now and again she disappeared with small packages of smoked fish or eggs she said nothing in explanation but erik felt sure she was taking them to frau rothmann whose jewish husband was no longer allowed to practise as a doctor despite that erik sent home a large slice of his army pay knowing his parents would be cold and hungry if he did not he hated their politics but he loved them they undoubtedly felt the same about his politics and him eriks sister carla had wanted to be a doctor like erik and had been furious when it was made clear to her that in todays germany this was a mans job she was now training as a nurse a much more appropriate role for a german girl and she too was supporting their parents with her meagre pay erik and hermann had wanted to join infantry units their idea of battle was to run at the enemy firing a rifle and kill or be killed for the fatherland but they were not going to be killing anyone both had had one year of medical school and such training was not to be wasted so they were made medical orderlies the fourth day in belgium monday may was like the first three until the afternoon above the roar and snarl of hundreds of tank and truck engines they began to hear another louder sound aircraft were flying low over their heads and not too far away dropping bombs on someone eriks nose twitched with the smell of high explosives they stopped for their midafternoon break on high ground overlooking a meandering river valley major weiss said the river was the meuse and they were west of the city of sedan so they had entered france the planes of the luftwaffe roared past them one after another diving towards the river a couple of miles away bombing and strafing the scattered villages on the banks where presumably there were french defensive positions smoke rose from countless fires among the ruined cottages and farm buildings the barrage was relentless and erik almost felt pity for anyone trapped in that inferno this was the first action he had seen before long he would be in it and perhaps some young french soldier would look from a safe vantage point and feel sorry for the germans being maimed and killed the thought made eriks heart thud with excitement like a big drum in his chest looking to the east where the details of the landscape were obscured by distance he could nevertheless see aircraft like specks and columns of smoke rising through the air and he realized that battle had been joined along several miles of this river as he watched the air bombardment came to an end the planes turning and heading north waggling their wings to say good luck as they passed overhead on their way home nearer to where erik stood on the flat plain leading to the river the german tanks were going into action they were two miles from the enemy but already the french artillery was shelling them from the town erik was surprised that so many gunners had survived the air bombardment but fire flashed in the ruins the boom of cannon was heard across the fields and fountains of french soil spurted where the shells landed erik saw a tank explode after a direct hit smoke and metal and body parts spewing out of the volcanos mouth and he felt sick but the french shelling did not stop the advance the tanks crawled on relentlessly towards the stretch of river to the east of the town which weiss said was called donchery behind them followed the infantry in trucks and on foot hermann said the air attack wasnt enough wheres our artillery we need them to take out the big guns in the town and give our tanks and infantry a chance to cross the river and establish a bridgehead erik wanted to punch him to shut his whining mouth they were about to go into action they had to be positive now but weiss said youre right braun but our artillery ammunition is gridlocked in the ardennes forest weve only got fortyeight shells a redfaced major came running past yelling move out move out major weiss pointed and said well set up our field dressing station over to the east where you see that farmhouse erik made out a low grey roof about eight hundred yards from the river all right get moving they jumped into the truck and roared down the hill when they reached level ground they swerved left along a farm track erik wondered what they would do with the family that presumably lived in the building that was about to become an army hospital throw them out of their home he guessed and shoot them if they made trouble but where would they go they were in the middle of a battlefield he need not have worried they had already left the building was half a mile from the worst of the fighting erik observed he guessed there was no point setting up a dressing station within range of enemy guns stretcher bearers get going weiss shouted by the time you get back here well be ready erik and hermann took a rolledup stretcher and first aid kit from the medical supply truck and headed towards the battle christof and manfred were just ahead of them and a dozen of their comrades followed this is it erik thought exultantly this is our chance to be heroes who will keep his nerve under fire and who will lose control and crawl into a hole and hide they ran across the fields to the river it was a long jog and it was going to seem longer coming back carrying a wounded man they passed burnedout tanks but there were no survivors and erik averted his eyes from the scorched human remains smeared across the twisted metal shells fell around them though not many the river was lightly defended and many of the guns had been taken out by the air attack all the same it was the first time in his life erik had been shot at and he felt the absurd childish impulse to cover his eyes with his hands but he kept running forward then a shell landed right in front of them there was a terrific thud and the earth shook as if a giant had stamped his foot christof and manfred were hit directly and erik saw their bodies fly up into the air as if weightless the blast threw erik off his feet as he lay on the ground face up he was showered with dirt from the explosion but he was not injured he struggled to his feet right in front of him were the mangled bodies of christof and manfred christof lay like a broken doll as if all his limbs were disjointed manfreds head had somehow been severed from his body and lay next to his booted feet erik was paralysed with horror in medical school he had not had to deal with maimed and bleeding bodies he was used to corpses in anatomy class they had had one between two students and he and hermann had shared the cadaver of a shrivelled old woman and he had watched living people being cut open on the operating table but none of that had prepared him for this he wanted nothing but to run away he turned around his mind was blank of every thought but fear he started to walk back the way they had come towards the forest away from the battle taking long determined strides hermann saved him he stood in front of erik and said where are you going dont be a fool erik kept moving and tried to walk past him hermann punched him in the stomach really hard and erik folded over and fell to his knees dont run away hermann said urgently youll be shot for desertion pull yourself together while erik was trying to catch his breath he came to his senses he could not run away he must not desert he had to stay here he realized slowly his willpower overcame his terror eventually he got to his feet hermann looked at him warily sorry said erik i panicked im all right now then pick up the stretcher and keep going erik picked up the rolled stretcher balanced it on his shoulder turned around and ran on closer to the river erik and hermann found themselves among infantry some were manhandling inflated rubber dinghies out of the backs of trucks and carrying them to the waters edge while the tanks tried to cover them by firing at the french defences but erik rapidly recovering his mental powers soon saw that it was a losing battle the french were behind walls and inside buildings while the german infantry were exposed on the bank of the river as soon as they got a dinghy into the water it came under intense machinegun fire upstream the river turned a rightangled bend so the infantry could not move out of range of the french without retreating a long distance there were already many dead and wounded men on the ground lets pick this one up hermann said decisively and erik bent to the task they unrolled their stretcher on the ground next to a groaning infantryman erik gave him water from a flask as he had learned in training the man seemed to have numerous superficial wounds on his face and one limp arm erik guessed he had been hit by machinegun fire that luckily had missed his vital areas he saw no gush of blood so they did not attempt to staunch his wounds they lifted the man on to the stretcher picked it up and began to jog back to the dressing station the wounded man cried out in agony as they moved then when they stopped he shouted keep going keep going and gritted his teeth carrying a man on a stretcher was not as easy as it might seem erik thought his arms would fall off when they were only halfway but he could see that the patient was in greater pain by far and he just kept running shells no longer fell around them he noticed gratefully the french were concentrating all their fire on the river bank trying to prevent the germans crossing at last erik and hermann reached the farmhouse with their burden weiss had the place organized the rooms cleared of superfluous furniture places marked on the floor for patients the kitchen table set up for operations he showed erik and hermann where to put the wounded man then he sent them back for another the run back to the river was easier they were unburdened and going slightly downhill as they approached the bank erik wondered fearfully whether he would panic again he saw with trepidation that the battle was going badly there were several deflated vessels in midstream and many more bodies on the bank and still no germans on the far side hermann said this is a catastrophe we should have waited for our artillery his voice was shrill erik said then we would have lost the advantage of surprise and the french would have had time to bring up reinforcements there would have been no point in that long trek through the ardennes well this isnt working said hermann deep in his heart erik was beginning to wonder whether the führers plans really were infallible the thought undermined his resolution and threatened to throw him completely off balance fortunately there was no more time for reflection they stopped beside a man with most of one leg blown off he was about their age twenty with pale freckled skin and copperred hair his right leg ended at midthigh in a ragged stump amazingly he was conscious and he stared at them as if they were angels of mercy erik found the pressure point in his groin and stopped the bleeding while hermann got out a tourniquet and applied it then they put him on the stretcher and began the run back hermann was a loyal german but he sometimes allowed negative feelings to get the better of him if erik ever had such feelings he was careful not to voice them that way he did not lower anyone elses morale and he stayed out of trouble but he could not help thinking it seemed the approach through the ardennes had not given the germans the walkover victory they had expected the meuse defences were light but the french were fighting back fiercely surely he thought his first experience of battle was not going to destroy his faith in his führer the idea made him feel panicky he wondered whether the german forces farther east were faring any better the st panzer and the th panzer had been alongside eriks division the nd as they approached the border and it must be they who were attacking upstream his arm muscles were now in constant agony they arrived back at the dressing station for the second time the place was now frantically busy the floor crowded with men groaning and crying bloody bandages everywhere weiss and his assistants moving quickly from one maimed body to the next erik had never imagined there could be so much suffering in one small place somehow when the führer spoke of war erik never thought of this kind of thing then he noticed that his own patients eyes were closed major weiss felt for a pulse then said harshly put him in the barn and for fucks sake dont waste time bringing me corpses erik could have cried with frustration and with the pain in his arms which was beginning to afflict his legs too they put the body in the barn and saw that there were already a dozen dead young men there this was worse than anything he had envisaged when he had thought about battle he had foreseen courage in the face of danger stoicism in suffering heroism in adversity what he saw now was agony screaming blind terror broken bodies and a complete lack of faith in the wisdom of the mission they went back again to the river the sun was low in the sky now and something had changed on the battlefield the french defenders in donchery were being shelled from the far side of the river erik guessed that farther upstream the st panzers had had better luck and had secured a bridgehead on the south bank and now they were coming to the aid of the comrades on their flanks clearly they had not lost their ammunition in the forest heartened erik and hermann rescued another wounded man when they got back to the dressing station this time they were given tin bowls of a tasty soup resting for ten minutes while he drank the soup made erik want to lie down and go to sleep for the night it took a mighty effort to stand up and pick up his end of the stretcher and jog back to the battlefield now they saw a different scene tanks were crossing the river on rafts the germans on the far side were coming under heavy fire but they were shooting back with the help of reinforcements from the st panzers erik saw that his side had a chance of winning their objective after all he was heartened and he began to feel ashamed that he had doubted the führer he and hermann kept on retrieving the wounded hour after hour until they forgot what it was like to be free from pain in their arms and legs some of their charges were unconscious some thanked them some cursed them many just screamed some lived and some died by eight oclock that evening there was a german bridgehead on the far side of the river and by ten it was secure the fighting came to an end at nightfall erik and hermann continued to sweep the battlefield for wounded men they brought back the last one at midnight then they lay down under a tree and fell into a sleep of utter exhaustion next day erik and hermann and the rest of the nd panzers turned west and broke through what remained of the french defences two days later they were fifty miles away at the river oise and moving fast through undefended territory by may a week after emerging unexpectedly from the ardennes forest they had reached the coast of the english channel major weiss explained their achievement to erik and hermann our attack on belgium was a feint you see its purpose was to draw the french and british into a trap we panzer divisions formed the jaws of the trap and now we have them between our teeth much of the french army and nearly all of the british expeditionary force are in belgium encircled by the german army they are cut off from supplies and reinforcements helpless and defeated erik said triumphantly this was the führers plan all along yes said weiss and as ever erik could not tell whether he was sincere no one thinks like the führer ii lloyd williams was in a football stadium somewhere between calais and paris with him were another thousand or more british prisoners of war they had no shelter from the blazing june sun but they were grateful for the warm nights as they had no blankets there were no toilets and no water for washing lloyd was digging a hole with his hands he had organized some of the welsh miners to make latrines at one end of the soccer pitch and he was working alongside them to show willing other men joined in having nothing else to do and soon there were a hundred or so helping when a guard strolled over to see what was going on lloyd explained you speak good german said the guard amiably whats your name lloyd im dieter lloyd decided to exploit this small expression of friendliness we could dig faster if we had tools whats the hurry better hygiene would benefit you as well as us dieter shrugged and went away lloyd felt awkwardly unheroic he had seen no fighting the welsh rifles had gone to france as reserves to relieve other units in what was expected to be a long battle but it had taken the germans only ten days to defeat the bulk of the allied army many of the defeated british troops had then been evacuated from calais and dunkirk but thousands had missed the boat and lloyd was among them presumably the germans were now pushing south as far as he knew the french were still fighting but their best troops had been annihilated in belgium and there was a triumphant look about the german guards as if they knew victory was assured lloyd was a prisoner of war but how long would he remain so at this point there must be powerful pressure on the british government to make peace churchill would never do so but he was a maverick different from all other politicians and he could be deposed men such as lord halifax would have little difficulty signing a peace treaty with the nazis the same was true lloyd thought bitterly of the junior foreign office minister earl fitzherbert whom he now shamefully knew to be his father if peace came soon his time as a prisoner of war could be short he might spend all of it here in this french arena he would go home scrawny and sunburnt but otherwise whole but if the british fought on it would be a different matter the last war had continued more than four years lloyd could not bear the thought of wasting four years of his life in a prisonerofwar camp to avoid that he decided he would try to escape dieter reappeared carrying half a dozen spades lloyd gave them to the strongest men and the work went faster at some point the prisoners would have to be moved to a permanent camp that would be the time to make a run for it based on experience in spain lloyd guessed that the army would not prioritize the guarding of prisoners if one tried to get away he might succeed or he might be shot dead either way it was one less mouth to feed they spent the rest of the day completing the latrines apart from the improvement in hygiene this project had boosted morale and lloyd lay awake that night looking at the stars trying to think of other communal activities he might organize he decided on a grand athletics contest a prisoncamp olympic games but he did not have the chance to put this into practice for the next morning they were marched away at first he was not sure of the direction they were taking but before long they got on to a route napoléon twolane road and began to go steadily east in all probability lloyd thought they were intended to walk all the way to germany once there he knew escape would be much more difficult he had to seize this opportunity and the sooner the better he was scared those guards had guns but determined there was not much motor traffic other than the occasional german staff car but the road was busy with people on foot heading in the opposite direction with their possessions in handcarts and wheelbarrows some driving their livestock ahead of them they were clearly refugees whose homes had been destroyed in battle that was a heartening sign lloyd told himself an escaped prisoner might hide himself among them the prisoners were lightly guarded there were only ten germans in charge of this moving column of a thousand men the guards had one car and a motorcycle the rest were on foot and on civilian bicycles which they must have commandeered from the locals all the same escape seemed hopeless at first there were no englishstyle hedgerows to provide cover and the ditches were too shallow to hide in a man running away would provide an easy target for a competent rifleman then they entered a village here it was a little harder for the guards to keep an eye on everyone local men and women stood at the edges of the column staring at the prisoners a small flock of sheep got mixed up with them there were cottages and shops beside the road lloyd watched hopefully for his opportunity he needed a place to hide instantly an open door or a passage between houses or a bush to hide behind and he needed to be passing it at a moment when none of the guards was in sight in a couple of minutes he had left the village behind without spotting his opportunity he felt annoyed and told himself to be patient there would be more chances it was a long way to germany on the other hand with every day that passed the germans would tighten their grip on conquered territory improve their organization impose curfews and passes and checkpoints stop the movement of refugees being on the run would be easier at first harder as time went on it was hot and he took off his uniform jacket and tie he would get rid of them as soon as he could close up he probably still looked like a british soldier in his khaki trousers and shirt but at a distance he hoped he would not be so conspicuous they passed through two more villages then came to a small town this should present some possible escape routes lloyd thought nervously he realized that a part of him hoped he would not see a good opportunity would not have to put himself in danger of those rifles was he getting accustomed to captivity already it was too easy to continue marching footsore but safe he had to snap out of it the road through the town was unfortunately broad the column kept to the middle of the street leaving wide aisles either side that would have to be crossed before an escaper could find concealment some shops were closed and a few buildings were boarded up but lloyd could see promisinglooking alleys cafés with open doors a church but he could not get to any of them unobserved he studied the faces of the townspeople as they stared at the passing prisoners were they sympathetic would they remember that these men had fought for france or would they be understandably terrified of the germans and refuse to put themselves in danger half and half probably some would risk their lives to help others would hand him over to the germans in a heartbeat and he would not be able to tell the difference until it was too late they reached the town centre ive lost half my opportunities already he told himself i have to act up ahead he saw a crossroads an oncoming line of traffic was waiting to turn left its way blocked by the marching men lloyd saw a civilian pickup truck in the queue dusty and battered it looked as if it might belong to a builder or a road mender the back was open but lloyd could not see inside for its sides were high he thought he might be able to pull himself up the side and scramble over the edge into the truck once inside he could not be seen by anyone standing or walking on the street nor by the guards on their bikes but he would be plainly visible to people looking out of the upstairs windows of the buildings that lined the streets would they betray him he came closer to the truck he looked back the nearest guard was two hundred yards behind he looked ahead a guard on a bicycle was twenty yards in front he said to the man beside him hold this for me would you and gave him his jacket he drew level with the front of the truck at the wheel was a boredlooking man in overalls and a beret with a cigarette dangling from his lip lloyd passed him then he was level with the side of the truck there was no time to check the guards again without breaking step lloyd put both hands on the side of the truck heaved himself up threw one leg over then the other and fell inside hitting the bed of the truck with a crash that seemed terribly loud despite the tramp of a thousand pairs of feet he flattened himself immediately he lay still listening for a clamour of shouted german the roar of a motorcycle approaching the crack of a rifle shot he heard the irregular snore of the trucks engine the stamp and shuffle of the prisoners feet the background noises of a small towns traffic and people had he got away with it he looked around him keeping his head low in the truck with him were buckets planks a ladder and a wheelbarrow he had been hoping for a few sacks with which to cover himself but there were none he heard a motorcycle it seemed to come to a halt nearby then a few inches from his head someone spoke french with a strong german accent where are you going a guard was talking to the truck driver lloyd figured with a racing heart would the guard try to look into the back he heard the driver reply an indignant stream of fast french that lloyd could not decipher the german soldier almost certainly could not understand it either he asked the question again looking up lloyd saw two women at a high window overlooking the street they were staring at him mouths open in surprise one was pointing her arm sticking out through the open window lloyd tried to catch her eye lying still he moved one hand from side to side in a gesture that meant no she got the message she withdrew her arm suddenly and covered her mouth with her hand as if realizing with horror that her pointing could be a sentence of death lloyd wanted both women to move away from the window but that was too much to hope for and they continued to stare then the motorcycle guard seemed to decide not to pursue his enquiry for a moment later the motorcycle roared away the sound of feet receded the body of prisoners had passed was lloyd free there was a crash of gears and the truck moved lloyd felt it turn the corner and pick up speed he lay still too scared to move he watched the tops of buildings pass by alert in case anyone else should spot him though he did not know what he would do if it happened every second was taking him away from the guards he told himself encouragingly to his disappointment the truck came to a halt quite soon the engine was turned off then the drivers door opened and slammed shut then nothing lloyd lay still for a while but the driver did not return lloyd looked at the sky the sun was high it must be after midday the driver was probably having lunch the trouble was lloyd continued to be visible from high windows on both sides of the street if he remained where he was he would be noticed sooner or later and then there was no telling what might happen he saw a curtain twitch in an attic and that decided him he stood up and looked over the side a man in a business suit walking along the pavement stared in curiosity but did not stop lloyd scrambled over the side of the truck and dropped to the ground he found himself outside a barrestaurant no doubt that was where the driver had gone to lloyds horror there were two men in german army uniforms sitting at a window table with glasses of beer in their hands by a miracle they did not look at lloyd he walked quickly away he looked around alertly as he walked everyone he passed stared at him they knew exactly what he was one woman screamed and ran away he realized he needed to change his khaki shirt and trousers for something more french in the next few minutes a young man took him by the arm come with me he said in english with a heavy accent i will elp you ide he turned down a side street lloyd had no reason to trust this man but he had to make a splitsecond decision and he went along this way the young man said and steered lloyd into a small house in a bare kitchen was a young woman with a baby the young man introduced himself as maurice the woman as his wife marcelle and the baby as simone lloyd allowed himself a moment of grateful relief he had escaped from the germans he was still in danger but he was off the streets and in a friendly house the stiffly correct french lloyd had learned in school and at cambridge had become more colloquial during his escape from spain and especially in the two weeks he spent picking grapes in bordeaux youre very kind he said thank you maurice replied in french evidently relieved not to have to speak english i guess youd like something to eat very much marcelle rapidly cut several slices off a long loaf and put them on the table with a round of cheese and a wine bottle with no label lloyd sat down and tucked in ravenously ill give you some old clothes said maurice but also you must try to walk differently you were striding along looking all around you so alert and interested you might as well have a sign around your neck saying visitor from england better to shuffle with your eyes on the ground with his mouth full of bread and cheese lloyd said ill remember that there was a small shelf of books including french translations of marx and lenin maurice noticed lloyd looking at them and said i was a communist until the hitlerstalin pact now its finished he made a swift cuttingoff gesture with his hand all the same we have to defeat fascism i was in spain said lloyd before that i believed in a united front of all left parties not any more simone cried marcelle lifted a large breast out of her loose dress and began to feed the baby french women were more relaxed about this than the prudish british lloyd remembered when he had eaten maurice took him upstairs from a wardrobe that had very little in it he took a pair of darkblue overalls a lightblue shirt underwear and socks all worn but clean the kindness of this evidently poor man overwhelmed lloyd and he had no idea how to say thank you just leave your army clothes on the floor maurice said ill burn them lloyd would have liked a wash but there was no bathroom he guessed it was in the back yard he put on the fresh clothes and studied his reflection in a mirror hanging on the wall french blue suited him better than army khaki but he still looked british he went back downstairs marcelle was burping the baby hat she said maurice produced a typical french beret dark blue and lloyd put it on then maurice looked anxiously at lloyds stout black leather british army boots dusty but unmistakably good quality they give you away he said lloyd did not want to give up his boots he had a long way to walk perhaps we can make them look older he said maurice looked doubtful how do you have a sharp knife maurice took a clasp knife from his pocket lloyd took his boots off he cut holes in the toecaps then slashed the ankles he removed the laces and rethreaded them untidily now they looked like something a downandout would wear but they still fit well and had thick soles that would last many miles maurice said where will you go i have two options lloyd said i can head north to the coast and hope to persuade a fisherman to take me across the english channel or i can go southwest across the border into spain spain was neutral and still had british consuls in major cities i know the spanish route ive travelled it twice the channel is a lot nearer than spain maurice said but i think the germans will close all the ports and harbours wheres the front line the germans have taken paris lloyd suffered a moment of shock paris had fallen already the french government has moved to bordeaux maurice shrugged but we are beaten nothing can save france now all europe will be fascist lloyd said except for britain so you must go home lloyd mused north or southwest he could not tell which would be better maurice said i have a friend a former communist who sells cattle feed to farmers i happen to know hes delivering this afternoon to a place southwest of here if you decide to go to spain he could take you twenty miles that helped lloyd make up his mind ill go with him he said iii daisy had been on a long journey that had brought her around in a circle when lloyd was sent to france she was heartbroken she had missed her chance of telling him she loved him she had not even kissed him and now there might never be another opportunity he was reported missing in action after dunkirk that meant his body had not been found and identified but neither was he registered as a prisoner of war most likely he was dead blown up into unidentifiable fragments by a shell or perhaps lying unmarked beneath the debris of a destroyed farmhouse she cried for days for another month she moped about tŷ gwyn hoping to hear more but no further news came then she began to feel guilty there were many women as badly off as she or worse some had to face the prospect of raising two or three children with no man to support the family she had no right to feel sorry for herself just because the man with whom she had been contemplating an adulterous affair was missing she had to pull herself together and do something positive fate did not intend her to be with lloyd that was clear she already had a husband one who was risking his life every day it was her duty she told herself to take care of boy she returned to london she opened up the mayfair house as best she could with limited servants and made it into a pleasant home for boy to come to when on leave she needed to forget lloyd and be a good wife perhaps she would even get pregnant again many women signed up for war work joining the womens auxiliary air force or doing agricultural labour with the womens land army others worked for no pay in the womens voluntary service for air raid precautions but there was not enough for most such women to do and the times published letters to the editor complaining that air raid precautions were a waste of money the war in continental europe appeared to be over germany had won europe was fascist from poland to sicily and from hungary to portugal there was no fighting anywhere rumours said the british government had discussed peace terms but churchill did not make peace with hitler and that summer the battle of britain began at first civilians were not much affected church bells were silenced their peal reserved to warn of the expected german invasion daisy followed government instructions and placed buckets of sand and water on every landing in the house for firefighting but they were not needed the luftwaffe bombed harbours hoping to cut britains supply lines then they started on air bases trying to destroy the royal air force boy was flying a spitfire engaging enemy aircraft in sky battles that were watched by openmouthed farmers in kent and sussex in a rare letter home he said proudly that he had shot down three german planes he had no leave for weeks on end and daisy sat alone in the house she filled with flowers for him at last on the morning of saturday september boy showed up with a weekend pass the weather was glorious hot and sunny a late spell of warmth that people called an indian summer as it happened that was the day the luftwaffe changed their tactics daisy kissed her husband and made sure there were clean shirts and fresh underwear in his dressing room from what other women said she believed that fighting men on leave wanted sex booze and decent food in that order boy and she had not slept together since the miscarriage this would be the first time she felt guilty that she did not really relish the prospect but she certainly would not refuse to do her duty she half expected him to tumble her into bed the minute he arrived but he was not that desperate he took off his uniform bathed and washed his hair and dressed again in a civilian suit daisy ordered the cook to spare no ration coupons in the preparation of a good lunch and boy brought up from the cellar one of his oldest bottles of claret she was surprised and hurt after lunch when he said im going out for a few hours ill be back for dinner she wanted to be a good wife but not a passive one this is your first leave for months she protested where the heck are you going to look at a horse that was all right oh fine ill come with you no dont if i show up with a woman in tow theyll think im a softie and put the price up she could not hide her disappointment i always dreamed this would be something we did together buying and breeding racehorses its not really a womans world oh stink on that she said indignantly i know as much about horseflesh as you do he looked irritated perhaps you do but i still dont want you hanging around when im bargaining with these blighters and thats final she gave in as you please she said and she left the dining room her instinct told her that he was lying fighting men on leave did not think about buying horses she intended to find out what he was up to even heroes had to be true to their wives in her room she put on trousers and boots as boy went down the main staircase to the front door she ran down the back stairs through the kitchen across the yard and into the old stables there she put on a leather jacket goggles and a crash helmet she opened the garage door into the mews and wheeled out her motorcycle a triumph tiger so called because its top speed was one hundred miles per hour she kicked it into life and drove out of the mews effortlessly she had taken quickly to motorcycling when petrol rationing was introduced back in september it was like bicycling but easier she loved the freedom and independence it gave her she turned into the street just in time to see boys creamcoloured bentley airline disappear around the next corner she followed he drove across trafalgar square and through the theatre district daisy stayed a discreet distance behind not wanting to be conspicuous there was still plenty of traffic in central london where there were hundreds of cars on official business in addition the petrol ration for private vehicles was not unreasonably small especially for people who only wanted to drive around town boy continued east through the financial district there was little traffic here on a saturday afternoon and daisy became more concerned about being noticed but she was not easily recognizable in her goggles and helmet and boy was paying little attention to his surroundings driving with the window open smoking a cigar he headed into aldgate and daisy had a dreadful feeling she knew why he turned into one of the east ends less squalid streets and parked outside a pleasant eighteenthcentury house there were no stables in sight this was not a place where racehorses were bought and sold so much for his story daisy stopped her motorcycle at the end of the street and watched boy got out of the car and slammed the door he did not look around or study the house numbers clearly he had been here before and knew exactly where he was going walking with a jaunty air cigar in his mouth he went up to the front door and opened it with a key daisy wanted to cry boy disappeared into the house somewhere to the east there was an explosion daisy looked in that direction and saw planes in the sky had the germans chosen today to begin bombing london if so she did not care she was not going to let boy enjoy his infidelity in peace she drove up to the house and parked her bike behind his car she took off her helmet and goggles marched up to the front door of the house and knocked she heard another explosion this one closer then the air raid sirens began their mournful song the door came open a crack and she shoved it hard a young woman in a maids black dress cried out and staggered backwards and daisy walked in she slammed the door behind her she was in the hallway of a standard middleclass london house but it was decorated in exotic fashion with oriental rugs heavy curtains and a painting of naked women in a bathhouse she threw open the nearest door and stepped into the front parlour it was dimly lit velvet drapes keeping out the sunlight there were three people in the room standing up staring at her in shock was a woman of about forty dressed in a loose silk wrap but carefully made up with bright red lipstick the mother she assumed behind her sitting on a couch was a girl of about sixteen wearing only underwear and stockings smoking a cigarette next to the girl sat boy his hand on her thigh above the top of the stocking he snatched his hand away guiltily it was a ludicrous gesture as if taking his hand off her could make this tableau look innocent daisy fought back tears you promised me you would give them up she said she wanted to be coldly angry like the avenging angel but she could hear that her voice was just wounded and sad boy reddened and looked panicked what the devil are you doing here the older woman said oh fuck its his wife her name was pearl daisy recalled and the daughter was joanie how dreadful that she should know the names of such women the maid came to the door of the room and said i didnt let the bitch in she just shoved past me daisy said to boy i tried so hard to make our home beautiful and welcoming for you and yet you prefer this he started to say something but had trouble finding his words he sputtered incoherently for a moment or two then a big explosion nearby shook the floor and rattled the windows the maid said are you all deaf theres a fucking air raid on no one looked at her im going down the basement she said and she disappeared they all needed to seek shelter but daisy had something to say to boy before she left dont come to my bed again ever please i refuse to be contaminated the girl on the couch joanie said its only a bit of fun love why dont you join in you might like it pearl the older one looked daisy up and down shes got a nice little figure daisy realized they would humiliate her further if she gave them the chance ignoring them she spoke to boy youve made your choice she said and ive made my decision she left the room holding her head high even though she felt debased and spurned she heard boy said oh damn what a mess a mess she thought is that all she went out of the front door then she looked up the sky was full of planes the sight made her shake with fear they were high about ten thousand feet but all the same they seemed to block the sun there were hundreds of them fat bombers and waspish fighters a fleet that seemed twenty miles wide to the east in the direction of the docks and woolwich arsenal palls of smoke rose from the ground where the bombs were landing the explosions ran together into a continuous tidal roar like an angry sea daisy recalled that hitler had made a speech in the german parliament just last wednesday ranting about the wickedness of raf bombing raids on berlin and threatening to erase british cities in retaliation apparently he had meant it they were intending to flatten london this was already the worst day of daisys life now she realized it might be the last but she could not bring herself to go back into that house and share their basement shelter she had to get away she needed to be at home where she could cry in private hurriedly she put on helmet and goggles she resisted an irrational but nonetheless powerful impulse to throw herself behind the nearest wall she jumped on her motorcycle and drove away she did not get far two streets away a bomb landed on a house directly in her line of vision and she braked suddenly she saw the hole in the roof felt the thump of the explosion and a few seconds later saw flames inside as if kerosene from a heater had spilled and caught fire a moment later a girl of about twelve came out screaming with her hair on fire and ran straight at daisy daisy jumped off the bike pulled off her leather jacket and used it to cover the girls head wrapping it tightly over the hair denying oxygen to the flames the screaming stopped daisy removed the jacket the girl was sobbing she was no longer in agony but she was bald daisy looked up and down the street a man wearing a steel helmet and an arp armband came running up carrying a tin case with a white first aid cross painted on its side the girl looked at daisy opened her mouth and screamed my mothers in there the arp warden said calm down love lets have a look at you daisy left the girl with him and ran to the front door of the building it seemed to be an old house subdivided into cheap apartments the upper floors were burning but she was able to enter the hall taking a guess she ran to the back and found herself in a kitchen there she saw a woman unconscious on the floor and a toddler in a cot she picked up the child and ran out again the girl with the burned hair yelled thats my sister daisy thrust the toddler into the girls arms and ran back inside the unconscious woman was too heavy for her to lift daisy got behind her raised her to a sitting position took hold of her under the arms and dragged her across the kitchen floor and through the hallway into the street an ambulance had arrived a converted saloon car its rear bodywork replaced by a canvas roof with a back opening the arp warden was helping the burned girl into the vehicle the driver came running over to daisy between them they lifted the mother into the ambulance the driver said to daisy is there anyone else inside i dont know he ran into the hall at that moment the entire building sagged the burning upper storeys crashed through to the ground floor the ambulance driver disappeared into an inferno daisy heard herself scream she covered her mouth with her hand and stared into the flames searching for him even though she could not have helped him and it would have been suicide to try the arp warden said oh my god alfs been killed there was another explosion as a bomb landed a hundred yards along the street the warden said now ive got no driver and i cant leave the scene he looked up and down the street there were little knots of people standing outside some of the houses but most were probably in shelters daisy said ill drive it where should i go can you drive most british women could not drive it was still a mans job here dont ask stupid questions daisy said where am i taking the ambulance st barts do you know where it is of course st bartholomews was one of the biggest hospitals in london and daisy had been living here for four years west smithfield she added to make sure he believed her emergency ward is around the back ill find it she jumped in the engine was still running the warden shouted whats your name daisy fitzherbert whats yours nobby clarke take care of my ambulance the car had a standard gearshift with a clutch daisy put it into first and drove off the planes continued to roar overhead and the bombs fell relentlessly daisy was desperate to get the injured people to hospital and st barts was not much more than a mile away but the journey was maddeningly difficult she drove along leadenhall street poultry and cheapside but several times she found the road blocked and had to reverse away and find another route there seemed to be at least one destroyed house in every street everywhere was smoke and rubble people bleeding and crying with huge relief she reached the hospital and followed another ambulance to the emergency entrance the place was frantically busy with a dozen vehicles discharging maimed and burned patients into the care of hurrying porters with bloodstained aprons perhaps ive saved the mother of these children daisy thought im not completely worthless even if my husband doesnt want me the girl with no hair was still carrying her baby sister daisy helped them both out of the back of her ambulance a nurse helped daisy lift the unconscious mother and carry her in but daisy could see that the woman had stopped breathing she said to the nurse these two are her children she heard the edge of hysteria in her own voice what will happen now ill deal with it the nurse said briskly you have to go back must i said daisy pull yourself together said the nurse there will be a lot more dead and injured before this night is over all right said daisy and she got back behind the wheel and drove off iv on a warm mediterranean afternoon in october lloyd williams arrived in the sunlit french town of perpignan only twenty miles from the border with spain he had spent the month of september in the bordeaux area picking grapes for the wine harvest just as he had in the terrible year of now he had money in his pockets for buses and trams and could eat in cheap restaurants instead of living on unripe vegetables he dug up in peoples gardens or raw eggs stolen from hencoops he was going back along the route he had taken when he left spain three years ago he had come south from bordeaux through toulouse and béziers occasionally riding freight trains mostly begging lifts from truck drivers now he was at a roadside café on the main highway running southeast from perpignan towards the spanish border still dressed in maurices blue overalls and beret he carried a small canvas bag containing a rusty trowel and a mortarspattered spirit level evidence that he was a spanish bricklayer making his way home god forbid that anyone should offer him work he had no idea how to build a wall he was worried about finding his way across the mountains three months ago back in picardy he had told himself glibly that he could find the route over the pyrenees along which his guides had led him into spain in parts of which he had retraced in the opposite direction when he left a year later but as the purple peaks and green passes came into distant view on the horizon the prospect seemed more daunting he had thought that every step of the journey must be engraved on his memory but when he tried to recall specific paths and bridges and turning points he found that the pictures were blurred and the exact details slipped infuriatingly from his minds grasp he finished his lunch a peppery fish stew then spoke quietly to a group of drivers at the next table i need a lift to cerbère it was the last village before the spanish border anyone going that way they were probably all going that way it was the only reason for being here on this southeast route all the same they hesitated this was vichy france technically an independent zone in practice under the thumb of the germans occupying the other half of the country no one was in a hurry to help a travelling stranger with a foreign accent im a mason he said hefting his canvas bag going home to spain leandro is my name a fat man in an undershirt said i can take you halfway thank you are you ready now of course they went outside and got into a grimy renault van with the name of an electrical goods store on the side as they pulled away the driver asked lloyd if he was married a series of unpleasantly personal inquiries followed and lloyd realized the man had a fascination with other peoples sex lives no doubt that was why he had agreed to take lloyd it gave him the chance to ask intrusive questions several of the men who had given lloyd lifts had had some such creepy motive im a virgin lloyd told him which was true but that only led to an interrogation about heavy petting with schoolgirls lloyd did have considerable experience of that but he was not going to share it he refused to give details while trying not to be rude and eventually the driver despaired i have to turn off here he said and pulled up lloyd thanked him for the ride and walked on he had learned not to march like a soldier and had developed what he thought was a fairly realistic peasant slouch he never carried a newspaper or a book his hair had last been cut by a brutally incompetent barber in the poorest quarter of toulouse he shaved about once a week so that he normally had a growth of stubble which was surprisingly effective in making him look like a nobody he had stopped washing and acquired a ripe odour that discouraged people from talking to him few workingclass people had watches in france or spain so the steel wristwatch with the square face that bernie had given him as a graduation present had to go he could not give it to one of the many french people who had helped him for a british watch could have incriminated them too in the end with great sadness he had thrown it into a pond his greatest weakness was that he had no identity papers he had tried to buy papers from a man who looked vaguely like him and schemed to steal them from two others but not surprisingly people were cautious about such things these days his strategy was therefore to steer clear of situations in which he might be asked to identify himself he made himself inconspicuous he walked across fields rather than take roads when he had the choice and he never travelled by passenger train because there were often checkpoints at stations so far he had been lucky one village gendarme had demanded his papers and when he explained that they had been stolen from him after he got drunk and passed out in a bar in marseilles the policeman had believed him and sent him on his way now however his luck ran out he was passing through poor agricultural terrain he was in the foothills of the pyrenees close to the mediterranean and the soil was sandy the dusty road ran through struggling smallholdings and poor villages the landscape was sparsely populated to his left through the hills he got blue glimpses of the distant sea the last thing he expected was the green citroën that pulled up alongside him with three gendarmes inside it happened very suddenly he heard the car approaching the only car he had heard since the fat man had dropped him off he carried on shuffling like a tired worker going home either side of the road were dry fields with sparse vegetation and stunted trees when the car stopped he thought for a second of making a run for it across the fields he dropped the idea when he saw the holstered pistols of the two gendarmes who jumped out of the car they were probably not very good shots but they might get lucky his chances of talking his way out of this were better these were country constables more amiable than the hardnosed french city police papers said the nearest gendarme in french lloyd spread his hands in a helpless gesture monsieur i am so unfortunate my papers were stolen in marseilles i am leandro spanish mason going get in the car lloyd hesitated but it was hopeless the odds against his getting away were now worse than before a gendarme took him firmly by the arm hustled him into the back seat and got in beside him his spirits sank as the car pulled away the gendarme next to him said are you english or what i am spanish mason my name the gendarme made a wavingaway gesture and said dont bother lloyd saw that he had been wildly optimistic he was a foreigner without papers heading for the spanish border they simply assumed he was an escaping british soldier if they had any doubt they would find proof when they ordered him to strip for they would see the identity tag around his neck he had not thrown it away for without it he would automatically be shot as a spy and now he was stuck in a car with three armed men and the likelihood that he would find a way to escape was zero they drove on in the direction in which he had been heading as the sun went down over the mountains on their righthand side there were no big towns between here and the border so he assumed they intended to put him in a village jail for the night perhaps he could escape from there failing that they would undoubtedly take him back to perpignan tomorrow and hand him over to the city police what then would he be interrogated the prospect made him cold with fear the french police would beat him up the germans would torture him if he survived he would end up in a prisoner of war camp where he would remain until the end of the war or until he died of malnutrition and yet he was only a few miles from the border they drove into a small town could he escape between the car and the jail he could make no plan he did not know the terrain there was nothing he could do but remain alert and seize any opportunity the car turned off the main street and into an alley behind a row of shops were they going to shoot him here and dump his body the car stopped at the back of a restaurant the yard was littered with boxes and giant cans through a small window lloyd could see a brightly lit kitchen the gendarme in the front passenger seat got out then opened lloyds door on the side of the car nearest the building was this his chance he would have to run around the car and along the alley it was dusk after the first few yards he would not be an easy target the gendarme reached into the car and grasped lloyds arm holding him as he got out and stood up the second one got out immediately behind lloyd the opportunity was not good enough but why had they brought him here they walked him into the kitchen a chef was beating eggs in a bowl and an adolescent boy was washing up in a big sink one of the gendarmes said heres an englishman he calls himself leandro without pausing in his work the chef lifted his head and bawled teresa come here lloyd remembered another teresa a beautiful spanish anarchist who had taught soldiers to read and write the kitchen door swung wide and she walked in lloyd stared at her in astonishment there was no possibility of mistake he would never forget those big eyes and that mass of black hair even though she wore the white cotton cap and apron of a waitress at first she did not look at him she put a pile of plates on the counter next to the young washerup then turned to the gendarmes with a smile and kissed each on both cheeks saying pierre michel how are you then she turned to lloyd stared at him and said in spanish no its not possible lloyd is it really you he could only nod dumbly she put her arms around him embraced him and kissed him on both cheeks one of the gendarmes said there we are all is well we have to go good luck he handed lloyd his canvas bag then they left lloyd found his tongue whats going on he said to teresa in spanish i thought i was being taken to jail they hate the nazis so they help us she said who is us ill explain later come with me she opened a door that gave on to a staircase and led him to an upper storey where there was a sparsely furnished bedroom wait here ill bring you something to eat lloyd lay down on the bed and contemplated his extraordinary fortune five minutes ago he had been expecting torture and death now he was waiting for a beautiful woman to bring him supper it could change again just as quickly he reflected she returned half an hour later with an omelette and fried potatoes on a thick plate weve been busy but we close soon she said ill be back in a few minutes he ate the food quickly night fell he listened to the chatter of customers leaving and the clang of pots being put away then teresa reappeared with a bottle of red wine and two glasses lloyd asked her why she had left spain our people are being murdered by the thousand she said for those they dont kill they have passed the law of political responsibilities making criminals of everyone who supported the government you can lose all your assets if you opposed franco even by grave passivity you are innocent only if you can prove you supported him lloyd thought bitterly of chamberlains reassurance to the house of commons back in march that franco had renounced political reprisals what an evil liar chamberlain had been teresa went on many of our comrades are in filthy prison camps i dont suppose you have any idea what happened to sergeant lenny griffiths my friend teresa shook her head i never saw him again after belchite and you i escaped from francos men came here got a job as a waitress and found there was other work for me to do what work i take escaping soldiers across the mountains thats why the gendarmes brought you to me lloyd was heartened he had been planning to do it alone and he had been worried about finding the way now perhaps he would have a guide i have two others waiting she said a british gunner and a canadian pilot they are in a farmhouse in the hills when are you planning to go across tonight she said dont drink too much wine she went away again and returned half an hour later carrying an old ripped brown overcoat for him its cold where were going she explained they slipped out of the kitchen door and threaded their way through the small town by starlight leaving the houses behind they followed a dirt track steadily uphill after an hour they came to a small group of stone buildings teresa whistled then opened the door to a barn and two men came out we always use false names she said in english i am maria and these two are fred and tom our new friend is leandro the men shook hands she went on no talking no smoking and anyone who falls behind will be left are we ready from here the path was steeper lloyd found himself slipping on stones now and again he clutched at stunted bushes of heather beside the path and pulled himself upwards with their aid the petite teresa set a pace that soon had the three men puffing and blowing she was carrying a flashlight but she refused to use it while the stars were bright saying she had to conserve the battery the air got colder they waded across an icy stream and lloyds feet did not get warm again afterwards an hour later teresa said take care to stay in the middle of the path here lloyd looked down and realized he was on a ridge between steep slopes when he saw how far he could fall he felt a little giddy and quickly looked up and ahead at teresas swiftly moving silhouette in normal circumstances he would have enjoyed every minute of walking behind a figure like that but now he was so tired and cold he did not have the energy even to ogle the mountains were not uninhabited at one point a distant dog barked at another they heard a tinkling of eerie bells which spooked the men until teresa explained that mountain shepherds hung bells on their sheep so that they could find their flocks lloyd thought about daisy was she still at tŷ gwyn or had she gone back to her husband lloyd hoped she had not returned to london for london was being bombed every night the french newspapers said was she alive or dead would he ever see her again if he did how would she feel about him they stopped every two hours to rest drink water and take a few mouthfuls from a bottle of wine teresa was carrying it started to rain around dawn the ground underfoot instantly became treacherous and they all stumbled and slipped but teresa did not slow down be glad its not snow she said daylight revealed a landscape of scrubby vegetation in which rocky outcrops stuck up like tombstones the rain continued and a cold mist obscured the distance after a while lloyd realized they were walking downhill at the next rest stop teresa announced we are now in spain lloyd should have been relieved but he just felt exhausted gradually the landscape softened rocks giving way to coarse grass and shrubs suddenly teresa dropped to the ground and lay flat the three men instantly did the same not needing to be prompted following teresas gaze lloyd saw two men in green uniforms and peculiar hats spanish border guards presumably he realized that being in spain did not mean he was out of trouble if he was caught entering the country illegally he might just be sent back worse he could disappear into one of francos prison camps the border guards were walking along a mountain track towards the fugitives lloyd prepared himself for a fight he would have to move fast in order to overcome them before they could draw their guns he wondered how good the other two men would be in a fracas but his trepidation was unnecessary the two guards reached some unmarked boundary and then turned back teresa acted as if she had known this would happen when the guards disappeared from sight she stood up and the four of them walked on soon afterwards the mist lifted lloyd saw a fishing village around a sandy bay he had been here before when he came to spain in he even remembered that there was a railway station they walked into the village it was a sleepy place with no signs of officialdom no police no town hall no soldiers no checkpoints doubtless that was why teresa had chosen it they went to the station and teresa bought tickets flirting with the vendor as if they were old friends lloyd sat on a bench on the shady platform footsore weary grateful and happy an hour later they caught a train to barcelona v daisy had never before understood the meaning of work or tiredness or tragedy she sat in a school classroom drinking sweet english tea out of a cup with no saucer she wore a steel helmet and rubber boots it was five oclock in the afternoon and she was still weary from the night before she was part of the aldgate district air raid precautions sector theoretically she worked an eighthour shift followed by eight hours on standby and eight hours off duty in practice she worked as long as the air raid continued and there were wounded people to be driven to hospital london was bombed every single night of october daisy always worked with one other woman the drivers attendant and four men forming a firstaid party their headquarters was in a school and now they were sitting at the childrens desks waiting for the planes to come and the sirens to wail and the bombs to fall the ambulance she drove was a converted american buick they also had a normal car and driver to transport what they called sitting cases injured people who could nevertheless sit upright without assistance while being transported to hospital her attendant was naomi avery an attractive blonde cockney who liked men and enjoyed the camaraderie of the team now she bantered with the post warden nobby clarke a retired policeman the chief warden is a man she said the district warden is a man youre a man i hope so nobby said and the others chuckled there are plenty of women in arp naomi went on how come none of them are officials the men laughed a bald man with a big nose called gorgeous george said here we go womens rights again he had a misogynist streak daisy joined in you dont really think all you men are smarter than all of us women do you nobby said matter of fact there are some women senior wardens ive never met one said naomi its tradition isnt it nobby said women have always been homemakers like catherine the great of russia daisy said sarcastically naomi put in or queen elizabeth of england amelia earhart jane austen marie curie the only scientist ever to win the nobel prize twice catherine the great said gorgeous george isnt there a story about her and her horse now now ladies present said nobby in a tone of reproof anyway i can answer daisys question he went on daisy willing to be his foil said go on then i grant you that some women may be just as clever as a man he said with the air of one who makes a remarkably generous concession but there is one very good reason why almost all arp officials are men nevertheless and what would that reason be nobby its very simple men wont take orders from a woman he sat back with a triumphant expression confident that he had won the argument the irony was that when the bombs were falling and they were digging through the rubble to rescue the injured they were equals there was no hierarchy then if daisy shouted at nobby to pick up the other end of a roof beam he would do it without demur daisy loved these men even george they would give their lives for her and she for them she heard a low hooting sound outside slowly it rose in pitch until it became the tiresomely familiar siren of an air raid warning seconds later there was the boom of a distant explosion the warning was often late sometimes it sounded after the first bombs had fallen the phone rang and nobby picked it up they all stood up george said wearily dont the germans ever take a ruddy day off nobby put the phone down and said nutley street i know where that is said naomi as they all hurried out our mp lives there they jumped into the cars as daisy put the ambulance in gear and drove off naomi sitting beside her said happy days naomi was being ironic but strangely daisy was happy it was very odd she thought as she careered around a bend every night she saw destruction tragic bereavement and horribly maimed bodies there was a good chance she herself would die in a blazing building tonight yet she felt wonderful she was working and suffering for a cause and paradoxically that was better than pleasing herself she was part of a group that would risk everything to help others and it was the best feeling in the world daisy did not hate the germans for trying to kill her she had been told by her fatherinlaw earl fitzherbert why they were bombing london until august the luftwaffe had raided only ports and airfields fitz had explained in an unusually candid moment that the british were not so scrupulous the government had approved bombing of targets in german cities back in may and all through june and july the raf had dropped bombs on women and children in their homes the german public had been enraged by this and demanded retaliation the blitz was the result daisy and boy were keeping up appearances but she locked her bedroom door when he was at home and he made no objection their marriage was a sham but they were both too busy to do anything about it when daisy thought about it she felt sad for she had lost both boy and lloyd now fortunately she hardly had time to think nutley street was on fire the luftwaffe dropped incendiary bombs and high explosive together fire did the most damage but the high explosive helped the blaze to spread by blowing out windows and ventilating the flames daisy brought the ambulance to a screeching halt and they all went to work people with minor injuries were helped to the nearest first aid station those more seriously hurt were driven to st barts or the london hospital in whitechapel daisy made one trip after another when darkness fell she switched on her headlights they were masked with only a slit of light as part of the blackout though it seemed a superfluous precaution when london was burning like a bonfire the bombing went on until dawn in full daylight the bombers were too vulnerable to being shot down by the fighter aircraft piloted by boy and his comrades so the air raid petered out as the cold grey light washed over the wreckage daisy and naomi returned to nutley street to find that there were no more victims to be taken to hospital they sat down wearily on the remains of a brick garden wall daisy took off her steel helmet she was filthy dirty and worn out i wonder what the girls in the buffalo yacht club would think of me now she thought then she realized she no longer cared much what they thought the days when their approval was allimportant to her seemed a long time in the past someone said would you like a cup of tea my lovely she recognized the accent as welsh she looked up to see an attractive middleaged woman carrying a tray oh boy thats what i need she said and helped herself she had now grown to like this beverage it tasted bitter but it had a remarkable restorative effect the woman kissed naomi who explained were related her daughter millie is married to my brother abie daisy watched the woman take the tray around the little crowd of arp wardens and firemen and neighbours she must be a local dignitary daisy decided she had an air of authority yet at the same time she was clearly a woman of the people speaking to everyone with an easy warmth making them smile she knew nobby and gorgeous george and greeted them as old friends she took the last cup on the tray for herself and came to sit beside daisy you sound american she said pleasantly daisy nodded im married to an englishman i live in this street but my house escaped the bombs last night im the member of parliament for aldgate my name is eth leckwith daisys heart skipped a beat this was lloyds famous mother she shook hands daisy fitzherbert ethels eyebrows went up oh she said youre the viscountess aberowen daisy blushed and lowered her voice they dont know that in the arp your secret is safe with me hesitantly daisy said i knew your son lloyd she could not help the tears that came to her eyes when she thought of their time at tŷ gwyn and the way he had looked after her when she had miscarried he was very kind to me once when i needed help thank you said ethel but dont talk as if hes dead the reproof was mild but daisy felt she had been dreadfully tactless im so sorry she said hes missing in action i know how frightfully stupid of me but hes not missing any longer ethel said he escaped through spain he arrived home yesterday oh my god daisys heart was racing is he all right perfectly in fact he looks very well despite what hes been through where daisy swallowed where is he now why hes here somewhere ethel looked around lloyd she called daisy scanned the crowd wildly could it be true a man in a ripped brown overcoat turned around and said yes mam daisy stared at him his face was sunburned and he was as thin as a stick but he looked more attractive than ever come here my lovely said ethel lloyd took a step forward then saw daisy suddenly his face was transformed he smiled happily hello he said daisy sprang to her feet ethel said lloyd theres someone here you may remember daisy could not restrain herself she ran to lloyd and threw herself into his arms she hugged him she looked into his green eyes then kissed his brown cheeks and his broken nose and then his mouth i love you lloyd she said madly i love you i love you i love you i love you too daisy he said behind her daisy heard ethels wry voice you do remember i see vi lloyd was eating toast and jam when daisy entered the kitchen of the house in nutley street she sat at the table looking exhausted and took off her steel helmet her face was smudged and her hair was dirty with ash and dust and lloyd thought she looked irresistibly beautiful she came in most mornings when the bombing ended and the last victim had been driven to the hospital lloyds mother had told her she did not need an invitation and daisy had taken her at her word ethel poured daisy a cup of tea and said hard night my lovely daisy nodded grimly one of the worst the peabody building in orange street burned down oh no lloyd was horrified he knew the place a big overcrowded tenement full of poor families with numerous children bernie said thats a big building it was said daisy hundreds of people were burned and god knows how many children are orphans nearly all my patients died on the way to hospital lloyd reached across the little table and took her hand she looked up from her cup of tea you dont get used to it you think youll become hardened but you dont she was stricken with sadness ethel put a hand on her shoulder for a moment in a gesture of compassion daisy said and were doing the same to families in germany ethel said including my old friends maud and walter and their children i presume isnt that terrible daisy shook her head despairingly whats wrong with us lloyd said whats wrong with the human race bernie ever practical said ill go over to orange street later and make sure everythings being done for the children ill come with you said ethel bernie and ethel thought alike and acted together effortlessly often seeming to read each others mind lloyd had been observing them carefully since he got home worrying that their marriage might have been affected by the shocking revelation that ethel had never had a husband called teddy williams and that lloyds father was earl fitzherbert he had discussed this at length with daisy who now knew the whole truth how did bernie feel about having been lied to for twenty years but lloyd saw no sign that it had made any difference in his unsentimental way bernie adored ethel and to him she could do no wrong he believed she would never do anything to hurt him and he was right it made lloyd hope that he too might one day have such a marriage daisy noticed that lloyd was in uniform where are you off to this morning ive had a summons from the war office he looked at the clock on the mantelpiece id better get going i thought youd already been debriefed come to my room and ill explain while im putting on my tie bring your tea they went upstairs daisy looked around with interest and he realized she had not been in his bedroom before he looked at the single bed the bookshelf of novels in german french and spanish and the writing table with the row of sharpened pencils and wondered what she thought of it what a nice little room she said it was not little it was the same size as the other bedrooms in the house but she had different standards she picked up a framed photograph it showed the family at the seaside little lloyd in shorts toddling millie in a swimsuit young ethel in a big floppy hat bernie wearing a grey suit with a white shirt open at the neck and a knotted handkerchief on his head southend lloyd explained he took her cup put it on the dressing table and folded her into his arms he kissed her mouth she kissed him back with weary tenderness stroking his cheek letting her body slump against his after a minute he released her she was really too tired to canoodle and he had an appointment she took off her boots and lay down on his bed the war office have asked me to go in and see them again he said as he tied his tie but you were there for hours last time it was true he had had to dredge his memory for every last detail of his time on the run in france they wanted to know the rank and regiment of every german he had encountered he could not remember them all of course but he had done his homework meticulously on the tŷ gwyn course and he was able to give them a great deal of information that was standard military intelligence debriefing but they had also asked about his escape the roads he had taken and who had helped him they were even interested in maurice and marcelle and reproved him for not knowing their surname they had got very excited about teresa who clearly could be a major asset to future escapers im seeing a different lot today he glanced at a typed note on his dressing table at the metropole hotel in northumberland avenue room four two four the address was off trafalgar square in a neighbourhood of government offices apparently its a new department dealing with british prisoners of war he put on his peaked cap and looked in the mirror am i smart enough there was no answer he looked at the bed she had fallen asleep he pulled a blanket over her kissed her forehead and went out he told his mother that daisy was asleep on his bed and she said she would check on her later to make sure she was all right he took the tube to central london he had told daisy the true story of his parentage disabusing her of the theory that he was mauds child she believed him readily for she suddenly recalled boy telling her that fitz had an illegitimate child somewhere this is creepy she had said looking thoughtful the two englishmen ive fallen for turn out to be halfbrothers she had looked appraisingly at lloyd you inherited your fathers good looks boy just got his selfishness lloyd and daisy had not yet made love one reason was that she never had a night off then on the single occasion they had had a chance to be alone together things had gone wrong it had been last sunday at daisys home in mayfair her servants had sunday afternoon off and she had taken him to her bedroom in the empty house but she had been nervy and ill at ease she had kissed him then turned her head aside when he put his hands on her breasts she had pushed them away he had been confused if he was not supposed to behave this way why were they in her bedroom im sorry she had said at last i love you but i cant do this i cant betray my husband in his own house but he betrayed you at least he went somewhere else all right she had looked at him do you think im being silly he shrugged after all weve been through together this seems overly fastidious of you yes but look you feel the way you feel what a rotter i would be if i tried to bully you into doing it when youre not ready she put her arms around him and hugged him hard i said it before she said youre a grownup dont lets spoil the whole afternoon he said well go to the pictures they saw charlie chaplin in the great dictator and laughed their heads off then she went back on duty pleasant thoughts of daisy occupied lloyd all the way to embankment station then he walked up northumberland avenue to the metropole the hotel had been stripped of its reproduction antiques and furnished with utilitarian tables and chairs after a few minutes wait lloyd was taken to see a tall colonel with a brisk manner ive read your account lieutenant he said well done thank you sir we expect more people to follow in your footsteps and wed like to help them were especially interested in downed airmen theyre expensive to train and we want them back so that they can fly again lloyd thought that was harsh if a man survived a crash landing should he really be asked to risk going through the whole thing again but wounded men were sent back into battle as soon as they recovered that was war the colonel said were setting up a kind of underground railroad all the way from germany to spain you speak german french and spanish i see but more importantly youve been at the sharp end wed like to second you to our department lloyd had not been expecting this and he was not sure how he felt about it thank you sir im honoured but is it a desk job not at all we want you to go back to france lloyds heart raced he had not thought he would have to face those perils again the colonel saw the dismay on his face you know how dangerous it is yes sir in an abrupt tone the colonel said you can refuse if you like lloyd thought of daisy in the blitz and of the people burned to death in the peabody tenement and realized he did not even want to refuse if you think its important sir then i will go back most willingly of course good man said the colonel half an hour later lloyd was dazedly walking back to the tube station he was now part of a department called mi he would return to france with false papers and large sums in cash already dozens of german dutch belgian and french people in occupied territory had been recruited to the deadly dangerous task of helping british and commonwealth airmen return home he would be one of numerous mi agents expanding the network if he were caught he would be tortured although he was scared he was also excited he was going to fly to madrid it would be his first time up in an airplane he would reenter france across the pyrenees and make contact with teresa he would be moving in disguise among the enemy rescuing people under the noses of the gestapo he would make sure that men following in his footsteps would not be as alone and friendless as he had been he got back to nutley street at eleven oclock there was a note from his mother not a peep from miss america after visiting the bomb site ethel would have gone to the house of commons bernie to county hall lloyd and daisy had the house to themselves he went up to his room daisy was still asleep her leather jacket and heavyduty wool trousers were carelessly tossed on the floor she was in his bed wearing only her underwear this had never happened before he took off his jacket and tie a sleepy voice from the bed said and the rest he looked at her what take off your clothes and get into bed the house was empty no one would disturb them he took off his boots trousers shirt and socks then he hesitated youre not going to feel cold she said she wriggled under the blankets then threw a pair of silk camiknickers at him he had expected this to be a solemn moment of high passion but daisy seemed to think it should be a matter of laughter and fun he was willing to be guided by her he took off his vest and pants and slipped into bed beside her she was warm and languid he felt nervous he had never actually told her that he was a virgin he had always heard that the man should take the initiative but it seemed that daisy did not know that she kissed and caressed him then she grasped his penis oh boy she said i was hoping youd have one of these after that he stopped being nervous i on a cold winter sunday carla von ulrich went with the maid ada to visit adas son kurt at the wannsee childrens nursing home by the lake on the western outskirts of berlin it took an hour to get there on the train carla made a habit of wearing her nurses uniform on these visits because the staff at the home talked more frankly about kurt to a fellow professional in summer the lakeside would be crowded with families and children playing on the beach and paddling in the shallows but today there were just a few walkers well wrapped up against the chill and one hardy swimmer with an anxious wife waiting at the waterside the home which specialized in caring for severely handicapped children was a oncegrand house whose elegant reception rooms had been subdivided and painted pale green and furnished with hospital beds and cots kurt was now eight years old he could walk and feed himself about as well as a twoyearold but he could not talk and still wore diapers he had shown no sign of improvement for years however there was no doubt of his joy at seeing ada he beamed with happiness burbled excitedly and held out his arms to be picked up and hugged and kissed he recognized carla too whenever she saw him she remembered the frightening drama of his birth when she had delivered him while her brother erik ran to fetch dr rothmann they played with him for an hour or so he liked toy trains and cars and books with highly coloured pictures then the time for his afternoon nap drew near and ada sang to him until he went to sleep on their way out a nurse spoke to ada frau hempel please come with me to the office of herr professor doctor willrich he would like to speak to you willrich was director of the home carla had never met him and she was not sure ada had either ada said nervously is there some problem the nurse said im sure the director just wants to talk to you about kurts progress ada said fräulein von ulrich will come with me the nurse did not like that idea professor willrich asked only for you but ada could be stubborn when necessary fräulein von ulrich will come with me she repeated firmly the nurse shrugged and said curtly follow me they were shown into a pleasant office this room had not been subdivided a coal fire burned in the grate and a bay window gave a view of the wannsee lake someone was sailing carla saw slicing through the wavelets before a stiff breeze willrich sat behind a leathertopped desk he had a jar of tobacco and a rack of differentshaped pipes he was about fifty tall and heavily built all his features seemed large big nose square jaw huge ears and a domed bald head he looked at ada and said frau hempel i presume ada nodded willrich turned to carla and you are fräulein carla von ulrich professor im kurts godmother he raised his eyebrows a little young to be a godmother surely ada said indignantly she delivered kurt she was only eleven but she was better than the doctor because he wasnt there willrich ignored that still looking at carla he said disdainfully and hoping to become a nurse i see carla wore a beginners uniform but she considered herself to be more than just hopeful i am a trainee nurse she said she did not like willrich please sit he opened a thin file kurt is eight years old but has reached the developmental stage of only two years he paused neither woman said anything this is unsatisfactory he said ada looked at carla carla did not know what he was getting at and indicated as much with a shrug there is a new treatment available for cases of this type however it will necessitate moving kurt to another hospital willrich closed the file he looked at ada and for the first time he smiled im sure you would like kurt to undergo a therapy that might improve his condition carla did not like his smile it seemed creepy she said could you tell us more about the treatment professor im afraid it would be beyond your understanding he said even though you are a trainee nurse carla was not going to let him get away with that im sure frau hempel would like to know whether it would involve surgery or drugs or electricity for example drugs he said with evident reluctance ada said where would he have to go the hospital is in akelberg in bavaria adas geography was weak and carla knew she had no sense of how far that was its two hundred miles she said oh no said ada how would i visit him by train said willrich impatiently carla said it would take four or five hours she would probably have to stay overnight and what about the cost of the fare i cannot concern myself with such things said willrich angrily i am a doctor not a travel agent ada was close to tears if it means kurt will get better and learn to say a few words and not to soil himself one day we might perhaps bring him home exactly said willrich i felt sure you would not wish to deny him the chance of getting better just for your own selfish reasons is that what youre telling us said carla that kurt might be able to live a normal life medicine offers no guarantees he said even a trainee nurse should know that carla had learned from her parents to be impatient with prevarication i dont ask you for a guarantee she said crisply i ask you for a prognosis you must have one otherwise you would not be proposing the treatment he reddened the treatment is new we hope it will improve kurts condition that is what i am telling you is it experimental all medicine is experimental all therapies work on some patients but not on others you must listen to what i tell you medicine offers no guarantees carla wanted to oppose him just because he was so arrogant but she realized that was not the basis on which to make a judgement besides she was not sure that ada really had a choice doctors could go against the wishes of parents if the childs health was at risk in effect they could do what they liked willrich was not asking adas permission he had no real need of it he was speaking to her only in order to avoid a fuss carla said can you tell frau hempel how long it might be before kurt returns from akelberg to berlin quite soon said willrich it was no answer at all but carla felt that if she pressed him he would become angry again ada was looking helpless carla sympathized she herself found it difficult to know what to say they had not been given enough information doctors were often like this carla had noticed they seemed to want to hug their knowledge to themselves they preferred to fob patients off with platitudes and became defensive when questioned ada had tears in her eyes well if theres a chance he could get better thats the attitude willrich said but ada had not finished what do you think carla willrich looked outraged at this appeal to the opinion of a mere nurse carla said i agree with you ada this opportunity must be seized for kurts sake even though it will be hard for you very sensible said willrich and he got to his feet thank you for coming to see me he went to the door and opened it carla felt he could not get rid of them quickly enough they left the home and walked back to the station as their nearly empty train pulled away carla picked up a leaflet that had been left on the seat it was headed how to oppose the nazis and it listed ten things people could do to hasten the end of the regime starting with slowing down their rate of work carla had seen such flyers before though not often they were placed by some underground resistance movement ada snatched it from her crumpled it and threw it out of the window you can be arrested for reading such things she said she had been carlas nanny and sometimes she behaved as though carla had not grown up carla did not mind her occasional bossiness for she knew it came from love however in this case ada was not overreacting people could be imprisoned not just for reading such things but even for failing to report that they had found one ada could be in trouble merely for throwing it out of the window fortunately there was no one else in the carriage to see what she had done ada was still troubled by what she had been told at the home do you think we did the right thing she said to carla i dont really know carla said candidly i think so youre a nurse you understand these things better than i do carla was enjoying nursing though she still felt frustrated that she had not been allowed to train as a doctor now with so many young men in the army the attitude to female medical students had changed and more women were going to medical school carla could have applied again for a scholarship except that her family was so desperately poor that they depended on her meagre wages her father had no work at all her mother gave piano lessons and erik sent home as much as he could afford out of his army pay the family had not paid ada for years ada was a naturally stoical person and by the time they got home she was getting over her upset she went into the kitchen put on her apron and began to prepare dinner for the family and the comfortable routine seemed to console her carla was not having dinner she had plans for the evening she felt she was abandoning ada to her sadness and she was a bit guilty but not guilty enough to sacrifice her night out she put on a kneelength tennis dress she had made herself by shortening the frayed hem of an old frock of her mothers she was not going to play tennis she was going to dance and her aim was to look american she put on lipstick and face powder and combed out her hair in defiance of the governments preference for braids the mirror showed her a modern girl with a pretty face and a defiant air she knew that her confidence and selfpossession put a lot of boys off her sometimes she wished she could be seductive as well as capable a trick her mother had always been able to pull off but it was not in her nature she had long ago given up trying to be winsome it just made her feel silly boys had to accept her as she was some boys were scared of her but others were attracted and at parties she often ended up with a small cluster of admirers she in turn liked boys especially when they forgot about trying to impress people and started to talk normally her favourites were the ones who made her laugh so far she had not had a serious boyfriend though she had kissed quite a few to complete her outfit she put on a striped blazer she had bought from a secondhand clothing cart she knew her parents would disapprove of her appearance and try to make her change saying it was dangerous to defy the nazis prejudices so she needed to get out of the house without seeing them it should be easy enough mother was giving a piano lesson carla could hear the painfully hesitant playing of her pupil father would be reading the newspaper in the same room for they could not afford to heat more than one room of the house erik was away with the army though he was now stationed near berlin and due home on leave shortly she covered up with a conventional raincoat and put her white shoes in her pocket she went down to the hall opened the front door shouted goodbye back soon and hurried out she met frieda at the friedrich strasse station she was dressed similarly with a stripey dress under a plain tan coat her hair hanging loose the main difference being that friedas clothes were new and expensive on the platform two boys in hitler youth outfits stared at them with a mixture of disapproval and desire they got off the train in the northern suburb of wedding a workingclass district that had once been a leftwing stronghold they headed for the pharus hall where in the past communists had held their conferences now there was no political activity at all of course nevertheless the building had become the centre of the movement called swing kids kids of between fifteen and twentyfive were already gathering in the streets around the hall swing boys wore check jackets and carried umbrellas to look english they let their hair grow long to show their contempt for the military swing girls had heavy makeup and american sports clothes they all thought the hitler youth were stupid and boring with their folk music and community dances carla thought it was ironic when she was little she had been teased by the other kids and called a foreigner because her mother was english now the same children a little older thought english was the fashionable thing to be carla and frieda went into the hall there was a conventional innocent youth club there with girls in pleated skirts and boys in short trousers playing table tennis and drinking sticky orange cordial but the action was in the side rooms frieda quickly led carla to a large storeroom with stacked chairs around the walls there her brother werner had plugged in a record player fifty or sixty boys and girls were dancing the jitterbug jive carla recognized the tune that was playing ma hes making eyes at me she and frieda started to dance jazz records were banned because most of the best musicians were negroes the nazis had to denigrate anything that was done well by nonaryans it threatened their theories of superiority unfortunately for them germans loved jazz just as much as everyone else people who visited other countries brought records home and you could buy them from american sailors in hamburg there was a lively black market werner had lots of discs of course he had everything a car modern clothes cigarettes money he was still carlas dream boy though he always went for girls older than she women really everyone assumed he went to bed with them carla was a virgin werners earnest friend heinrich von kessel immediately came up to them and started to dance with frieda he wore a black jacket and waistcoat which looked dramatic with his longish dark hair he was devoted to frieda she liked him she enjoyed talking to clever men but she would not go out with him because he was too old twentyfive or twentysix soon a boy carla did not know came and danced with her and the evening was off to a good start she abandoned herself to the music the irresistible sexual drumbeat the suggestively crooned lyrics the exhilarating trumpet solos the joyous flight of the clarinet she whirled and kicked let her skirt flare outrageously high fell into the arms of her partner and sprang out again when they had danced for an hour or so werner put on a slow tune frieda and heinrich began dancing cheek to cheek there was no one available whom carla liked enough for slow dancing so she left the room and went to get a coke germany was not at war with america so cocacola syrup was imported and bottled in germany to her surprise werner followed her out leaving someone else to put on records for a while she was flattered that the most attractive man in the room wanted to talk to her she told him about kurt being moved to akelberg and werner said the same thing had happened to his brother axel who was fifteen axel had been born with spina bifida could the same treatment work for both of them he said with a frown i doubt it but i dont really know carla said why is it that medical men never explain what theyre doing werner said irritably she laughed humourlessly they think that if ordinary people understand medicine they wont heroworship doctors any longer same principle as a conjurer its more impressive if you dont know how its done said werner doctors are as egocentric as anyone else more so said carla as a nurse i know she told him about the leaflet she had read on the train werner said how did you feel about it carla hesitated it was dangerous to speak honestly about such things but she had known werner all her life he had always been leftwing and he was a swing kid she could trust him she said im pleased someone is opposing the nazis it shows that not all germans are paralysed by fear there are lots of things you can do against the nazis he said quietly not just wearing lipstick she assumed he meant she could distribute such leaflets could he be involved in such activity no he was too much of a playboy heinrich might be different he was very intense no thanks she said im too scared they finished their cokes and returned to the storeroom it was packed now with hardly room enough to dance to carlas surprise werner asked her for the last dance he put on bing crosby singing only forever carla was thrilled he held her close and they swayed rather than danced to the slow ballad at the end by tradition someone turned off the light for a minute so that couples could kiss carla was embarrassed she had known werner since they were children but she had always been attracted to him and now she turned her face up eagerly as she had expected he kissed her expertly and she returned the kiss with enthusiasm to her delight she felt his hand gently grasp her breast she encouraged him by opening her mouth then the light came on and it was all over well she said breathlessly that was a surprise he gave his most charming smile perhaps i can surprise you again some time ii carla was passing through the hall on her way to the kitchen for breakfast when the phone rang she picked up the handset carla von ulrich she heard friedas voice oh carla my little brothers dead what carla could hardly believe it frieda im so sorry where did it happen in that hospital frieda was sobbing carla recalled werner telling her that axel had been sent to the same akelberg hospital as kurt how did he die appendicitis thats terrible carla was sad for her friend but also suspicious she had had a bad feeling when professor willrich spoke to them a month ago about the new treatment for kurt had it been more experimental than he had let on could it have actually been dangerous do you know any more we just got a short letter my father is enraged he phoned the hospital but he wasnt able to speak to the senior people ill come round to your house ill be there in a few minutes thanks carla hung up and went into the kitchen axel franck has died at that hospital in akelberg she said her father walter was looking at the morning post oh he said poor monika carla recalled that axels mother monika franck had once been in love with walter according to family legend the look of concern on walters face was so pained that carla wondered if he had had a slight tendresse for monika despite being in love with maud how complicated love was carlas mother who was now monikas best friend said she must be devastated walter looked down at the post again and said in a tone of surprise heres a letter for ada the room went quiet carla stared at the white envelope as ada took it from walter ada did not receive many letters erik was home it was the last day of his short leave so there were four people watching as ada opened the envelope carla held her breath ada drew out a typed letter on headed paper she read the message quickly gasped then screamed no said carla it cant be maud jumped up and put her arms around ada walter took the letter from adas fingers and read it oh dear how terribly sad he said poor little kurt he put the paper down on the breakfast table ada began to sob my little boy my dear little boy and he died without his mother i cant bear it carla fought back tears she felt bewildered axel and kurt she said at the same time she picked up the letter it was printed with the name of the hospital and its address in akelberg it read dear mrs hempel i regret to inform you of the sad death of your son kurt walter hempel age eight years he passed away on april at this hospital as a result of a burst appendix everything possible was done for him but to no avail please accept my deepest condolences it was signed by the senior physician carla looked up her mother was sitting next to ada arm around her holding her hand as she sobbed carla was griefstricken but more alert than ada she spoke to her father in a shaky voice theres something wrong what makes you say that look again she handed him the letter appendicitis what is the significance kurt had had his appendix removed i remember her father said he had an emergency operation just after his sixth birthday carlas sorrow was mixed with angry suspicion had kurt been killed by a dangerous experiment which the hospital was now trying to cover up why would they lie she said erik banged his fist on the table why do you say it is a lie he cried why do you always accuse the establishment this is obviously a mistake some typist has made a copying error carla was not so sure a typist working in a hospital is likely to know what an appendix is erik said furiously you will seize upon even this personal tragedy as a way of attacking those in authority be quiet you two said their father they looked at him there was a new tone in his voice erik may be right he said if so the hospital will be perfectly happy to answer questions and give further details of how kurt and axel died of course they will said erik walter went on and if carla is right they will try to discourage inquiries withhold information and intimidate the parents of the dead children by suggesting that their questions are somehow illegitimate erik looked less comfortable about that half an hour ago walter had been a shrunken man now somehow he seemed to fill his suit again we will find out as soon as we start asking questions carla said im going to see frieda her mother said dont you have to go to work im on the late shift carla phoned frieda told her that kurt was dead too and said she was coming to talk about it she put on her coat hat and gloves then wheeled her bicycle outside she was a fast rider and it took her only a quarter of an hour to get to the francks villa in schöneberg the butler let her in and told her the family were still in the dining room as soon as she walked in friedas father ludwig franck bellowed at her what did they tell you at the wannsee childrens home carla did not much like ludwig he was a rightwing bully and he had supported the nazis in the early days perhaps he had changed his views many businessmen had by now though they showed little sign of the humility that ought to go with having been so wrong she did not answer immediately she sat down at the table and looked at the family ludwig monika werner and frieda and the butler hovering in the background she collected her thoughts come on girl answer me ludwig demanded he had in his hand a letter that looked very like adas and he was waving it angrily monika put a restraining hand on her husbands arm take it easy ludi i want to know he said carla looked at his pink face and little black moustache he was in an agony of grief she saw in other circumstances she would have refused to speak to someone so rude but he had an excuse for his bad manners and she decided to overlook them the director professor willrich told us there was a new treatment for kurts condition the same as he told us said ludwig what kind of treatment i asked him that question he said i would not be able to understand it i persisted and he said it involved drugs but he did not give any further information may i see your letter herr franck ludwigs expression said he was the one who should be asking questions but he handed the sheet of paper to carla it was exactly the same as adas and carla had a queer feeling that the typist had done several of them just changing the names franck said how can two boys have died of appendicitis at the same time its not a contagious illness carla said kurt certainly did not die of appendicitis for he had no appendix it was removed two years ago right said ludwig thats enough talk he snatched the letter from carlas hand im going to see someone in the government about this he went out monika followed him and so did the butler carla went over to frieda and took her hand im so sorry she said thank you frieda whispered carla went to werner he stood up and put his arms around her she felt a tear fall on her forehead she was gripped by she did not know what intense emotion her heart was full of grief yet she thrilled to the pressure of his body against hers and the gentle touch of his hands after a long moment werner stepped back he said angrily my father has phoned the hospital twice the second time they told him they had no more information and hung up on him but im going to find out what happened to my brother and i wont be brushed off frieda said finding out wont bring him back i still want to know if necessary ill go to akelberg carla said i wonder if theres anyone in berlin who could help us it would have to be someone in the government werner said frieda said heinrichs father is in the government werner snapped his fingers the very man he used to belong to the centre party but hes a nazi now and something important in the foreign office carla said will heinrich take us to see him he will if frieda asks him said werner heinrich will do anything for frieda carla could believe that heinrich had always been intense about everything he did ill phone him now said frieda she went into the hall and carla and werner sat down side by side he put his arm around her and she leaned her head on his shoulder she did not know whether these signs of affection were merely a sideeffect of the tragedy or something more frieda came back in and said heinrichs father will see us right away if we go over there now they all got into werners sports car squeezing on to the front seat i dont know how you keep this car going frieda said as he pulled away even father cant get petrol for private use i tell my boss its for official business he said werner worked for an important general but i dont know how much longer i can get away with it the von kessel family lived in the same suburb werner drove there in five minutes the house was luxurious though smaller than the francks heinrich met them at the door and showed them into a living room with leatherbound books and an old german woodcarving of an eagle frieda kissed him thank you for doing this she said it probably wasnt easy i know you dont get on so well with your father heinrich beamed with pleasure his mother brought them coffee and cake she seemed a warm simple person when she had served them she left like a maid heinrichs father gottfried came in he had the same thick straight hair but it was silver instead of black heinrich said father here are werner and frieda franck whose father manufactures peoples radios ah yes said gottfried i have seen your father in the herrenklub and this is carla von ulrich i believe you know her father too we were colleagues at the german embassy in london gottfried said carefully that was in clearly he was not so pleased to be reminded of his association with a social democrat he took a piece of cake clumsily dropped it on the rug tried ineffectually to pick up the crumbs then abandoned the effort and sat back carla thought what is he afraid of heinrich got straight down to the purpose of the visit father i expect youve heard of akelberg carla was watching gottfried closely there was a splitsecond flash of something in his expression but he quickly adopted a pose of indifference a small town in bavaria he said there is a hospital there said heinrich for mentally handicapped people i dont think i was aware of that we think something strange is going on there and we wondered if you might know about it i certainly dont what seems to be happening werner broke in my brother died there apparently of appendicitis herr von ulrichs maids child died at the same time in the same hospital of the same illness very sad but a coincidence surely carla said my maids child did not have an appendix it was removed two years ago i understand why you are keen to ascertain the facts said gottfried this is deeply unsatisfactory however the likeliest explanation would seem to be clerical error werner said if so we would like to know of course have you written to the hospital carla said i wrote to ask when my maid could visit her son they never replied werner said my father telephoned the hospital this morning the senior physician slammed the phone down on him oh dear such bad manners but you know this is hardly a foreign office matter werner leaned forward herr von kessel is it possible that both boys were involved in a secret experiment that went wrong gottfried sat back quite impossible he said and carla had a feeling he was telling the truth that is definitely not happening he sounded relieved werner looked as if he had run out of questions but carla was not satisfied she wondered why gottfried seemed so happy about the assurance he had just given was it because he was concealing something worse she was struck by a possibility so appalling that she could hardly contemplate it gottfried said well if thats all carla said youre very sure sir that they were not killed by an experimental therapy that went wrong very sure to know for certain that is not true you must have some knowledge of what is being done at akelberg not necessarily he said but all his tension had returned and she knew she was on to something i remember seeing a nazi poster she went on it was this memory that had triggered her dreadful thought there was a picture of a male nurse and a mentally handicapped man the text said something like sixty thousand reichsmarks is what this person suffering from hereditary defects costs the peoples community during his lifetime comrade that is your money too it was an advertisement for a magazine i think i have seen some of that propaganda gottfried said disdainfully as if it were nothing to do with him carla stood up youre a catholic herr von kessel and you brought up heinrich in the catholic faith gottfried made a scornful noise heinrich says hes an atheist now but youre not and you believe that human life is sacred yes you say that the doctors at akelberg are not testing dangerous new therapies on handicapped people and i believe you thank you but are they doing something else something worse no no are they deliberately killing the handicapped gottfried shook his head silently carla moved closer to gottfried and lowered her voice as if they were the only two people in the room as a catholic who believes that human life is sacred will you put your hand on your heart and tell me that mentally ill children are not being murdered at akelberg gottfried smiled made a reassuring gesture and opened his mouth to speak but no words came out carla knelt on the rug in front of him would you do that please right now here in your house with you are four young germans your son and his three friends just tell us the truth look me in the eye and say that our government does not kill handicapped children the silence in the room was total gottfried seemed about to speak but changed his mind he squeezed his eyes shut twisted his mouth into a grimace and bowed his head the four young people watched his facial contortions in amazement at last he opened his eyes he looked at them one by one ending with his gaze on his son then he stood up and walked out of the room iii the next day werner said to carla this is awful weve talked of the same thing for more than twentyfour hours well go mad if we dont do something else lets see a movie they went to the kurfürstendamm a street of theatres and shops always called the kudamm most of the good german filmmakers had gone to hollywood years ago and the domestic movies were now secondrate they saw three soldiers set during the invasion of france the three soldiers were a tough nazi sergeant a snivelling complainer who looked a bit jewish and an earnest young man the earnest one asked naive questions such as do the jews really do us any harm and in answer received long stern lectures from the sergeant when battle was joined the sniveller admitted to being a communist deserted and was blown up in an air raid the earnest young man fought bravely was promoted to sergeant and became an admirer of the führer the script was dire but the battle scenes were exciting werner held carlas hand all the way through she hoped he would kiss her in the dark but he did not as the lights came up he said well it was terrible but it took my mind off things for a couple of hours they went outside and found his car shall we go for a drive he said it could be our last chance this car goes up on blocks next week he drove out to the grunewald on the way carlas thoughts inevitably returned to yesterdays conversation with gottfried von kessel no matter how many times she went over it in her mind there was no way she could escape the terrible conclusion all four of them had reached at the end of it kurt and axel had not been accidental victims of a dangerous medical experiment as she had at first thought gottfried had denied that convincingly but he had not been able to bring himself to deny that the government was deliberately killing the handicapped and lying to their families about it it was hard to believe even of people as ruthless and brutal as the nazis yet gottfrieds response had been the clearest example of guilty behaviour that carla had ever witnessed when they were in the forest werner pulled off the road and drove along a track until the car was hidden by shrubbery carla guessed he had brought other girls to this spot he turned out the lights and they were in deep darkness im going to speak to general dorn he said dorn was his boss an important officer in the air force what about you my father says theres no political opposition left but the churches are still strong no one who is sincere about their religious beliefs could condone whats being done are you religious werner asked not really my father is for him the protestant faith is part of the german heritage he loves mother goes to church with him though i suspect her theology might be a bit unorthodox i believe in god but i cant imagine he cares whether people are protestant or catholic or muslim or buddhist and i like singing hymns werners voice fell to a whisper i cant believe in a god who allows the nazis to murder children i dont blame you what is your father going to do speak to the pastor of our church good they were silent for a while he put his arm around her is this all right he said in a halfwhisper she was tense with anticipation and her voice seemed to fail her reply came out as a grunt she tried again and managed to say if it stops you feeling so sad yes then he kissed her she kissed him back eagerly he stroked her hair then her breasts at this point she knew a lot of girls would call a halt they said if you went any further you would lose control of yourself carla decided to risk it she touched his cheek while he was kissing her she caressed his throat with her fingertips enjoying the feel of the warm skin she put her hand under his jacket and explored his body her hand on his shoulder blades and his ribs and his spine she sighed when she felt his hand on her thigh under her skirt as soon as he touched her between her legs she parted her knees girls said a boy would think you cheap for doing that but she could not help herself he touched her in just the right place he did not try to put his hand inside her underwear but stroked her lightly through the cotton she heard herself making noises in her throat quietly at first but then louder eventually she cried out with pleasure burying her face in his neck to muffle the sound then she had to push his hand away because she felt too sensitive she was panting as she began to get her breath back she kissed his neck he touched her cheek lovingly after a minute she said can i do something for you only if you want to she was embarrassed by how much she wanted to the only thing is ive never i know he said ill show you iv pastor ochs was a portly comfortable clergyman with a large house a nice wife and five children and carla feared he would refuse to get involved but she underestimated him he had already heard rumours that were troubling his conscience and he agreed to go with walter to the wannsee childrens home professor willrich could hardly refuse a visit from an interested clergyman they decided to take carla with them because she had witnessed the interview with ada the director might find it more difficult to change his story in front of her on the train ochs suggested he should do the talking the director is probably a nazi he said most people in senior jobs nowadays were party members he will naturally see a former socialdemocrat deputy as an enemy i will play the role of unbiased arbitrator that way i believe we may learn more carla was not sure about that she felt her father would be a more expert questioner but walter went along with the pastors suggestion it was spring and the weather was warmer than on carlas last visit there were boats on the lake carla decided to ask werner to come out here for a picnic she wanted to make the most of him before he drifted off to another girl professor willrich had a fire blazing but a window was open letting in a fresh breeze off the water the director shook hands with pastor ochs and walter he gave carla a brief glance of recognition then ignored her he invited them to sit down but carla saw there was angry hostility behind his superficial courtesy clearly he did not relish being questioned he picked up one of his pipes and played with it nervously he was less arrogant today confronted by two mature men rather than a couple of young women ochs opened the discussion herr von ulrich and others in my congregation are concerned professor willrich about the mysterious deaths of several handicapped children known to them no children have died mysteriously here willrich shot back in fact no child has died here in the last two years ochs turned to walter i find that very reassuring walter dont you yes said walter carla did not but she kept her mouth shut for the moment ochs went on unctuously i feel sure that you give your charges the best possible care yes willrich looked a little less anxious but you do send children from here to other hospitals of course if another institution can offer a child some treatment not available here and when a child is transferred i suppose you are not necessarily kept informed about his treatment or his condition thereafter exactly unless they come back willrich said nothing have any come back no ochs shrugged then you cannot be expected to know what happened to them precisely ochs sat back and spread his hands in a gesture of openness so you have nothing to hide nothing at all some of those transferred children have died willrich said nothing ochs gently persisted thats true isnt it i cannot answer you with any certain knowledge herr pastor ah said ochs because even if one of those children died you would not be notified as we said before forgive me the repetition but i simply want to establish beyond doubt that you cannot be asked to shed light on those deaths not at all once again ochs turned to walter i think were clearing matters up splendidly walter nodded carla wanted to say nothing has been cleared up but ochs was speaking again approximately how many children have you transferred in say the last twelve months ten said willrich exactly he smiled complacently we scientific men prefer not to deal in approximations ten patients out of today we have one hundred and seven children here a very small proportion said ochs carla was getting angry ochs was obviously on willrichs side why was her father swallowing this ochs said and did those children suffer from one common condition or a variety a variety willrich opened a folder on his desk idiocy downs syndrome microcephaly hydrocephaly malformations of limbs head and spinal column and paralysis these are the types of patient you were instructed to send to akelberg that was a jump it was the first mention of akelberg and the first suggestion that willrich had received instructions from a higher authority perhaps ochs was more subtle than he had seemed willrich opened his mouth to say something but ochs forestalled him with another question were they all to receive the same special treatment willrich smiled again i was not informed so i cannot tell you you simply complied with my instructions yes ochs smiled youre a judicious man you choose your words carefully were the children all ages initially the programme was restricted to children under three but later it was expanded to benefit all ages yes carla noted the mention of a programme that had not been admitted before she began to realize that ochs was cleverer than he might at first appear ochs spoke his next sentence as if confirming something already stated and all handicapped jewish children were included irrespective of their particular disability there was a moment of silence willrich looked shocked carla wondered how ochs knew that about jewish children perhaps he did not he might have been guessing after a pause ochs added jewish children and those of mixed race i should have said willrich did not speak but gave a slight nod ochs went on its unusual in this day and age for jewish children to be given preference isnt it willrich looked away the pastor stood up and when he spoke again his voice rang with anger you have told me that ten children suffering from a range of illnesses who could not possibly all benefit from the same treatment were sent away to a special hospital from which they never returned and that jews got priority what did you think happened to them herr professor doctor willrich in gods name what did you think willrich looked as if he would cry you may say nothing of course ochs said more quietly but one day you will be asked the same question by a higher authority in fact by the highest of all authorities he stretched out his arm and pointed a condemning finger and on that day my son you will answer with that he turned around and left the room carla and walter followed him out v inspector thomas macke smiled sometimes the enemies of the state did his job for him instead of working in secret and hiding away where they were difficult to find they identified themselves to him and generously provided irrefutable evidence of their crimes they were like fish that did not require bait and a hook but simply jumped out of the river into the fishermans basket and begged to be fried pastor ochs was one such macke read his letter again it was addressed to the justice minister franz gürtner dear minister is the government killing handicapped children i ask you this question bluntly because i must have a plain answer what a fool if the answer was no this was a criminal libel if yes ochs was guilty of revealing state secrets could he not figure that out for himself after it became impossible to ignore rumours circulating in my congregation i visited the wannsee childrens nursing home and spoke to its director professor willrich his responses were so unsatisfactory that i became convinced something terrible is going on something that is presumably a crime and unquestionably a sin the man had the nerve to write of crimes did it not occur to him that accusing government agencies of illegal acts was itself an illegal act did he imagine he was living in a degenerate liberal democracy macke knew what ochs was complaining about the programme was called aktion t after its address tiergarten strasse the agency was officially the charitable foundation for cure and institutional care though it was supervised by hitlers personal office the chancellery of the führer its job was to arrange the painless deaths of handicapped people who could not survive without costly care it had done splendid work in the last couple of years disposing of tens of thousands of useless people the problem was that german public opinion was not yet sophisticated enough to understand the need for such deaths so the programme had to be kept quiet macke was in on the secret he had been promoted to inspector and had at last been admitted to the nazi partys elite paramilitary schutzstaffel the ss he had been briefed on aktion t when he was assigned to the ochs case he felt proud he was a real insider now unfortunately people had been careless and there was a danger that the secret of aktion t would get out it was mackes job to plug the leak preliminary inquiries had swiftly revealed that there were three men to be silenced pastor ochs walter von ulrich and werner franck franck was the elder son of a radio manufacturer who had been an important early supporter of the nazis the manufacturer himself ludwig franck had initially made furious demands for information about the death of his disabled younger son but had quickly fallen silent after a threat to close his factories young werner a fastrising officer in the air ministry had persisted in asking awkward questions trying to involve his influential boss general dorn the air ministry said to be the largest office building in europe was an ultramodern edifice occupying an entire block of wilhelm strasse just around the corner from gestapo headquarters in prinz albrecht strasse macke walked there in his ss uniform he was able to ignore the guards at the reception desk he barked take me to lieutenant werner franck immediately the receptionist took him up in an elevator and along a corridor to an open door leading into a small office the young man at the desk did not at first look up from the papers in front of him observing him macke guessed he was about twentytwo years old why was he not with a frontline unit bombing england the father had probably pulled strings macke thought resentfully werner looked like a son of privilege tailored uniform gold rings and overlong hair that was distinctly unmilitary macke despised him already werner wrote a note with a pencil then looked up the amiable expression on his face died quickly when he saw the ss uniform and macke noted with interest a flash of fear the boy immediately tried to cover up with a show of bonhomie standing up deferentially and smiling a welcome but macke was not fooled good afternoon inspector said werner please be seated heil hitler said macke heil hitler how can i help you sit down and shut up you foolish boy macke spat werner struggled to hide his fear my goodness what can i have done to incur such wrath dont presume to question me speak when youre spoken to as you wish from this moment on you will ask no further questions about your brother axel macke was surprised to see a momentary look of relief pass over werners face that was puzzling had he been afraid of something else something more frightening than the simple order to stop asking questions about his brother could werner be involved in other subversive activities probably not macke thought on reflection most likely werner was relieved he was not being arrested and taken to the basement in prinz albrecht strasse werner was not yet completely cowed he summoned the nerve to say why should i not ask how my brother died i told you not to question me be aware that you are being treated gently only because your father has been a valued friend of the nazi party were it not for that you would be in my office that was a threat everyone understood im grateful for your forbearance werner said struggling to retain a shred of dignity but i want to know who killed my brother and why you will learn no more regardless of what you do but any further inquiries will be regarded as treason i hardly need to make further inquiries after this visit from you it is now clear that my worst suspicions were right i require you to drop your seditious campaign immediately werner stared defiantly back but said nothing macke said if you do not general dorn will be informed that there are questions about your loyalty werner could be in no doubt about what that meant he would lose his cosy job here in berlin and be dispatched to a barracks on an airstrip in northern france werner looked less defiant more thoughtful macke stood up he had spent enough time here apparently general dorn finds you a capable and intelligent assistant he said if you do the right thing you may continue in that role he left the room he felt edgy and dissatisfied he was not sure he had succeeded in crushing werners will he had sensed a bedrock defiance that remained untouched he turned his mind to pastor ochs a different approach would be required for him macke returned to gestapo headquarters and collected a small team reinhold wagner klaus richter and günther schneider they took a black mercedes d the gestapos favourite car unobtrusive because many berlin taxis were the same model and colour in the early days the gestapo had been encouraged to make themselves visible and let the public see the brutal way they dealt with opposition however the terrorization of the german people had been accomplished long ago and open violence was no longer necessary nowadays the gestapo acted discreetly always with a cloak of legality they drove to ochss house next to the large protestant church in mitte the central district in the same way that werner might think he was protected by his father so ochs probably imagined his church made him safe he was about to learn otherwise macke rang the bell in the old days they would have kicked the door down just for effect a maid opened the door and he walked into a broad welllit hallway with polished floorboards and heavy rugs the other three followed him in where is your master macke said pleasantly to the maid he had not threatened her but all the same she was frightened in his study sir she said and she pointed to a door macke said to wagner get the women and children together in the next room ochs opened the study door and looked into the hall frowning what on earth is going on he said indignantly macke walked directly towards him forcing him to step back and allow macke to enter the room it was a small wellappointed den with a leathertopped desk and shelves of biblical commentaries close the door said macke reluctantly ochs did as he was told then he said youd better have a very good explanation for this intrusion sit down and shut up said macke ochs was dumbfounded probably he had not been told to shut up since he was a boy clergymen were not normally insulted even by policemen but the nazis ignored such enfeebling conventions this is an outrage ochs managed at last then he sat down outside the room a womans voice was raised in protest the wife presumably ochs paled when he heard it and rose from his chair macke pushed him back down stay where you are ochs was a heavy man and taller than macke but he did not resist macke loved to see these pompous types deflated by fear who are you said ochs macke never told them they could guess of course but it was more frightening if they did not know for sure afterwards in the unlikely event that anyone asked questions the whole team would swear that they had begun by identifying themselves as police officers and showing their badges he went out his men were hustling several children into the parlour macke told reinhold wagner to go into the study and keep ochs there then he followed the children into the other room there were flowered curtains family photographs on the mantelpiece and a set of comfortable chairs upholstered in a checked fabric it was a nice home and a nice family why could they not be loyal to the reich and mind their own business the maid was by the window hand over her mouth as if to stop herself crying out four children clustered around ochss wife a plain heavybreasted woman in her thirties she held a fifth child in her arms a girl of about two years with blonde ringlets macke patted the girls head and what is this ones name he said frau ochs was terrified she whispered lieselotte what do you want with us come to uncle thomas little lieselotte said macke holding out his arms no frau ochs cried she clutched the child closer and turned away lieselotte began to cry loudly macke nodded to klaus richter richter grabbed frau ochs from behind pulling her arms back forcing her to let go of the child macke took lieselotte before she fell the child wriggled like a fish but he just held her tighter as he would have held a cat she wailed louder a boy of about twelve flung himself at macke small fists pounding ineffectually it was about time he learned to respect authority macke decided he put lieselotte on his left hip then with his right hand picked the boy up by his shirt front and threw him across the room making sure he landed in an upholstered chair the boy yelled in fear and frau ochs screamed the chair went over backwards and the boy tumbled to the floor he was not really hurt but he began to cry macke took lieselotte out into the hall she screamed at the top of her voice for her mother macke put her down she ran to the parlour door and banged on it screeching in terror she had not yet learned to turn doorknobs macke noted leaving the child in the hallway macke reentered the study wagner was by the door guarding it ochs was standing in the middle of the room white with fear what are you doing to my children he said why is lieselotte screaming you will write a letter macke said yes yes anything ochs said going to the leathertopped desk not now later all right macke was enjoying this ochss collapse was complete unlike werners a letter to the justice minister he went on so thats what this is about you will say you now realize there is no truth in the allegations you made in your first letter you were misled by secret communists you will apologize to the minister for the trouble you have caused by your incautious actions and assure him that you will never again speak of the matter to anyone yes yes i will what are they doing to my wife nothing she is screaming because of what will happen to her if you fail to write the letter i want to see her it will be worse for her if you annoy me with stupid demands of course im sorry i beg your pardon the opponents of nazism were so weak write the letter this evening and mail it in the morning yes should i send you a copy it will come to me anyway you idiot do you think the minister himself reads your insane scribbling no no of course not i see that macke went to door and stay away from people like walter von ulrich i will i promise macke went out beckoning wagner to follow lieselotte was sitting on the floor screaming hysterically macke opened the parlour door and summoned richter and schneider they left the house sometimes violence is quite unnecessary macke said reflectively as they got into the car wagner took the wheel and macke gave him the address of the von ulrich house and then again sometimes its the simplest way he added von ulrich lived in the neighbourhood of the church his house was a spacious old building that he evidently could not afford to maintain the paint was peeling the railings were rusty and a broken window had been patched with cardboard this was not unusual wartime austerity meant that many houses were not kept up the door was opened by a maid macke presumed this was the woman whose handicapped child had started the whole problem but he did not bother to enquire there was no point in arresting girls walter von ulrich stepped into the hall from a side room macke remembered him he was the cousin of the robert von ulrich whose restaurant macke and his brother had bought eight years ago in those days he had been proud and arrogant now he wore a shabby suit but his manner was still bold what do you want he said attempting to sound as if he still had the power to demand explanations macke did not intend to waste much time here cuff him he said wagner stepped forward with the handcuffs a tall handsome woman appeared and stood in front of von ulrich tell me who you are and what you want she demanded she was obviously the wife she had the hint of a foreign accent no surprise there wagner slapped her face hard and she staggered back turn around and put your wrists together wagner said to von ulrich otherwise ill knock her teeth down her throat von ulrich obeyed a pretty young woman dressed in a nurses uniform came rushing down the stairs father she said whats happening macke wondered how many more people there might be in the house he felt a twinge of anxiety an ordinary family could not overcome trained police officers but a crowd of them might create enough of a fracas for von ulrich to slip away however the man himself did not want a fight dont confront them he said to his daughter in a voice of urgency stay back the nurse looked terrified and did as she was told macke said put him in the car wagner walked von ulrich out of the door the wife began to sob the nurse said where are you taking him macke went to the door he looked at the three women the maid the wife and the daughter all this trouble he said for the sake of an eightyearold moron i will never understand you people he went out and got into the car they drove the short distance to prinz albrecht strasse wagner parked at the back of the gestapo headquarters building alongside a dozen identical black cars they all got out they took von ulrich in through a back door and down the stairs to the basement and put him in a whitetiled room macke opened a cupboard and took out three long heavy clubs like american baseball bats he gave one to each of his assistants beat the shit out of him he said and he left them to it vi captain volodya peshkov head of the berlin section of red army intelligence met werner franck at the invalids cemetery beside the berlinspandau ship canal it was a good choice looking around the graveyard carefully volodya was able to confirm that no one followed him or werner in the only other person present was an old woman in a black headscarf and she was on her way out their rendezvous was the tomb of general von scharnhorst a large pedestal bearing a slumbering lion made of melteddown enemy cannons it was a sunny day in spring and the two young spies took off their jackets as they walked among the graves of german heroes after the hitlerstalin pact almost two years ago soviet espionage had continued in germany and so had surveillance of soviet embassy staff everyone saw the treaty as temporary though no one knew how temporary so counterintelligence agents were still tailing volodya everywhere they ought to be able to tell when he was going out on a genuine secret intelligence mission he thought for that was when he shook them off if he went out to buy a frankfurter for lunch he let them shadow him he wondered whether they were smart enough to figure that out have you seen lili markgraf lately said werner she was a girl they had both dated at different times in the past volodya had now recruited her and she had learned to encode and decode messages in the red army intelligence cipher of course volodya would not tell werner that i havent seen her for a while he lied how about you werner shook his head someone else has won my heart he seemed bashful perhaps he was embarrassed about belying his playboy reputation anyway why did you want to see me we have received devastating information volodya said news that will change the course of history if it is true werner looked sceptical volodya went on a source has told us that germany will invade the soviet union in june he thrilled again as he said it it was a huge triumph for red army intelligence and a terrible threat to the ussr werner pushed a lock of hair out of his eyes in a gesture that probably made girls hearts beat faster he said a reliable source it was a journalist in tokyo who was in the confidence of the german ambassador there but was in fact a secret communist everything he had said so far had turned out to be true but volodya could not tell werner that reliable he said so you believe it volodya hesitated that was the problem stalin did not believe it he thought it was allied disinformation intended to sow mistrust between himself and hitler stalins scepticism about this intelligence coup had devastated volodyas superiors souring their jubilation we seek verification he said werner looked around at the trees in the graveyard coming into leaf i hope to god its true he said with sudden savagery it will finish the damned nazis yes said volodya if the red army is prepared werner was surprised are you not prepared once again volodya was not able to tell werner the whole truth stalin believed the germans would not attack before they had defeated the british fearing a war on two fronts while britain continued to defy germany the soviet union was safe he thought in consequence the red army was nowhere near prepared for a german invasion we will be prepared volodya said if you can get me verification of the invasion plan he could not help enjoying a moment of selfimportance his spy could be the key werner said unfortunately i cant help you volodya frowned what do you mean i cant get verification or otherwise of this information nor can i get you anything else im about to be fired from my job at the air ministry ill probably be posted to france or if your intelligence is correct sent to invade the soviet union volodya was horrified werner was his best spy it was werners information that had won volodya promotion to captain he found he could hardly breathe with an effort he said what the hell happened my brother died in a home for the handicapped and the same thing happened to my girlfriends godson and were asking too many questions why would you be demoted for that the nazis are killing off handicapped people but its a secret programme volodya was momentarily diverted from his mission what they just murder them so it seems we dont know the details yet but if they had nothing to hide they wouldnt have punished me and others for asking questions how old was your brother fifteen god still a child theyre not going to get away with it i refuse to shut up they stopped in front of the tomb of manfred von richthofen the air ace it was a huge slab six feet high and twice as wide on it was carved in elegant capital letters the single word richthofen volodya always found its simplicity moving he tried to recover his composure he told himself that the soviet secret police murdered people after all especially anyone suspected of disloyalty the head of the nkvd lavrentiy beria was a torturer whose favourite trick was to have his men pull a couple of pretty girls off the street for him to rape as his evenings entertainment according to rumour but the thought that communists could be as bestial as nazis was no consolation one day he reminded himself the soviets would get rid of beria and his kind then they could begin to build true communism meanwhile the priority was to defeat the nazis they came to the canal wall and stood there watching a barge make its slow progress along the waterway belching oily black smoke volodya mulled over werners alarming confession what would happen if you stopped investigating these deaths of handicapped children he asked id lose my girlfriend werner said shes as angry about it as i am volodya was struck by the scary thought that werner might reveal the truth to his girlfriend you certainly couldnt tell her the real reason for your change of mind he said emphatically werner looked stricken but he did not argue volodya realized that by persuading werner to abandon his campaign he would be helping the nazis hide their crimes he pushed the uncomfortable thought aside but would you be allowed to keep your job with general dorn if you promised to drop the matter yes thats what they want but im not letting them murder my brother then cover it up theyll send me to the front line but i wont shut up what do you think theyll do to you when they realize how determined you are theyll throw me in some camp and what good will that do i just cant lie down for this volodya had to get werner back on side but so far he had failed to get through werner had an answer for everything he was a smart guy that was why he was such a valuable spy what about the others volodya said what others there must be thousands more handicapped adults and children are the nazis going to kill them all probably you certainly wont be able to stop them if youre in a prison camp for the first time werner did not have a comeback volodya turned away from the water and surveyed the cemetery a young man in a suit was kneeling at a small tombstone was he a tail volodya watched carefully the man was shaking with sobs he seemed genuine counterintelligence agents were not good actors look at him volodya said to werner why hes grieving which is what youre doing so what just watch after a minute the man got up wiped his face with a handkerchief and walked away volodya said now hes happy thats what grieving is about it doesnt achieve anything it just makes you feel better you think my asking questions is just to make me feel better volodya turned and looked him in the eye i dont criticize you he said you want to discover the truth and shout it out loud but think about it logically the only way to end this is to bring down the regime and the only way thats going to happen is if the nazis are defeated by the red army maybe werner was weakening volodya perceived with a surge of hope maybe he said who else is there the british are on their knees desperately trying to fight off the luftwaffe the americans are not interested in european squabbles everyone else supports the fascists he put his hands on werners shoulders the red army is your only hope my friend if we lose those nazis will be murdering handicapped children and jews and communists and homosexuals for a thousand more bloodsoaked years hell said werner youre right vii carla and her mother went to church on sunday maud was distraught about walters arrest and desperate to find out where he had been taken of course the gestapo refused to give out any information but pastor ochss church was a fashionable one people came in from the wealthier suburbs to attend and the congregation included some powerful men one or two of whom might be able to make inquiries carla bowed her head and prayed that her father might not be beaten or tortured she did not really believe in prayer but she was desperate enough to try anything she was glad to see the franck family sitting a few rows in front she studied the back of werners head his hair curled a little at the neck in contrast with most of the men who were closecropped she had touched his neck and kissed his throat he was adorable he was easily the nicest boy who had ever kissed her every night before sleeping she relived that evening when they had driven to the grunewald but she was not in love with him she told herself not yet when pastor ochs entered she saw at once that he had been crushed the change in him was horrifying he walked slowly to the lectern head bent and shoulders slumped causing a few in the congregation to exchange concerned whispers he recited the prayers without expression then read the sermon from a book carla had been a nurse for two years now and she recognized in him the symptoms of depression she guessed that he too had received a visit from the gestapo she noticed that frau ochs and the five children were not in their usual places in the front pew as they sang the last hymn carla vowed that she would not give up scared though she was she still had allies frieda and werner and heinrich but what could they do she wished she had solid proof of what the nazis were doing she had no doubts herself that they were exterminating the handicapped this gestapo crackdown made it obvious but she could not convince others without concrete evidence how could she get it after the service she walked out of the church with frieda and werner drawing them away from their parents she said i think we have to get evidence of whats going on frieda immediately saw what she meant we should go to akelberg she said visit the hospital werner had proposed that right at the start but they had decided to begin their inquiries here in berlin now carla considered the idea afresh wed need permits to travel how could we manage that carla snapped her fingers we both belong to the mercury cycling club they can get permits for bicycle holidays it was just the kind of thing the nazis were keen on healthy outdoor exercise for young people could we get inside the hospital we could try werner said i think you should drop the whole thing carla was startled what do you mean pastor ochs has obviously been scared half to death this is a very dangerous business you could be imprisoned tortured and it wont bring back axel or kurt she stared at him incredulously you want us to give it up you must give it up youre talking as if germany were a free country youll get yourselves killed both of you we have to take risks carla said angrily leave me out of this he said ive had a visit from the gestapo too carla was immediately concerned oh werner what happened just threats so far if i ask any more questions ill be sent to the front line oh well thank god its not worse its bad enough the girls were silent for a few moments then frieda said what carla was thinking this is more important than your job you must see that dont tell me what i must see werner replied he was superficially angry but underneath that carla could tell he was in fact ashamed its not your career thats at stake he went on and you havent met the gestapo yet carla was astonished she thought she knew werner she would have been sure he would see this the way she did actually i have met them she said they arrested my father frieda was appalled oh carla she said and put her arm around carlas shoulders we cant find out where he is carla added werner showed no sympathy then you should know better than to defy them he said they would have arrested you too except that inspector macke thinks girls arent dangerous carla wanted to cry she had been on the point of falling in love with werner and now he turned out to be a coward frieda said are you saying you wont help us yes because you want to keep your job its pointless you cant beat them carla was furious with him for his cowardice and defeatism we cant just let this happen open confrontation is insane there are other ways to oppose them carla said how by working slowly like those leaflets say that wont stop them killing handicapped children defying the government is suicidal anything else is cowardice i refused to be judged by two girls with that he stalked off carla fought back tears she could not cry in front of two hundred people standing outside the church in the sunshine i thought he was different she said frieda was upset but baffled too he is different she said ive known him all my life something else is going on something hes not telling us about carlas mother approached she did not notice carlas distress which was unusual nobody knows anything she said despairingly i cant find out where you father might be well keep trying carla said didnt he have friends at the american embassy acquaintances ive asked them already but they havent come up with any information well ask them again tomorrow oh god i suppose there are a million german wives in the same situation as me carla nodded lets go home mother they walked back slowly not talking each with her own thoughts carla was angry with werner the more so because she had badly mistaken his character how could she have fallen for someone so weak they reached their street i shall go to the american embassy in the morning maud said as they approached the house ill wait in the lobby all day if necessary ill beg them to do something if they really want to they can make a semiofficial inquiry about the brotherinlaw of a british government minister oh why is our front door open carlas first thought was that the gestapo had paid them a second visit but there was no black car parked at the kerb and a key was sticking out of the lock maud stepped into the hall and screamed carla rushed in after her there was a man lying on the floor covered in blood carla managed to stop herself screaming who is it she said maud knelt beside the man walter she said oh walter what have they done to you then carla saw that it was her father he was so badly injured he was almost unrecognizable one eye was closed his mouth was swollen into a single huge bruise and his hair was covered with congealed blood one arm was twisted oddly the front of his jacket was stained with vomit maud said walter speak to me speak to me he opened his ruined mouth and groaned carla suppressed the hysterical grief that bubbled up inside her by shifting into professional gear she fetched a cushion and propped up his head she got a cup of water from the kitchen and dribbled a little on his lips he swallowed and opened his mouth for more when he seemed to have had enough she went into his study and got a bottle of schnapps and gave him a few drops he swallowed them and coughed im going for dr rothmann carla said wash his face and give him more water dont try to move him maud said yes yes hurry carla wheeled her bike out of the house and pedalled away dr rothmann was not allowed to practise any longer jews could not be doctors but unofficially he still attended poor people carla pedalled furiously how had her father got home she guessed they had brought him in a car and he had managed to stagger from the kerbside into the house then collapsed she reached the rothmann house like her own home it was in bad repair most of the windows had been broken by jewhaters frau rothmann opened the door my father has been beaten carla said breathlessly the gestapo my husband will come said frau rothmann she turned and called up the stairs isaac the doctor came down its herr von ulrich said frau rothmann the doctor picked up a canvas shopping bag that stood near the door because he was banned from practising medicine carla guessed he could not carry anything that looked like an instrument case they left the house ill cycle on ahead carla said when she got home she found her mother sitting on the doorstep weeping the doctors on his way carla said he is too late said maud your fathers dead viii volodya was outside the wertheim department store just off the alexander platz at half past two in the afternoon he patrolled the area several times looking for men who might be plainclothes police officers he was sure he had not been followed here but it was not impossible that a passing gestapo agent might recognize him and wonder what he was up to a busy place with crowds was the best camouflage but it was not perfect was the invasion story true if so volodya would not be in berlin much longer he would kiss goodbye to gerda and sabine he would presumably return to red army intelligence headquarters in moscow he looked forward to spending some time with his family his sister anya had twin babies whom he had never seen and he felt he could do with a rest undercover work meant continual stress losing gestapo shadows holding clandestine meetings recruiting agents and worrying about betrayal he would welcome a year or two at headquarters assuming the soviet union survived that long alternatively he might be sent on another foreign posting he fancied washington he had always had a yen to see america he took from his pocket a ball of crumpled tissue paper and dropped it into a litter bin at one minute to three he lit a cigarette although he did not smoke he dropped the lighted match carefully into the bin so that it landed in the nest of tissue paper then he walked away seconds later someone cried fire just when everyone in the vicinity was looking at the fire in the litter bin a taxi drew up at the entrance to the store a regular black mercedes d a handsome young man in the uniform of an air force lieutenant jumped out as the lieutenant was paying the driver volodya jumped into the cab and slammed the door on the floor of the cab where the driver could not see it was a copy of neues volk the nazi magazine of racial propaganda volodya picked it up but did not read it some idiot has set fire to a litter bin said the driver adlon hotel volodya said and the car pulled away he riffled the pages of the magazine and verified that a buffcoloured envelope was concealed within he longed to open it but he waited he got out of the cab at the hotel but did not go inside instead he walked through the brandenburg gate and into the park the trees were showing bright new leaves it was a warm spring day and there were plenty of afternoon strollers the magazine seemed to burn the skin of volodyas hand he found an unobtrusive bench and sat down he unfolded the magazine and behind its screen he opened the buffcoloured envelope he drew out a document it was a carbon copy typed and a bit faint but legible it was headed directive no case barbarossa friedrich barbarossa was the german emperor who had led the third crusade in the year the text began the german wehrmacht must be prepared even before the completion of the war against england to overthrow russia in a rapid campaign volodya found himself gasping for breath this was dynamite the tokyo spy had been right and stalin wrong and the soviet union was in mortal danger heart pounding volodya looked at the end of the document it was signed adolf hitler he scanned the pages looking for a date and found one the invasion was scheduled for may next to this was a pencilled note in werner francks handwriting the date has now been changed to june oh my god hes done it volodya said aloud hes confirmed the invasion he put the document back into the envelope and the envelope into the magazine this changed everything he got up from the bench and walked back to the soviet embassy to give them the news ix there was no railway station at akelberg so carla and frieda got off at the nearest stop ten miles away and wheeled their bicycles off the train they wore shorts sweaters and utilitarian sandals and they had put their hair up in plaits they looked like members of the league of german girls the bund deutscher mädel or bdm such girls often took cycling holidays whether they did anything other than cycle especially during the evenings in the spartan hostels at which they stayed was the subject of much speculation boys said bdm stood for bubi drück mir baby do me carla and frieda consulted their map then rode out of town in the direction of akelberg carla thought about her father every hour of every day she knew she would never get over the horror of finding him savagely beaten and dying she had cried for days but alongside her grief was another emotion rage she was not merely going to be sad she was going to do something about it maud distraught with grief had at first tried to persuade carla not to go to akelberg my husband is dead my son is in the army i dont want my daughter to put her life on the line too she had wailed after the funeral when horror and hysteria gave way to a calmer more profound mourning carla had asked her what walter would have wanted maud had thought for a long time it was not until the next day that she answered he would have wanted you to carry on the fight it was hard for maud to say it but they both knew it was true frieda had had no such discussion with her parents her mother monika had once loved walter and was devastated by his death nonetheless she would have been horrified if she knew what frieda was doing her father ludi would have locked her in the cellar but they believed she was going bicycling if anything they might have suspected she was meeting some unsuitable boyfriend the countryside was hilly but they were both in good shape and an hour later they coasted down a slope into the small town of akelberg carla felt apprehensive they were entering enemy territory they went into a café there was no cocacola this isnt berlin said the woman behind the counter with as much indignation as if they had asked to be serenaded by an orchestra carla wondered why someone who disliked strangers would run a café they got glasses of fanta a german product and took the opportunity to refill their water bottles they did not know the precise location of the hospital they needed to ask directions but carla was concerned about arousing suspicion the local nazis might take an interest in strangers asking questions as they were paying carla said were supposed to meet the rest of our group at the crossroads by the hospital which way is that the woman would not meet her eye theres no hospital here the akelberg medical institution carla persisted quoting from the letterhead must be another akelberg carla thought she was lying how strange she said keeping up the pretence i hope were not in the wrong place they wheeled their bikes along the high street there was nothing else for it carla thought she had to ask the way a harmlesslooking old man was sitting on a bench outside a bar enjoying the afternoon sunshine wheres the hospital carla asked him covering her anxiety with a cheery veneer through the town and up the hill on your left he said dont go inside though not many people come out he cackled as if he had made a joke the directions were a bit vague but might suffice carla thought she decided she would not draw further attention by asking again a woman in a headscarf took the arm of the old man pay no attention to him he doesnt know what hes saying she said looking worried she jerked him to his feet and hustled him along the sidewalk keep your mouth shut you old fool she muttered it seemed these people had an inkling of what was going on in their neighbourhood fortunately their main reaction was to act surly and not get involved perhaps they would not be in a hurry to give information to the police or the nazi party carla and frieda went farther along the street and found the youth hostel there were thousands of such places in germany designed to cater for exactly such people as they were pretending to be athletic youngsters on a vigorous openair holiday they checked in the facilities were primitive with threetiered bunk beds but the place was cheap it was late afternoon when they cycled out of town after a mile they came to a left turn there was no signpost but the road led uphill so they took it carlas apprehension intensified the nearer they got the harder it would be to seem innocent under questioning a mile later they saw a large house in a park it did not seem to be walled or fenced and the road led up to the door once again there were no signs unconsciously carla had been expecting a hilltop castle of forbidding grey stone with barred windows and ironbound oak doors but this was a bavarian country house with steep overhanging roofs wooden balconies and a little bell tower surely nothing as horrible as child murder could go on here it also seemed small for a hospital then she saw that a modern extension had been added to one side with a tall chimney they dismounted and leaned their bikes against the side of the building carlas heart was in her mouth as they walked up the steps to the entrance why were there no guards because no one would be so foolhardy as to try to investigate the place there was no bell or knocker but when carla pushed the door it opened she stepped inside and frieda followed they found themselves in a cool hall with a stone floor and bare white walls there were several rooms off the hall but all the doors were closed a middleaged woman in spectacles was coming down a broad staircase she wore a smart grey dress yes she said hello said frieda casually what are you doing you cant come in here frieda and carla had prepared a story i just wanted to visit the place where my brother died frieda said he was fifteen this isnt a public facility the woman said indignantly yes it is frieda had been brought up in a wealthy family and was not cowed by minor functionaries a nurse of about nineteen appeared from a side door and stared at them the woman in the grey dress spoke to her nurse könig fetch herr römer immediately the nurse hurried away the woman said you should have written in advance did you not get my letter said frieda i wrote to the senior physician this was not true frieda was improvising no such letter has been received clearly the woman felt that friedas outrageous request could not possibly have gone unnoticed carla was listening the place was strangely quiet she had dealt with physically and mentally handicapped people adults and children and they were not often silent even through these closed doors she should have been able to hear shouts laughter crying voices raised in protest and nonsensical ravings but there was nothing it was more like a morgue frieda tried a new tack perhaps you can tell me where my brothers grave is id like to visit it there are no graves we have an incinerator she immediately corrected herself a cremation facility carla said i noticed the chimney frieda said what happened to my brothers ashes they will be sent to you in due course dont mix them up with anyone elses will you the womans neck reddened in a blush and carla guessed they did mix up the ashes figuring that no one would know nurse könig reappeared followed by a burly man in the white uniform of a male nurse the woman said ah römer please escort these girls off the premises just a minute said frieda are you quite sure youre doing the right thing i only wanted to see the place where my brother died quite sure then you wont mind letting me know your name there was a seconds hesitation frau schmidt now please leave us römer moved towards them in a menacing way were going frieda said frostily we have no intention of giving herr römer an excuse to molest us the man changed course and opened the door for them they went out climbed on their bikes and rode down the drive frieda said do you think she believed our story totally said carla she didnt even ask our names if she had suspected the truth she would have called the police right away but we didnt learn much we saw the chimney but we didnt find anything we could call proof carla felt a bit down getting evidence was not as easy as it sounded they returned to the hostel they washed and changed and went out in search of something to eat the only café was the one with the grumpy proprietress they ate potato pancakes with sausage afterwards they went to the towns bar they ordered beers and spoke cheerfully to the other customers but no one wanted to talk to them this in itself was suspicious people everywhere were wary of strangers for anyone might be a nazi snitch but even so carla wondered how many towns there were where two young girls could spend an hour in a bar without anyone even trying to flirt with them they returned to the hostel for an early night carla could not think what else to do tomorrow they would return home emptyhanded it seemed incredible that she should know about these awful killings yet be unable to stop them she felt so frustrated she wanted to scream it occurred to her that frau schmidt if that really was her name might have further thoughts about her visitors at the time she had taken carla and frieda for what they claimed to be but she might develop suspicions later and call the police just to be safe if that happened carla and frieda would not be hard to find there were just five people at the hostel tonight and they were the only girls she listened in fear for the fatal knock on the door if they were questioned they would tell part of the truth saying that friedas brother and carlas godson had died at akelberg and they wanted to visit their graves or at least see the place where they died and spend a few minutes in remembrance the local police might buy that story but if they checked with berlin they would swiftly learn the connection with walter von ulrich and werner franck two men who had been investigated by the gestapo for asking disloyal questions about akelberg then carla and frieda would be deep in trouble as they were getting ready to go to bed in the uncomfortablelooking bunks there was a knock at the door carlas heart stopped she thought of what the gestapo had done to her father she knew she could not withstand torture in two minutes she would name every swing kid she knew frieda who was less imaginative said dont look so scared and opened the door it was not the gestapo but a small pretty blonde girl it took carla a moment to recognize her as nurse könig out of uniform i have to speak to you she said she was distressed breathless and tearful frieda invited her in she sat on a bunk bed and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her dress then she said i cant keep it inside any longer carla glanced at frieda they were thinking the same thing carla said keep what inside nurse könig my name is ilse im carla and this is frieda whats on your mind ilse ilse spoke in a voice so low they could hardly hear her she said we kill them carla could hardly breathe she managed to say at the hospital ilse nodded the poor people who come in on the grey buses children even babies and old people grandmothers theyre all more or less helpless sometimes theyre horrid dribbling and soiling themselves but they cant help it and some of them are really sweet and innocent it makes no difference we kill them all how do you do it an injection of morphiumscopolamine carla nodded it was a common anaesthetic fatal in overdose what about the special treatments theyre supposed to have ilse shook her head there are no special treatments carla said ilse let me get this clear do they kill every patient that comes here every one as soon as they arrive within a day no more than two it was what carla had suspected but even so the stark reality was horrifying and she felt nauseated after a minute she said are there any patients there now not alive we were giving injections this afternoon thats why frau schmidt was so frightened when you walked in why dont they make it harder for strangers to get into the building they think guards and barbed wire around a hospital would make it obvious that something sinister was going on anyway no one ever tried to visit before you how many people died today fiftytwo carlas skin crawled the hospital killed fiftytwo people this afternoon around the time we were there yes so theyre all dead now ilse nodded an intention had been germinating in carlas mind and now she resolved to carry it out i want to see she said ilse looked frightened what do you mean i want to go inside the hospital and see those corpses theyre burning them already then i want to see that can you sneak us in tonight right now oh god carla said you dont have to do anything youve already been brave just by talking to us if you dont want to do any more its okay but if were going to put a stop to this we need proof proof yes look the government is ashamed of this project thats why its secret the nazis know that ordinary germans wont tolerate the killing of children but people prefer to believe its not happening and its easy for them to dismiss a rumour especially if they hear it from a young girl so we have to prove it to them i see ilses pretty face took on a look of grim determination all right then ill take you carla stood up how do you normally get there bicycle its outside then well all ride they went out darkness had fallen the sky was partly cloudy and the starlight was faint they used their cycle lights as they rode out of town and up the hill when they came in sight of the hospital they switched off their lights and continued on foot pushing their bikes ilse took them by a forest path that led to the rear of the building carla smelled an unpleasant odour somewhat like a cars exhaust she sniffed ilse whispered the incinerator oh no they hid the bikes in a shrubbery and walked silently to the back door it was unlocked they went in the corridors were bright there were no shadowy corners the place was lit like the hospital it pretended to be if they met someone they would be seen clearly their clothes would give them away immediately as intruders what would they do then run probably ilse walked quickly along a corridor turned a corner and opened a door in here she whispered they walked in frieda let out a squeal of horror and covered her mouth carla whispered oh my soul in a large cold room were about thirty dead people all lying face up on tables naked some were fat some thin some old and withered some children and one baby of about a year a few were bent and twisted but most appeared physically normal each one had a small stickingplaster on the upper left arm where the needle had gone in carla heard frieda crying softly she steeled her nerves where are the others she whispered already gone to the furnace ilse replied they heard voices coming from behind the double door at the far end of the room back outside ilse said they stepped into the corridor carla closed the door all but a crack and peeped through she saw herr römer and another man push a hospital trolley through the doors the men did not look in carlas direction they were arguing about soccer she heard römer say its only nine years ago that we won the national championship we beat eintracht frankfurt twonil yes but half your best players were jews and theyve all gone carla realized they were talking about the bayern munich team römer said the old days will come back if only we play the right tactics still arguing the two men went to a table where a fat woman lay dead they took her by the shoulders and knees then unceremoniously swung her on to the trolley grunting with the effort they moved the trolley to another table and put a second corpse on top of the first when they had three they wheeled the trolley out carla said im going to follow them she crossed the morgue to the double doors and frieda and ilse followed her they passed into an area that felt more industrial than medical the walls were painted brown the floor was concrete and there were store cupboards and tool racks they looked around a corner they saw a large room like a garage with harsh lighting and deep shadows the atmosphere was warm and there was a faint smell of cooking in the middle of the space was a steel box large enough to hold a motor car a metal canopy led from the top of the box through the roof carla realized she was looking at a furnace the two men lifted a body off the trolley and shifted it to a steel conveyor belt römer pushed a button on the wall the belt moved a door opened and the corpse passed into the furnace they put the next corpse on the belt carla had seen enough she turned and motioned the others back frieda bumped into ilse who let out an involuntary cry they all froze they heard römer say what was that a ghost the other replied römers voice was shaky dont joke about such things are you going to pick up the other end of this stiff or what all right all right the three girls hurried back to the morgue seeing the remaining bodies carla suffered a wave of grief about adas kurt he had lain here with a stickingplaster on his arm and had been thrown on to the conveyor belt and disposed of like a bag of garbage but youre not forgotten kurt she thought they went out into the corridor as they turned towards the back door they heard footsteps and the voice of frau schmidt what is taking those two men so long they hurried along the corridor and through the door the moon was out and the park was brightly lit carla could see the shrubbery where they had hidden the bikes two hundred yards away across the grass frieda came out last and in her rush she let the door bang carla thought fast frau schmidt was likely to investigate the noise the three girls might not reach the shrubbery before she opened the door they had to hide this way carla hissed and she ran around the corner of the building the others followed they flattened themselves against the wall carla heard the door open she held her breath there was a long pause then frau schmidt muttered something unintelligible and the door banged again carla peeped around the corner frau schmidt had gone the three girls ran across the lawn and retrieved their bicycles they pushed the bikes along the forest path and emerged on to the road they switched on their lights mounted up and pedalled away carla felt euphoric they had got away with it as they approached the town triumph gave way to more practical considerations what had they achieved exactly what would they do next they must tell someone what they had seen she was not sure who in any event they had to convince someone would they be believed the more she thought about it the less sure she was when they reached the hostel and dismounted ilse said thank goodness thats over ive never been so scared in all my life its not over said carla what do you mean it wont be over until weve closed that hospital and any others like it how can you do that we need you carla said to her youre the proof i was afraid you were going to say that will you come with us tomorrow when we go back to berlin there was a long pause then ilse said yes i will x volodya peshkov was glad to be home moscow was at its summery best sunny and warm on monday june he returned to red army intelligence headquarters beside the khodynka airfield both werner franck and the tokyo spy had been right germany had invaded the soviet union on june volodya and all the personnel at the soviet embassy in berlin had returned to moscow by ship and train volodya had been prioritized and made it back faster than most some were still travelling volodya now realized how much berlin had been getting him down the nazis were tedious in their selfrighteousness and triumphalism they were like a winning soccer team at the aftermatch party getting drunker and more boring and refusing to go home he was sick of them some people might say that the ussr was similar with its secret police its rigid orthodoxy and its puritan attitudes to such pleasures as abstract painting and fashion they were wrong communism was a work in progress with mistakes being made on the road to a fair society the nkvd with its torture chambers was an aberration a cancer in the body of communism one day it would be surgically removed but probably not in wartime anticipating the outbreak of war volodya had long ago equipped his berlin spies with clandestine radios and code books now it was more vital than ever that the handful of brave antinazis should continue to pass information to the soviets before leaving he had destroyed all records of their names and addresses which now existed only in his head he had found both his parents fit and well although his father looked harassed it was his responsibility to prepare moscow for air raids volodya had gone to see his sister anya her husband ilya dvorkin and the twins now eighteen months old dmitriy called dimka and tatiana called tania unfortunately their father struck volodya as being just as ratlike and contemptible as ever after a pleasant day at home and a good nights sleep in his old room he was ready to start work again he passed through the metal detector at the entrance to the intelligence building the familiar corridors and staircases touched a nostalgic chord even if they were drab and utilitarian walking through the building he half expected people to come up and congratulate him many of them must know he had been the one to confirm barbarossa but no one did perhaps they were being discreet he entered a large open area of typists and file clerks and spoke to the middleaged woman receptionist hello nika are you still here good morning captain peshkov she said not as warmly as he might have hoped colonel lemitov would like to see you right away like volodyas father lemitov had not been important enough to suffer in the great purge of the late thirties and now he had been promoted to fill the place of an unlucky former superior volodya did not know much about the purge but he found it hard to believe that so many senior men had been disloyal enough to merit such punishment not that volodya knew exactly what the punishment was they could be in exile in siberia or in prison somewhere or dead all he knew was that they had vanished nika added he has the big office at the end of the main corridor now volodya walked through the open room nodding and smiling at one or two acquaintances but again he got feeling that he was not the hero he had expected to be he tapped on lemitovs door hoping the boss might shed some light come in volodya entered saluted and closed the door behind him welcome back captain lemitov came around his desk between you and me you did a great job in berlin thank you im honoured sir said volodya but why is this between you and me because you contradicted stalin he held up a hand to forestall protest stalin doesnt know it was you of course but all the same people around here are nervous after the purge of associating with anyone who takes the wrong line what should i have done volodya said incredulously faked wrong intelligence lemitov shook his head emphatically you did exactly the right thing dont get me wrong and ive protected you but just dont expect people around here to treat you like a champion okay said volodya things were worse than he had imagined you have your own office now at least three doors down youll need to spend a day or so catching up volodya took that for dismissal yes sir he said he saluted and left his office was not luxurious a small room with no carpet but he had it to himself he was out of touch with the progress of the german invasion having been busy trying to get home as fast as possible now he put his disappointment aside and began to read the reports of the battlefield commanders for the first week of the war as he did so he became more and more desolate the invasion had taken the red army by surprise it seemed impossible but the evidence covered his desk on june when the germans attacked many forward units of the red army had had no live ammunition that was not all planes had been lined up neatly on airstrips with no camouflage and the luftwaffe had destroyed soviet aircraft in the first few hours of the war army units had been thrown at the advancing germans without adequate weapons with no air cover and lacking intelligence about enemy positions and in consequence had been annihilated worst of all stalins standing order to the red army was that retreat was forbidden every unit had to fight to the last man and officers were expected to shoot themselves to avoid capture troops were never allowed to regroup at a new stronger defensive position this meant that every defeat turned into a massacre consequently the red army was haemorrhaging men and equipment the warning from the tokyo spy and werner francks confirmation had been ignored by stalin even when the attack began stalin had at first insisted it was a limited act of provocation done by german army officers without the knowledge of hitler who would put a stop to it as soon as he found out by the time it became undeniable that it was not a provocation but the largest invasion in the history of warfare the germans had overwhelmed the soviets forward positions after a week they had pushed three hundred miles inside soviet territory it was a catastrophe but what made volodya want to scream out loud was that it could have been avoided there was no doubt whose fault it was the soviet union was an autocracy only one person made the decisions josef stalin he had been stubbornly stupidly disastrously wrong and now his country was in mortal danger until now volodya had believed that soviet communism was the true ideology marred only by the excesses of the secret police the nkvd now he saw that the failure was at the very top beria and the nkvd existed only because stalin permitted them it was stalin who was preventing the march to true communism late that afternoon as volodya was staring out of the window over the sunlit airstrip brooding over what he had learned he was visited by kamen they had been lieutenants together four years ago fresh out of the military intelligence academy and had shared a room with two others in those days kamen had been the clown making fun of everyone daringly mocking pious soviet orthodoxy now he was heavier and seemed more serious he had grown a small black moustache like that of the foreign minister molotov perhaps to make himself look more mature kamen closed the door behind him and sat down he took from his pocket a toy a tin soldier with a key in its back he wound up the key and placed the toy on volodyas desk the soldier swung his arms as if marching and the clockwork mechanism made a loud ratcheting sound as it wound down in a lowered voice kamen said stalin has not been seen for two days volodya realized that the clockwork soldier was there to swamp any listening device that might be hidden in his office he said what do you mean he hasnt been seen he has not come to the kremlin and he is not answering the phone volodya was baffled the leader of a nation could not just disappear whats he doing no one knows the soldier ran down kamen wound it up and set it going again on saturday night when he heard that the soviet western army group had been encircled by the germans he said everythings lost i give up lenin founded our state and weve fucked it up then he went to kuntsevo stalin had a country house near the town of kuntsevo on the outskirts of moscow yesterday he didnt show up at the kremlin at his usual time of midday when they phoned kuntsevo no one answered today the same volodya leaned forward is he suffering his voice fell to a whisper a mental breakdown kamen made a helpless gesture it wouldnt be surprising he insisted against all the evidence that germany would not attack us this year and now look volodya nodded it made sense stalin had allowed himself to be officially called father teacher great leader transformer of nature great helmsman genius of mankind the greatest genius of all times and peoples but now it had been proved even to him that he had been wrong and everyone else right men committed suicide in such circumstances the crisis was even worse than volodya had thought not only was the soviet union under attack and losing it was also leaderless this had to be its most perilous moment since the revolution but was it also an opportunity could it be a chance to get rid of stalin the last time stalin had appeared vulnerable was in when lenins testament had said that stalin was not fit to hold power since stalin had survived that crisis his power had seemed unassailable even volodya could now see clearly when his decisions had verged on madness the purges the blunders in spain the appointment of the sadist beria as head of the secret police the pact with hitler was this emergency the occasion at last to break his hold volodya hid his excitement from kamen and everyone else he hugged his thoughts to himself as he rode the bus home through the soft light of a summer evening his journey was delayed by a slowmoving convoy of lorries towing antiaircraft guns presumably being deployed by his father who was in charge of moscows air raid defences could stalin be deposed he wondered how many kremlin insiders were asking themselves the same question he entered his parents apartment building the tenstorey government house across the moskva river from the kremlin they were out but his sister was there with the twins dimka and tania the boy dimka had dark eyes and hair he held a red pencil and was scribbling messily on an old newspaper the girl had the same intense blueeyed stare that grigori had and so did volodya people said she immediately showed volodya her doll also there was zoya vorotsyntsev the astonishingly beautiful physicist volodya had last seen four years earlier when he was about to leave for spain she and anya had discovered a shared interest in russian folk music they went to recitals together and zoya played the gudok a threestringed fiddle neither could afford a phonograph but grigori had one and they were listening to a record of a balalaika orchestra grigori was not a great music lover but he thought the record sounded jolly zoya was wearing a shortsleeved summer dress the pale colour of her blue eyes when volodya asked her the conventional question about how she was she replied sharply im very angry there were lots of reasons for russians to be angry just now volodya asked whys that my research into nuclear physics has been cancelled all the scientists i work with have been reassigned i myself am working on improvements to the design of bomb sights that seemed very reasonable to volodya we are at war after all you dont understand she said listen when uranium metal undergoes a process called fission enormous quantities of energy are released i mean enormous we know this and western scientists do too we have read their papers in scientific journals still the question of bomb sights seems more immediate zoya said angrily this process fission could be used to create bombs that would be a hundred times more powerful than anything anyone has now one nuclear explosion could flatten moscow what if the germans make such a bomb and we dont have it it will be as if they had rifles and we only had swords volodya said sceptically but is there any reason to believe that scientists in other countries are working on a fission bomb were sure they are the concept of fission leads automatically to the idea of a bomb we thought of it why shouldnt they but theres another reason they published all their early results in the journals and then they stopped suddenly one year ago there have been no new scientific papers on fission since this time last year and you believe the politicians and generals in the west realized the military potential of the research and made it secret i cant think of another reason and yet here in the soviet union we have not even begun to prospect for uranium hmm volodya was pretending to be doubtful but in truth he found it all too credible even stalins greatest admirers a group that included volodyas father grigori did not claim he understood science and it was all too easy for an autocrat to ignore anything that made him uncomfortable ive told your father zoya went on he listens to me but no one listens to him so what are you going to do what can i do im going to make a damn good bomb sight for our airmen and hope for the best volodya nodded he liked that attitude he liked this girl she was smart and feisty and a joy to look at he wondered if she would go to a movie with him talk of physics reminded him of willi frunze who had been his friend at the berlin boys academy according to werner franck willi was a brilliant physicist now studying in england he might know something about the fission bomb zoya was so exercised about and if he was still a communist he might be willing to tell what he knew volodya made a mental note to send a cable to the red army intelligence desk in the london embassy his parents came in father was in full dress uniform mother in a coat and hat they had been to one of the many interminable ceremonies the army loved stalin insisted such rituals continue despite the german invasion because they were so good for morale they cooed over the twins for a few minutes but father looked distracted he muttered something about a phone call and went immediately to his study mother began to make supper volodya talked to the three women in the kitchen but he was desperate to speak to his father he thought he could guess the subject of fathers urgent phone call the overthrow of stalin was being either planned or prevented right now probably here in this building after a few minutes he decided to risk the old mans wrath and interrupt him he excused himself and went to the study but his father was just coming out i have to go to kuntsevo he said volodya longed to know what was going on why he said grigori ignored the question ive called down for my car but my chauffeur has gone home you can drive me volodya was thrilled he had never been to stalins dacha now he was going there at a moment of profound crisis come on his father said impatiently they shouted goodbyes from the hallway and went out grigoris car was a black zisa a soviet copy of an american packard with threespeed automatic transmission its top speed was about eighty miles per hour volodya got behind the wheel and pulled away he drove through the arbat a neighbourhood of craftsmen and intellectuals and out on to the westward mozhaisk highway have you been summoned by comrade stalin he asked his father no stalin has been incommunicado for two days thats what i heard did you its supposed to be secret you cant keep something like that secret whats happening now a group of us are going to kuntsevo to see him volodya asked the key question for what purpose primarily to find out whether hes alive or dead could he really be dead already and no one know about it volodya wondered it seemed unlikely and if hes alive i dont know but whatever happens id rather be there to see it than find out later listening devices did not work in moving cars volodya knew the microphone just picked up engine noise so he was confident he could not be overheard nevertheless he felt fearful as he said the unthinkable could stalin be overthrown his father answered irritably i told you i dont know volodya was electrified such a question demanded a confident negative anything else was a yes his father had admitted the possibility that stalin could be finished volodyas hopes rose volcanically think what that could be like he said joyously no more purges the labour camps will be closed young girls will no longer be pulled off the street to be raped by the secret police he half expected his father to interrupt but grigori just listened with halfclosed eyes volodya went on the stupid phrase trotskyfascist spy will disappear from our language army units who find themselves outnumbered and outgunned could retreat instead of sacrificing themselves uselessly decisions will be made rationally by groups of intelligent men working out whats best for everyone its the communism you dreamed of thirty years ago young fool his father said contemptuously the last thing we want at this point is to lose our leader were at war and retreating our sole aim must be to defend the revolution whatever it takes we need stalin now more than ever volodya felt as if he had been slapped it was many years since his father had called him a fool was the old man right did the soviet union need stalin the leader had made so many disastrous decisions that volodya did not see how the country could possibly be worse off with someone else in charge they reached their destination stalins home was conventionally called a dacha but it was not a country cottage a long low building with five tall windows each side of a grand entrance it stood in a pine forest and was painted dull green as if to hide it hundreds of armed troops guarded the gates and the double barbedwire fence grigori pointed to an antiaircraft battery partly concealed by camouflage netting i put that there he said the guard at the gate recognized grigori but nevertheless asked for their identification documents even though grigori was a general and volodya a captain in intelligence they were both patted down for weapons volodya drove up to the door there were no other cars in front of the house well wait for the others his father said a few moments later three more zis limousines drew up volodya recalled that zis stood for zavod imeni stalina factory called stalin had the executioners arrived in cars named after their victim they all got out eight middleaged men in suits and hats holding in their hands the future of their country among them volodya recognized foreign minister molotov and secretpolice chief beria lets go said grigori volodya was astonished im coming in there with you grigori reached under his seat and handed volodya a tokarev tt pistol put this in your pocket he said if that prick beria tries to arrest me you shoot the fucker volodya took it gingerly the tt had no safety catch he slipped the gun into his jacket pocket it was about seven inches long and got out of the car there were eight rounds he recalled in the magazine of the gun they all went inside volodya feared he would be patted down again and his gun discovered but there was no second check the house was painted dark colours and poorly lit an officer showed the group into what looked like a small dining room stalin sat there in an armchair the most powerful man in the eastern hemisphere appeared haggard and depressed looking up at the group entering the room he said why have you come volodya gasped clearly he thought they were here either to arrest him or to execute him there was a long pause and volodya realized the group had not planned what to do how could they not even knowing whether stalin was alive but what would they do now shoot him there might never be another chance at last molotov stepped forward were asking you to come back to work he said volodya had to suppress the urge to protest but stalin shook his head can i live up to peoples hopes can i lead the country to victory volodya was flabbergasted would he really refuse stalin added there may be better candidates he was giving them a second chance to fire him another member of the group spoke up and volodya recognized marshal voroshilov theres none more worthy he said how did that help this was hardly the time for naked sycophancy then his father joined in saying thats right were they not going to let stalin go how could they be so stupid molotov was the first to say something sensible we propose to form a war cabinet called the state defence committee a kind of ultrapolitburo with a very small membership and sweeping powers stalin quickly interposed who will be its head you comrade stalin volodya wanted to shout no there was another long silence at last stalin spoke very well he said now who else shall we have on the committee beria stepped forward and began to propose the members it was all over volodya realized feeling dizzy with frustration and disappointment they had lost their chance they could have deposed a tyrant but they had lacked the nerve like the children of a violent father they feared they could not manage without him in fact it was worse than that he saw with growing despondency perhaps stalin really had had a breakdown it had certainly seemed real but he had also made a brilliant political move all the men who might replace him were here in this room at the moment when his catastrophically poor judgement had been exposed for all to see he had forced his rivals to come out and beg him to be their leader again he had drawn a line under his appalling mistake and given himself a new start stalin was not just back he was stronger than ever xi who would have the courage to make a public protest about what was going on at akelberg carla and frieda had seen it with their own eyes and they had ilse könig as a witness but now they needed an advocate there were no elected representatives any more all reichstag deputies were nazis there were no real journalists either just scribbling sycophants the judges were all nazi appointees subservient to the government carla had never before realized how much she had been protected by politicians newspapermen and lawyers without them she saw now the government could do anything it liked even kill people who could they turn to friedas admirer heinrich von kessel had a friend who was a catholic priest peter was the cleverest boy in my class he told them but he wasnt the most popular a bit upright and stiffnecked i think hell listen to us though carla thought it was worth a try her protestant pastor had been sympathetic until the gestapo terrified him into silence perhaps the same would happen again but she did not know what else to do heinrich took carla frieda and ilse to peters church in schöneberg early on a sunday morning in july heinrich was handsome in a black suit the girls all wore their nurses uniforms symbols of trustworthiness they entered by a side door and went to a small dusty room with a few old chairs and a large wardrobe they found father peter alone praying he must have heard them come in but he remained on his knees for a minute before getting up and turning to greet them peter was tall and thin with regular features and a neat haircut he was twentyseven carla calculated if he was heinrichs contemporary he frowned at them not troubling to conceal his irritation at being disturbed i am preparing myself for mass he said severely i am pleased to see you in church heinrich but you must leave me now i will see you afterwards this is a spiritual emergency peter said heinrich sit down we have something important to tell you it could hardly be more important than mass yes it could peter believe me in five minutes time you will agree very well this is my girlfriend frieda franck carla was surprised was frieda his girlfriend now frieda said i had a younger brother who was born with spina bifida earlier this year he was transferred to a hospital at akelberg in bavaria for special treatment shortly afterwards we got a letter saying he had died of appendicitis she turned to carla who took up the tale my maid had a son born braindamaged he too was transferred to akelberg the maid got an identical letter on the same day peter spread his hands in a sowhat gesture i have heard this kind of thing before its antigovernment propaganda the church does not interfere in politics what rubbish that was carla thought the church was up to its neck in politics but she let it pass my maids son did not have an appendix she went on he had had it removed two years earlier please said peter what does this prove carla felt discouraged peter was obviously biased against them heinrich said wait peter you havent heard it all ilse here worked at the hospital in akelberg peter looked at her expectantly i was raised catholic father ilse said carla had not known that im not a good catholic ilse went on god is good not us my daughter said peter piously ilse said but i knew that what i was doing was a sin yet i did it because they told me to and i was frightened she began to cry what did you do i killed people oh father will god forgive me the priest stared at the young nurse he could not dismiss this as propaganda he was looking at a soul in torment he went pale the others were silent carla held her breath ilse said the handicapped people are brought to the hospital in grey buses they dont have special treatment we give them an injection and they die then we cremate them she looked up at peter will i ever be forgiven for what i have done he opened his mouth to speak his words caught in his throat and he coughed at last he said quietly how many usually four buses i mean there are about twentyfive patients in a bus a hundred people yes every week peters proud composure had vanished his face was pale grey and his mouth hung open a hundred handicapped people a week yes father what sort of handicap all sorts mental and physical some senile old people some deformed babies men and women paralysed or retarded or just helpless he had to keep repeating it and the staff of the hospital kill them all ilse sobbed im sorry im sorry i knew it was wrong carla watched peter his supercilious air had gone it was a remarkable transformation after years of hearing the prosperous catholics of this sylvan suburb confess their little sins he had suddenly been confronted with raw evil and he was shocked to his core but what would he do peter stood up he took ilse by the hands and raised her from her seat come back to the church he said confess to your priest god will forgive you this much i know thank you she whispered he released her hands and looked at heinrich it may not be so simple for the rest of us he said then he turned his back on them and knelt to pray again carla looked at heinrich who shrugged they got up and left the little room carla with her arm around the weeping ilse carla said well stay for the service perhaps hell speak to us again afterwards the four of them walked into the nave of the church ilse stopped crying and became calmer frieda held heinrichs arm they took seats among the gathering congregation prosperous men and plump women and restless children in their best clothes people such as these would never kill the handicapped carla thought yet their government did on their behalf how had this happened she did not know what to expect of father peter clearly he had believed what they had told him in the end he had wanted to dismiss them as politically motivated but ilses sincerity had convinced him he had been horrified but he had not made any promises except that god would forgive ilse carla looked around the church the decoration was more colourful than what she was used to in protestant churches there were more statues and paintings more marble and gilding and banners and candles protestants and catholics had fought wars about such trivia she recalled how strange it seemed in a world where children could be murdered that anyone should care about candles the service began the priests entered in their robes father peter the tallest among them carla could not read anything in his facial expression except stern piety she sat indifferent through the hymns and prayers she had prayed for her father and two hours later had found him cruelly beaten and dying on the floor of their home she missed him every day sometimes every hour praying had not saved him nor would it protect those deemed useless by the government action was needed not words thinking of her father brought her brother erik to mind he was somewhere in russia he had written a letter home jubilantly celebrating the rapid progress of the invasion and angrily refusing to believe that walter had been murdered by the gestapo their father had obviously been released unharmed by the gestapo and then attacked in the street by criminals or communists or jews he asserted he was living in a fantasy beyond the reach of reason was the same true of father peter peter mounted the pulpit carla had not known he was due to preach a sermon she wondered what he would say would he be inspired by what he had heard this morning would he speak of something irrelevant the virtue of modesty or the sin of envy or would he close his eyes and devoutly thank god for the german armys continuing victories in russia he stood tall in the pulpit and swept the church with a gaze that might have been arrogant or proud or defiant the fifth commandment says thou shalt not kill carla met heinrichs eye what was peter going to say his voice rang out between the echoing stones of the nave there is a place in akelberg bavaria where our government is breaking the commandment a hundred times a week carla gasped he was doing it he was preaching a sermon against the programme this could change everything it makes no difference that the victims are handicapped or mentally ill or incapable of feeding themselves or paralysed peter was letting his anger show helpless babies and senile old people are all gods children and their lives are as sacred as yours and mine his voice rose in volume to kill them is a mortal sin he lifted his right arm and made a fist and his voice shook with emotion i say to you that if we do nothing about it we sin just as much as the doctors and nurses who administer the lethal injections if we remain silent he paused if we remain silent we are murderers too xii inspector thomas macke was furious he had been made to look a fool in the eyes of superintendent kringelein and the rest of his superiors he had assured them he had plugged the leak the secret of akelberg and hospitals of the same kind in other parts of the country was safe he had said he had tracked down the three troublemakers werner franck pastor ochs and walter von ulrich and in different ways he had silenced each of them and yet the secret had come out the man responsible was an arrogant young priest called peter father peter was in front of macke now naked strapped by wrists and ankles to a specially constructed chair he was bleeding from the ears nose and mouth and had vomit all down his chest electrodes were attached to his lips his nipples and his penis a strap around his forehead prevented him from breaking his neck while the convulsions shook him a doctor sitting beside the priest checked his heart with a stethoscope and looked dubious he cant stand much more he said in a matteroffact tone father peters seditious sermon had been taken up elsewhere the bishop of münster a much more important clergyman had preached a similar sermon denouncing the t programme the bishop had called upon hitler to save the people from the gestapo cleverly implying that the führer could not possibly know about the programme thereby offering hitler a readymade alibi his sermon had been typed out and duplicated and passed from hand to hand all over germany the gestapo had arrested every person found in possession of a copy but to no avail it was the only time in the history of the third reich that there had been a public outcry against any government action the clampdown was savage but it did no good the duplicates of the sermon continued to proliferate more clergymen prayed for the handicapped and there was even a protest march in akelberg it was out of control and macke was to blame he bent over peter the priests eyes were closed and his breathing was shallow but he was conscious macke shouted in his ear who told you about akelberg there was no reply peter was mackes only lead investigations in the town of akelberg had turned up nothing of significance reinhold wagner had been told a story about two girl cyclists who had visited the hospital but no one knew who they were and another story about a nurse who had resigned suddenly writing a letter saying she was getting married in haste but not revealing who the husband was neither clue led anywhere in any case macke felt sure this calamity could not be the work of a gaggle of girls macke nodded to the technician operating the machine he turned a knob peter screamed in agony as the electrical current coursed through his body torturing his nerves he shook as if in a fit and the hair on his head stood up the operator turned the current off macke screamed give me his name at last peter opened his mouth macke leaned closer peter whispered no man a woman then give me the name it was an angel damn you to hell macke seized the knob and turned it this goes on until you tell me he yelled as peter shuddered and screamed the door opened a young detective looked in turned pale and beckoned to macke the technician turned the current off and the screaming stopped the doctor leaned forward to check peters heart the detective said excuse me inspector macke but youre wanted by superintendent kringelein now said macke irritably thats what he said sir macke looked at the doctor who shrugged hes young he said hell be alive when you get back macke left the room and went upstairs with the detective kringeleins office was on the first floor macke knocked and went in the damn priest hasnt talked yet he said without preamble i need more time kringelein was a slight man with spectacles clever but weakwilled a late convert to nazism he was not a member of the elite ss he lacked the fervour of enthusiasts such as macke dont bother any further with that priest he said were no longer interested in any of the clergymen throw them in camps and forget them macke could not believe his ears but these people have conspired to undermine the führer and they have succeeded said kringelein whereas you have failed macke suspected that kringelein was privately pleased about this a decision has been made at the top the superintendent went on aktion t has been cancelled macke was flabbergasted the nazis never allowed their decisions to be swayed by the misgivings of the ignorant we didnt get where we are by kowtowing to public opinion he said we have this time why the führer neglected to explain his decision to me personally kringelein said sarcastically but i can guess the programme has attracted remarkably angry protests from a normally passive public if we persist with it we risk an open confrontation with churches of all denominations that would be a bad thing we must not weaken the unity and determination of the german people particularly right now when we are at war with the soviet union our strongest enemy yet so the programme is cancelled very good sir said macke controlling his anger will there be anything else dismissed said kringelein macke went to the door macke he turned yes sir change your shirt my shirt theres blood on it yes sir sorry sir macke stamped down the stairs boiling he returned to the basement chamber father peter was still alive raging he yelled again who told you about akelberg there was no reply he turned the current up to maximum father peter screamed for a long time then at last he fell into a final silence xiii the villa where the franck family lived was set in a small park two hundred yards from the house on a slight rise was a little pagoda open on all sides with seats as children carla and frieda had pretended it was their country house and had played for hours pretending to have grand parties where dozens of servants waited on their glamorous guests later it became their favourite place to sit and talk where no one could hear them the first time i sat on this bench my feet didnt reach the floor carla said frieda said i wish we could go back to those days it was a sultry afternoon overcast and humid and they both wore sleeveless dresses they were in sombre mood father peter was dead he had committed suicide in custody having become depressed about his crimes according to the police carla wondered if he had been beaten as her father had it seemed dreadfully likely there were dozens more in police cells all over germany some had protested publicly about the killing of the handicapped others had done no more than pass round copies of bishop von galens sermon she wondered if all of them would be tortured she wondered how long she would escape such a fate werner came out of the house with a tray he carried it across the lawn to the pagoda cheerily he said how about some lemonade girls carla looked away no thank you she said coldly she did not understand how he could pretend to be her friend after the cowardice he had shown frieda said not for me i hope were not bad friends werner said looking at carla how could he say such a thing of course they were bad friends frieda said father peter is dead werner carla added probably tortured to death by the gestapo because he refused to accept the murder of people such as your brother my father is dead too for the same reason lots of other people are in jail or in camps but you kept your cushy desk job so thats all right werner looked hurt that surprised carla she had expected defiance or at least an effort at insouciance but he seemed genuinely upset he said dont you think we each have our different ways of doing what we can this was feeble you did nothing carla said perhaps he said sadly no lemonade then neither girl answered and he went back to the house carla was indignant and angry but she could not help also feeling regret before she discovered that werner was a coward she had been embarking on a romance with him she had liked him a lot ten times more than any other boy she had kissed she was not quite heartbroken but she was deeply disappointed frieda was luckier this thought was prompted by the sight of heinrich coming out of the house frieda was glamorous and funloving and heinrich was brooding and intense but somehow they made a pair are you in love with him carla said while he was still out of earshot i dont know yet frieda replied hes terribly sweet though i kind of adore him that might not be love carla thought but it was well on the way heinrich was bursting with news i had to come and tell you right away he said my father told me after lunch what said frieda the government has cancelled the project it was called aktion t the killing of the handicapped theyre stopping carla said you mean we won heinrich nodded vigorously my father is amazed he says he has never known the führer give in to public opinion before frieda said and we forced him to thank god no one knows that heinrich said fervently carla said theyre just going to close the hospitals and end the whole programme not exactly what do you mean my father says all those doctors and nurses are being transferred carla frowned where to russia said heinrich ii the phone rang on greg peshkovs desk on a hot morning in july he had finished his penultimate year at harvard and was once again interning at the state department for the summer working in the information office he was good at physics and math and passed exams effortlessly but he had no interest in becoming a scientist politics was what excited him he picked up the phone greg peshkov morning mr peshkov this is tom cranmer gregs heart beat a little faster thank you for returning my call you obviously remember me the ritzcarlton hotel only time i ever got my picture in the paper are you still the hotel detective i moved to retail im a store detective now do you ever do any freelance work sure what did you have in mind im in my office now id like to talk privately you work in the old executive office building across the street from the white house how did you know that im a detective of course im around the corner at aroma coffee on f street and nineteenth i cant come now greg looked at his watch in fact i have to hang up right away ill wait give me an hour greg hurried down the stairs he arrived at the main entrance just as a rollsroyce motor car came silently to a stop outside an overweight chauffeur clambered out and opened the rear door the passenger who emerged was tall lean and handsome with a full head of silver hair he wore a perfectly cut doublebreasted suit of pearlgrey flannel that draped him in a style only london tailors could achieve as he ascended the granite steps to the huge building his fat chauffeur hurried after him carrying his briefcase he was sumner welles undersecretary of state number two at the state department and personal friend of president roosevelt the chauffeur was about to hand the briefcase to a waiting state department usher when greg stepped forward good morning sir he said and he smoothly took the briefcase from the chauffeur and held the door open then he followed welles into the building greg had got into the information office because he was able to show factual wellwritten articles he had produced for the harvard crimson however he did not want to end up a press attaché he had higher ambitions greg admired sumner welles who reminded him of his father the good looks the fine clothes and the charm concealed a ruthless operator welles was determined to take over from his boss secretary of state cordell hull and never hesitated to go behind his back and speak directly to the president which infuriated hull greg found it exciting to be close to someone who had power and was not afraid to use it that was what he wanted for himself welles had taken a shine to him people often did take a shine to greg especially when he wanted them to but in the case of welles there was another factor though welles was married apparently happily to an heiress he had a fondness for attractive young men greg was heterosexual to a fault he had a steady girl at harvard a radcliffe student named emily hardcastle who had promised to acquire a birthcontrol device before september and here in washington he was dating rita the voluptuous daughter of congressman lawrence of texas he walked a tightrope with welles he avoided all physical contact while being amiable enough to remain in favour also he stayed away from welles any time after the cocktail hour when the older mans inhibitions weakened and his hands began to stray now as the senior staff gathered in the office for the ten oclock meeting welles said you can stay for this my boy it will be good for your education greg was thrilled he wondered if the meeting would give him a chance to shine he wanted people to notice him and be impressed a few minutes later senator dewar arrived with his son woody father and son were lanky and largeheaded and wore similar darkblue singlebreasted linen summer suits however woody differed from his father in being artistic his photographs for the harvard crimson had won prizes woody nodded to welless senior assistant bexforth ross they must have met before bexforth was an excessively selfsatisfied guy who called greg russkie because of his russian name welles opened the meeting by saying i now have to tell you all something highly confidential that must not be repeated outside this room the president is going to meet with the british prime minister early next month greg just stopped himself from saying wow good said gus dewar where the plan is to rendezvous by ship somewhere in the atlantic for security and to reduce churchills travel time the president wants me to attend while secretary of state hull stays here in washington to mind the store he also wants you there gus im honoured said gus whats the agenda the british seem to have beaten off the threat of invasion for now but theyre too weak to attack the germans on the european continent unless we help therefore churchill will ask us to declare war on germany we will refuse of course once weve got past that the president wants a joint statement of aims not war aims gus said no because the united states is not at war and has no intention of going to war but we are nonbelligerently allied with the british were supplying them with just about everything they need on unlimited credit and when peace comes at last we expect to have a say in how the postwar world is run will that include a strengthened league of nations gus asked he was keen on this idea greg knew and so was welles thats why i wanted to talk to you gus if we want our plan implemented we need to be prepared we have to get fdr and churchill to commit to it as part of their statement gus said we both know that the president is in favour theoretically but hes nervous about public opinion an aide came in and passed a note to bexforth who read it and said oh my goodness welles said testily what is it the japanese imperial council met last week as you know bexforth said we have some intelligence on their deliberations he was being vague about the source of information but greg knew what he meant the signal intelligence unit of the us army was able to intercept and decode wireless messages from the foreign ministry in tokyo to its embassies abroad the data from these decrypts was codenamed magic greg knew about this even though he was not supposed to in fact there would have been a hell of a stink if the army found out he was in on the secret the japanese discussed extending their empire bexforth went on they had already annexed the vast region of manchuria greg knew and had moved troops into much of the rest of china they do not favour the option of westward expansion into siberia which would mean war with the soviet union thats good said welles it means the russians can concentrate on fighting the germans yes sir but the japs are planning instead to extend southwards by taking full control of indochina then the dutch east indies greg was shocked this was hot news and he was among the first to hear it welles was indignant why thats nothing less than an imperialist war gus interposed technically sumner its not war the japanese already have some troops in indochina with formal permission from the incumbent colonial power france as represented by the vichy government puppets of the nazis i did say technically and the dutch east indies are theoretically ruled by the netherlands which is now occupied by the germans who are perfectly happy for their japanese allies to take over a dutch colony thats a quibble its a quibble that others will raise with us the japanese ambassador for one youre right gus and thanks for forewarning me greg was alert for an opportunity to make a contribution to the discussion he wanted above all else to impress the senior men around him but they all knew so much more than he did welles said what are the japanese after anyway gus said oil rubber and tin theyre securing their access to natural resources its hardly surprising since we keep interfering with their supplies the united states had embargoed exports of materials such as oil and scrap iron to japan in a failed attempt to discourage the japanese from taking over ever larger tracts of asia welles said irritably our embargoes have never been applied very effectively no but the threat is obviously sufficient to panic the japanese who have almost no natural resources of their own clearly we need to take more effective measures welles snapped the japanese have a lot of money in american banks can we freeze their assets the officials around the room looked disapproving this was a radical idea after a moment bexforth said i guess we could that would be more effective than any embargoes they would be unable to buy oil or any other raw materials here in the states because they couldnt pay for them gus dewar said the secretary of state will be concerned as usual to avoid any action that might lead to war he was right cordell hull was cautious to the point of timidity and frequently clashed with his more aggressive deputy welles mr hull has always followed that course and very wisely said welles they all knew he was insincere but etiquette required it however the united states must walk tall on the international stage were prudent not cowardly im going to put this idea of an asset freeze to the president greg was awestruck this was what power meant in a heartbeat welles could propose something that would rock an entire nation gus dewar frowned without imported oil the japanese economy will grind to a halt and their military will be powerless which is good said welles is it what do you imagine japans military government will do faced with such a catastrophe welles did not much like to be challenged he said why dont you tell me senator i dont know but i think we should have an answer before we take the action desperate men are dangerous and i do know that the united states is not ready to go to war against japan our navy isnt ready and our air force isnt ready greg saw his chance to speak and took it mr undersecretary sir it may help you to know that public opinion favours war with japan rather than appeasement by a factor of two to one good point greg thank you americans dont want to let japan get away with murder they dont really want war either said gus no matter what the poll says welles closed the folder on his desk well senator we agree about the league of nations and disagree about japan gus stood up and in both cases the decision will be made by the president good of you to come in to see me the meeting broke up greg left on a high he had been invited into the briefing he had learned startling news and he had made a comment that welles had thanked him for it was a great start to the day he slipped out of the building and headed for aroma coffee he had never hired a private detective before it felt vaguely illegal but cranmer was a respectable citizen and there was nothing criminal about trying to get in contact with an old girlfriend at aroma coffee there were two girls who looked like secretaries taking a break an older couple out shopping and cranmer a broad man in a rumpled seersucker suit dragging on a cigarette greg slid into the booth and asked the waitress for coffee im trying to reconnect with jacky jakes he said to cranmer the black girl she had been a girl back then greg thought nostalgically sweet sixteen though she was pretending to be older its six years ago he said to cranmer shes not a girl any more it was your father who hired her for that little drama not me i dont want to ask him but you can find her right i expect so cranmer took out a little notebook and a pencil i guess jacky jakes was an assumed name mabel jakes is her real name actress right wouldbe i dont know that she made it she had had good looks and charm in abundance but there were not many parts for black actors obviously shes not in the phone book or you wouldnt need me could be unlisted but more likely she cant afford a phone have you seen her since twice first time two years ago not far from here on e street second time two weeks ago two blocks away well she sure as hell doesnt live in this swanky neighbourhood so she must work nearby you have a photo no i remember her vaguely pretty girl dark skin big smile greg nodded remembering that thousandwatt smile i just want her address so i can write her a letter i dont need to know what you want the information for suits me was it really this easy greg thought i charge ten bucks a day with a twoday minimum plus expenses it was less than greg had expected he took out his billfold and gave cranmer a twenty thanks said the detective good luck said greg ii saturday was hot so woody went to the beach with his brother chuck the whole dewar family was in washington they had a nineroom apartment near the ritzcarlton hotel chuck was on leave from the navy papa was working twelve hours a day planning the summit meeting he referred to as the atlantic conference and mama was writing a new book about the wives of presidents woody and chuck put on shorts and polo shirts grabbed towels and sunglasses and newspapers and caught a train to rehoboth beach on the delaware coast the journey took a couple of hours but this was the only place to go on a summer saturday there was a wide stretch of sand and a refreshing breeze off the atlantic ocean and there were a thousand girls in swimsuits the two brothers were different chuck was shorter with a compact athletic figure he had their mothers attractive looks and winning smile he had been a poor student at school but he also displayed mamas quirky intelligence always taking an offcentre view of life he was better than woody at all sports except running where woodys long legs gave him speed and boxing in which woodys long arms made him nearly impossible to hit at home chuck had not said much about the navy no doubt because their parents were still angry with him for not going to harvard but alone with woody he opened up a bit hawaii is great but im really disappointed to have a shore job he said i joined the navy to go to sea what are you doing exactly im part of the signal intelligence unit we listen to radio messages mainly from the imperial japanese navy arent they in code yes but you can learn a lot even without breaking the codes its called traffic analysis a sudden increase in the number of messages indicates that some action is imminent and you learn to recognize patterns in the traffic an amphibious landing has a distinctive configuration of signals for example thats fascinating and i bet youre good at it chuck shrugged im just a clerk annotating and filing the transcripts but you cant help picking up the basics hows the social life in hawaii lots of fun navy bars can get pretty riotous the black cat cafe is the best i have a good pal eddie parry and we go surfboarding on waikiki beach every chance we get ive had some good times but i wish i was on a ship they swam in the cold atlantic ate hot dogs for lunch took photos of each other with woodys camera and studied the swimsuits until the sun began to go down as they were leaving picking their way through the crowd woody saw joanne rouzrokh he did not need to look twice she was like no other girl on the beach nor indeed in delaware there was no mistaking those high cheekbones that scimitar nose the luxuriant dark hair the skin the colour and smoothness of café au lait without hesitation he walked straight towards her she looked absolutely sensational her black onepiece swimsuit had spaghetti straps that revealed the elegant bones of her shoulders it was cut straight across her upper thighs showing almost all of her long brown legs he could hardly believe that he had once taken this fabulous woman in his arms and smooched her like there was no tomorrow she looked up at him shading her eyes from the sun woody dewar i didnt know you were in washington that was all the invitation he needed he knelt on the sand beside her just being this close made him breathe harder hello joanne he glanced briefly at the plump browneyed girl beside her wheres your husband she burst out laughing whatever made you think i was married he was flustered i came to your apartment for a party a couple of summers back you did joannes companion said i remember i asked you your name but you didnt answer woody had no memory of her at all im sorry i was so impolite he said im woody dewar and this is my brother chuck the browneyed girl shook hands with both of them and said im diana taverner chuck sat beside her on the sand which seemed to please her chuck was goodlooking much more handsome than woody woody went on anyway i went into the kitchen looking for you and a man called bexforth ross introduced himself to me as your fiancé i assumed youd be married by now is it an extraordinarily long engagement dont be silly she said with a touch of irritation and he remembered that she did not respond well to teasing bexforth told people we were engaged because he was practically living at our apartment woody was startled did that mean that bexforth had been sleeping there with joanne it was not uncommon of course but few girls admitted it he was the one who talked about marriage she went on i never agreed to it so she was single woody could not have been happier if he had won the lottery there might be a boyfriend he warned himself he would have to find out but anyway a boyfriend was not the same as a husband i was at a meeting with bexforth a few days back woody said hes a great man in the state department hell go far and hell find a woman more suitable than i to be the wife of a great man in the state department it seemed from her tone that she did not have warm feelings towards her former lover woody found that he was pleased about that although he could not have said why he reclined on his elbow the sand was hot if she had a serious boyfriend she would find a reason to mention him before too long he felt sure he said speaking of the state department are you still working there yes im assistant to the undersecretary for europe exciting right now it is woody was looking at the line where her swimsuit crossed her thighs and thinking that no matter how little a girl was wearing a man was always thinking about the parts of her that were hidden he began to get an erection and rolled on to his front to conceal it joanne saw the direction of his gaze and said you like my swimsuit she was always frank it was one of the many things he found attractive about her he decided to be equally candid i like you joanne i always did she laughed dont beat about the bush woody come right out with it all around them people were packing up diane said wed better get going we were just leaving woody said shall we travel together this was the moment for her to give him the polite brushoff she could easily say oh no thanks you guys go on ahead but instead she said sure why not the girls pulled dresses over their swimsuits and threw their stuff into a couple of bags and they all walked up the beach the train was crowded with trippers like them sunburned and hungry and thirsty woody bought four cokes at the station and produced them as the train pulled out joanne said you once bought me a coke on a hot day in buffalo do you remember on that demonstration of course i remember we were just kids buying cokes is a technique i use with beautiful women she laughed is it successful it has never got me a single smooch she raised her bottle in a toast well keep trying he thought that was encouraging so he said when we get back to the city do you want to get a hamburger or something and maybe see a movie this was the moment for her to say no thanks im meeting my boyfriend diana said quickly id like that how about you joanne joanne said sure no boyfriend and a date woody tried to hide his elation we could see the bride came cod he said i hear its pretty funny joanne said whos in it james cagney and bette davis id like to see that diana said me too thats settled then said woody chuck said how about you chuck would you like that oh sure id like it swell but nice of you to ask big brother it was not all that funny but diana giggled appreciatively soon afterwards joanne fell asleep with her head on woodys shoulder her dark hair tickled his neck and he could feel her warm breath on his skin below the cuff of his shortsleeved shirt he felt blissfully contented they parted company at union station went home to change and met up again at a chinese restaurant downtown over chow mein and beer they talked about japan everyone was talking about japan those people have to be stopped said chuck theyre fascists maybe said woody theyre militaristic and aggressive and the way they treat the chinese is racialist what else do they have to do to be fascists i can answer that said joanne the difference is in their vision of the future real fascists want to kill off all their enemies then create a radically new type of society the japanese are doing all the same things in defence of traditional power groups the military caste and the emperor for the same reason spain is not really fascist franco is murdering people for the sake of the catholic church and the old aristocracy not to create a new world either way the japs must be stopped said diana i see it differently said woody joanne said okay woody how do you see it she was seriously political and would appreciate a thoughtful answer he knew japan is a trading nation with no natural resources no oil no iron just some forests the only way they can make a living is by doing business for example they import raw cotton weave it and sell it to india and the philippines but in the depression the two great economic empires britain and the usa put up tariff walls to protect our own industries that was the end of japanese trade with the british empire including india and the american zone including the philippines it hit them pretty hard diana said does that give them the right to conquer the world no but it makes them think that the only way to economic security is to have your own empire as the british do or at least to dominate your hemisphere as the us does then nobody else can close down your business so they want the far east to be their backyard joanne agreed and the weakness of our policy is that every time we impose economic sanctions to punish the japanese for their aggression it only reinforces their feeling that theyve got to be selfsufficient maybe said chuck but they still have to be stopped woody shrugged he did not have an answer to that after dinner they went to the cinema the movie was great then woody and chuck walked the girls back to their apartment on the way woody took joannes hand she smiled at him and squeezed his hand and he took that for encouragement outside the girls building he took her in his arms out of the corner of his eye he saw chuck do the same with diana joanne kissed woodys lips briefly almost chastely then said the traditional goodnight kiss there was nothing traditional about it last time i kissed you he said he bent his head to kiss her again she put a forefinger on his chin and pushed him away surely he thought that little peck was not all he was going to get i was drunk that night she said i know he saw what the problem was she was afraid he was going to think she was easy he said youre even more alluring when youre sober she looked thoughtful for a moment that was the right thing to say she said eventually you win the prize then she kissed him again softly lingering not with the urgency of passion but with a concentration that suggested tenderness all too soon he heard chuck sing out goodnight diana joanne broke the kiss with woody woody said in dismay my brother was a bit quick she laughed softly goodnight woody she said then she turned and walked to the building diana was already at the door looking distinctly disappointed woody blurted out can we have another date he sounded needy even to himself and he cursed his haste but joanne did not seem to mind call me she said and went inside woody watched until the two girls disappeared then he rounded on his brother why didnt you kiss diana longer he said crossly she seems really nice not my type said chuck really woody was more mystified than annoyed nice round tits pretty face whats not to like id have kissed her if i wasnt with joanne we all have different tastes they started to walk back towards their parents apartment well what is your type then woody asked chuck theres something i should probably explain to you before you plan any more double dates okay what chuck stopped forcing woody to do the same you have to swear never to tell papa and mama i swear woody studied his brother in the yellow light of the street lamps whats the big secret i dont like girls a pain in the ass i agree but what are you going to do i mean i dont like to hug and kiss them what dont be stupid were all made differently woody yeah but youd have to be some kind of pansy yes yes what yes im some kind of pansy youre such a kidder im not kidding woody im dead serious youre queer thats exactly what i am i didnt choose to be when we were kids and we started jerking off you used to think about bouncy tits and hairy cunts i never told you that i used to think about big stiff cocks chuck this is disgusting no its not its the way some guys are made more guys than you think especially in the navy there are pansies in the navy chuck nodded vigorously a lot well how do you know we usually recognize one another like jews always know whos jewish for example the waiter in the chinese restaurant he was one didnt you hear him say he liked my jacket yes but i didnt think anything of it there you are he was attracted to you i guess why same reason diana liked me probably hell im betterlooking than you this is weird come on lets go home they continued on their way woody was still reeling you mean there are chinese pansies chuck laughed of course i dont know you never think of chinese guys being that way remember not a word to anyone especially the parents god knows what papa would say after a while woody put his arm around chucks shoulders well what the hell he said at least youre not a republican iii greg peshkov sailed with sumner welles and president roosevelt on a heavy cruiser the augusta to placentia bay off the coast of newfoundland also in the convoy were the battleship arkansas the cruiser tuscaloosa and seventeen destroyers they anchored in two long lines with a broad sea passage down the middle at nine oclock in the morning of saturday august in bright sunshine the crews of all twenty vessels mustered at the rails in their dress whites as the british battleship prince of wales arrived escorted by three destroyers and steamed majestically down the middle bearing prime minister churchill it was the most impressive show of power greg had ever seen and he was delighted to be part of it he was also worried he hoped the germans did not know about this rendezvous if they found out one uboat could kill the two leaders of what remained of western civilization and greg peshkov before leaving washington greg had met with the detective tom cranmer again cranmer had produced an address a house in a lowrent neighbourhood on the far side of union station shes a waitress at the university womens club near the ritzcarlton which is why you saw her in that neighbourhood twice he had said as he pocketed the balance of his fee i guess acting didnt work out for her but she still goes by jacky jakes greg had written her a letter dear jacky i just want to know why you ran out on me six years ago i thought we were so happy but i must have been wrong it bugs me thats all you act scared when you see me but theres nothing to be afraid of im not angry just curious i would never do anything to hurt you you were the first girl i ever loved can we meet just for a cup of coffee or something and talk very sincerely greg peshkov he had added his phone number and mailed the note the day he left for newfoundland the president was keen that the conference should result in a joint statement gregs boss sumner welles wrote a draft but roosevelt refused to use it saying it was better to let churchill produce the first draft greg immediately saw that roosevelt was a smart negotiator whoever produced the first draft would need in all fairness to put in some of what the other side wanted alongside his own demands his statement of the other sides wishes then became an irreducible minimum while all of his own demands were still up for negotiation so the drafter always started at a disadvantage greg vowed to remember never to write the first draft on saturday the president and the prime minister enjoyed a convivial lunch on board the augusta on sunday they attended a church service on the deck of the prince of wales with the stars and stripes and the union jack draping the altar red white and blue on monday morning by which time they were firm friends they got down to brass tacks churchill produced a fivepoint plan that delighted sumner welles and gus dewar by calling for an effective international organization to assure the security of all states in other words a strengthened league of nations but they were disappointed to find that that was too much for roosevelt he was in favour but he feared the isolationists people who still believed america did not need to get involved with the troubles of the rest of the world he was extraordinarily sensitive to public opinion and made ceaseless efforts not to provoke opposition welles and dewar did not give up nor did the british they got together to seek a compromise acceptable to both leaders greg took notes for welles the group came up with a clause that called for disarmament pending the establishment of a wider and more permanent system of general security they put it to the two great men who accepted it welles and dewar were jubilant greg could not see why it seems so little he said all that effort the leaders of two great countries brought together across thousands of miles dozens of staffers twentyfour ships three days of talks and all for a few words that dont quite say what we want we move by inches not miles said gus dewar with a smile thats politics iv woody and joanne had been dating for five weeks woody wanted to go out with her every night but he held back nevertheless he had seen her on four of the last seven days sunday they had gone to the beach wednesday they had dinner friday they saw a movie and today saturday they were spending the whole day together he never tired of talking to her she was funny and intelligent and sharptongued he loved the way she was so definite about everything they jawed for hours about the things they liked and hated the news from europe was bad the germans were still thrashing the red army east of smolensk they had wiped out the russian th and th armies taking prisoners leaving few soviet forces between the germans and moscow but bad news from afar could not dampen woodys elation joanne probably was not as crazy about him as he was about her but she was fond of him he could tell they always kissed goodnight and she seemed to enjoy it though she did not show the kind of passion he knew she was capable of perhaps it was because they always had to kiss in public places such as the cinema or a doorway on the street near her building when they were in her apartment there was always at least one of her two flatmates in the living room and she had not yet invited him to her bedroom chucks leave had ended weeks ago and he was back in hawaii woody still did not know what to think about chucks confession sometimes he felt as shocked as if the world had turned upsidedown other times he asked himself what difference it made to anything but he kept his promise not to tell anyone not even joanne then woodys father went off with the president and his mother went to buffalo to spend a few days with her parents so woody had the washington apartment all nine rooms to himself for a few days he decided he would look out for an opportunity to invite joanne rouzrokh there in the hope of getting a real kiss they had lunch together and went to an exhibition called negro art which had been attacked by conservative writers who said there was no such thing as negro art despite the unmistakable genius of such people as the painter jacob lawrence and the sculptor elizabeth catlett as they left the exhibition woody said would you like to have cocktails while we decide where to go for dinner no thanks she said in her usual decisive manner id really like a cup of tea tea he was not sure where you could get good tea in washington then he had a brainwave my mother has english tea he said we could go to the apartment okay the building was a few blocks away on nd street nw near l street they breathed easier as they stepped out of the summer heat into the airconditioned lobby a porter took them up in the elevator as they entered the apartment joanne said i see your papa around washington all the time but i havent talked to your mama for years i must congratulate her on her bestseller shes not here right now woody said come into the kitchen he filled the kettle from the tap and put it on the heat then he put his arms around joanne and said alone at last where are your parents out of town both of them and chuck is in hawaii yes she moved away from him woody how could you do this to me do what im making you tea youve got me up here on false pretences i thought your parents were at home i never said that why didnt you tell me they were away you didnt ask he said indignantly though there was a grain of truth in her complaint he would not have lied to her but he had been hoping he would not have to tell her in advance that the apartment was empty you got me up here to make a pass you think im a cheap broad i do not its just that were never really private i was hoping for a kiss thats all dont try to kid me now she really was being unjust yes he hoped to go to bed with her one day but no he had not expected to do so today well go he said well get tea somewhere else the ritzcarlton is right down the street all the british stay there they must have tea oh dont be stupid we dont need to leave im not afraid of you i can fight you off im just mad at you i dont want a man who goes out with me because he thinks im easy easy he said his voice rising hell ive waited six years for you to condescend to go out with me even now all im asking for is a kiss if youre easy id hate to be in love with a girl whos difficult to his astonishment she started to laugh now what he said irritably im sorry youre right she said if you wanted a girl who was easy you would have given up on me long ago exactly after i kissed you like that when i was drunk i thought you must have a low opinion of me i assumed you were chasing me for a cheap thrill ive even been worrying about that in the last few weeks i misjudged you im sorry he was bewildered by her rapid changes of mood but he figured this latest phase was an improvement i was crazy about you even before that kiss he said i guess you didnt notice i hardly noticed you im pretty tall its your only attractive feature physically he smiled i wont get swollenheaded talking to you will i not if i can help it the kettle boiled he put tea in a china pot and poured water on top joanne looked thoughtful you said something else a minute ago what you said id hate to be in love with a girl whos difficult did you mean it did i mean what the part about being in love oh i didnt intend to say that he threw caution to the wind but hell yes if you want to know the truth im in love with you i think ive loved you for years i adore you i want she put her arms around his neck and kissed him this time it was the real thing her mouth moving urgently against his the tip of her tongue touching his lips her body pressing against his it was like except that she did not taste of whisky this was the girl he loved the real joanne he thought ecstatically a woman of strong passions and she was in his arms and kissing him for all she was worth she pushed her hands up inside his summer sports shirt and rubbed his chest pressing her fingers into his ribs grazing his nipples with her palms grasping his shoulders as if she wanted to sink her hands deep into his flesh he realized that she too had a store of frustrated desire that was now overflowing like a busted dam out of control he did the same to her stroking her sides and grasping her breasts with a feeling of happy liberation like a child let out of school for an unexpected holiday when he pressed his eager hand between her thighs she pulled away but what she said surprised him have you got any birth control no im sorry its okay in fact its good it proves you really didnt plan to seduce me i wish i had never mind i know a woman doctor wholl fix me up on monday meanwhile well improvise kiss me again as he did so he felt her unbuttoning his pants oh she said a moment later how nice thats just what i was thinking he whispered i may need two hands though what i guess it goes with being so tall i dont know what youre talking about then ill shut up and kiss you a few minutes later she said handkerchief fortunately he had one he opened his eyes a few moments before the end and saw her looking at him in her expression he read desire and excitement and something else that he thought might even be love when it was over he felt blissfully calm i love her he thought and im happy how good life is that was wonderful he said id like to do the same for you would you she said really you bet they were still standing there in the kitchen leaning against the door of the refrigerator but neither of them wanted to move she took his hand and guided it under her summer dress and inside her cotton underwear he felt hot skin crisp hair and a wet cleft he tried to push his finger inside but she said no grasping his fingertip she guided it between the soft folds he felt something small and hard the size of a pea just under the skin she moved his finger in a little circle yes she said closing her eyes just like that he watched her face adoringly as she abandoned herself to the sensation in a minute or two she gave a little cry and repeated it two or three times then she withdrew his hand and slumped against him after a while he said your tea will be cold she laughed i love you woody do you really i hope youre not spooked by me saying that no he smiled it makes me very happy i know girls arent supposed to come right out with it just like that but i cant pretend to dither once i make up my mind thats it yes said woody id noticed that v greg peshkov was living in his fathers permanent apartment at the ritzcarlton lev came and went stopping off for a few days between buffalo and los angeles at present greg had the place to himself except that the congressmans curvy daughter rita lawrence had stayed overnight and now looked adorably tousled in a mans red silk dressing gown a waiter brought them breakfast the newspapers and a message envelope the joint statement by roosevelt and churchill had caused more of a stir than greg had expected it was still the main news more than a week later the press called it the atlantic charter it had seemed to greg to be all cautious phrases and vague commitments but the world saw it otherwise it was hailed as a trumpet blast for freedom democracy and world trade hitler was reported to be furious saying it amounted to a declaration of war by the united states against germany countries that had not been at the conference nevertheless wanted to sign the charter and bexforth ross had suggested the signatories should be called the united nations meanwhile the germans were overrunning the soviet union in the north they were closing in on leningrad in the south the retreating russians had blown up the dnieper dam the biggest hydroelectric power complex in the world and their pride and joy in order to deny its power to the conquering germans a heartbreaking sacrifice the red army has slowed the invasion a bit greg said to rita reading from the washington post but the germans are still advancing five miles a day and they claim to have killed three and a half million soviet soldiers is it possible do you have any relatives in russia as a matter of fact i do my father told me one time when he was a little drunk that he left a pregnant girl behind rita made a disapproving face thats him im afraid greg said hes a great man and great men dont obey the rules she said nothing but he could read her expression she disagreed with his view but was not willing to quarrel with him about it anyway i have a russian halfbrother illegitimate like me greg went on his name is vladimir but i dont know anything else about him he may be dead by now hes the right age to fight hes probably one of those three and a half million he turned the page when he had finished the paper he read the message the waiter had brought it was from jacky jakes it gave a phone number and just said not between and suddenly greg could not wait to get rid of rita what time are you expected home he asked unsubtly she looked at her watch oh my gosh i should be there before my mother starts looking for me she had told her parents she was staying over with a girlfriend they got dressed together and left in two cabs greg figured the phone number must be jackys place of work and that she would be busy between one oclock and three he would phone her around midmorning he wondered why he was so excited after all he was only curious rita lawrence was greatlooking and very sexy but with her and several others he had never recaptured the excitement of that first affair with jacky no doubt that was because he could never again be fifteen years old he got to the old executive office building and began his main task for the day which was drafting a press release on advice to americans living in north africa where british italians and germans fought backwards and forwards mostly on a coastal strip two thousand miles long and forty miles wide at tenthirty he phoned the number on the message a womans voice answered university womens club greg had never been there men went only as guests of female members he said is jacky jakes there yes shes expecting a call please hold on she probably had to get special permission to receive a phone call at work he reflected a few moments later he heard this is jacky whos that greg peshkov i thought so how did you get my address i hired a private detective can we meet i guess we have to but theres one condition what you have to swear by all thats holy not to tell your father never ever why ill explain later he shrugged okay do you swear sure she persisted say it i swear it okay all right you can buy me lunch greg frowned are there any restaurants in this neighbourhood that will serve a white man and a black woman together only one that i know of the electric diner ive seen it he had noticed the name but he had never been inside it was a cheap lunch counter used by janitors and messengers what time half past eleven so early what time do you think waitresses have lunch one oclock he grinned youre as sassy as ever she hung up greg finished his press release and took the typed sheets into his bosss office dropping the draft into the intray he said would it be convenient for me to take an early lunch mike around eleventhirty mike was reading the oped page of the new york times yeah no problem he said without looking up greg walked past the white house in the sunshine and reached the diner at eleventwenty it was empty but for a handful of people taking a midmorning break he sat in a booth and ordered coffee he wondered what jacky would have to say he looked forward to the solution of a puzzle that had mystified him for six years she arrived at eleven thirtyfive wearing a black dress and flat shoes her waitress uniform without the apron he presumed black suited her and he remembered vividly the sheer pleasure of looking at her with her bowshaped mouth and her big brown eyes she sat opposite him and ordered a salad and a coke greg had more coffee he was too tense to eat her face had lost the childish plumpness he remembered she had been sixteen when they met so she was twentytwo now they had been kids playing at being grown up now they really were adults in her face he read a story that had not been there six years ago disappointment and suffering and hardship i work the day shift she told him come in at nine set the tables dress the room wait at lunch clear away leave at five most waitresses work in the evening i like to have evenings and weekends free still a party girl no mostly i stay home and listen to the radio i guess you have lots of boyfriends all i want it took him a moment to realize that could mean anything her lunch came she drank her coke and picked at the salad greg said so why did you run out back in she sighed i dont want to tell you this because youre not going to like it i have to know i got a visit from your father greg nodded i figured he must have had something to do with it he had a goon with him joe something joe brekhunov hes a thug greg began to feel angry did he hurt you he didnt need to greg i was scared to death just looking at him i was ready to do anything your father wanted greg suppressed his fury what did he want he said i had to leave right then i could write you a note but he would read it i had to come back here to washington i was so sad to leave you greg remembered his own anguish me too he said he was tempted to reach across the table and take her hand but he was not sure she would want that she went on he said he would give me a weekly allowance just to keep away from you hes still paying me its only a few bucks but it takes care of the rent i promised but somehow i managed to summon up the nerve to make one condition what that he would never make a pass at me if he did i would tell you everything and he agreed yes not many people get away with threatening him she pushed her plate away then he said if i broke my word joe would cut my face joe showed me his straight razor it all fell into place thats why youre still scared her dark skin was bloodless with fear you bet your goddamn life gregs voice fell to a whisper jacky im sorry she forced a smile are you sure he was so wrong you were fifteen its not a good age to get married if he had said that to me it might be different but he decides whats going to happen and just does it as if no one else is entitled to an opinion still we had good times you bet i was your gift he laughed best present i ever got so what are you doing these days working in the press office at the state department for the summer she made a face sounds boring its the opposite its so exciting to watch powerful men make earthshaking decisions just sitting there at their desks they run the world she looked sceptical but said well it probably beats waitressing he began to see how far apart they had moved in september im going back to harvard for my last year i bet youre a gift to the coeds there are lots of men and not many girls you do all right though dont you i cant lie to you he wondered whether emily hardcastle had kept her promise and got herself fitted with a contraceptive device youll marry one of them and have beautiful children and live in a house on the edge of a lake id like to be something in politics maybe secretary of state or a senator like woody dewars father she looked away greg thought about that house on the edge of a lake it must be her dream he felt sad for her youll make it she said i know you have that air about you even when you were fifteen you had it youre like your father what come on she shrugged think about it greg you knew i didnt want to see you but you set a private dick on me he decides whats going to happen and just does it as if no one else is entitled to an opinion thats what you said about him a minute ago greg was dismayed i hope im not completely like him she gave him an appraising look the jurys still out the waitress took her plate some dessert she said peach pies good neither of them wanted dessert so the waitress gave greg the bill jacky said i hope ive satisfied your curiosity thank you i appreciate it next time you see me on the street just walk on by if thats what you want she stood up lets leave separately id feel more comfortable whatever you say good luck greg good luck to you tip the waitress she said and she walked away iii in october the snow fell and melted and the streets of moscow were cold and wet volodya was searching in the store cupboard for his valenki the traditional felt boots that warmed the feet of muscovites in winter when he was astonished to see six cases of vodka his parents were not great drinkers they rarely took more than one small glass now and again his father went to one of stalins long boozy dinners with old comrades and staggered in through the door in the early hours of the morning as drunk as a skunk but in this house a bottle of vodka lasted a month or more volodya went into the kitchen his parents were having breakfast canned sardines with black bread and tea father he said why do we have six years supply of vodka in the store cupboard his father looked surprised both men looked at katerina who blushed then she switched on the radio and turned the volume down to a low mutter did she suspect their apartment had concealed listening devices volodya wondered she spoke quietly but angrily what are you going to use for money when the germans get here she said we wont belong to the privileged elite any longer well starve unless we can buy food on the black market im too damn old to sell my body vodka will be better than gold volodya was shocked to hear his mother talking this way the germans arent going to get here his father said volodya was not so sure they were advancing again closing the jaws of a pincer around moscow they had reached kalinin in the north and kaluga to the south both cities only about a hundred miles away soviet casualties were unimaginably high a month ago red army troops had held the line but only were left according to the estimates reaching volodyas desk he said to his father who the hell is going to stop them their supply lines are stretched theyre unprepared for our winter weather we will counterattack when theyre weakened so why are you moving the government out of moscow the bureaucracy was in the process of being transported two thousand miles east to the city of kuibyshev the citizens of the capital had been unnerved by the sight of government clerks carrying boxes of files out of their office buildings and packing them into trucks thats just a precaution grigori said stalin is still here there is a solution volodya argued we have hundreds of thousands of men in siberia we need them here as reinforcements grigori shook his head we cant leave the east undefended japan is still a threat japan is not going to attack us we know that volodya glanced at his mother he knew he should not talk about secret intelligence in front of her but he did anyway the tokyo source that warned us correctly that the germans were about to invade has now told us that the japanese will not surely were not going to disbelieve him again evaluating intelligence is never easy we dont have a choice volodya said angrily we have twelve armies in reserve a million men if we deploy them moscow might survive if we dont were finished grigori looked troubled dont speak like that even in private why not ill probably be dead soon anyway his mother started to cry his father said now look what youve done volodya left the room putting on his boots he asked himself why he had shouted at his father and made his mother cry he saw that it was because he now believed that germany would defeat the soviet union his mothers stash of vodka to be used as currency during a nazi occupation had forced him to confront the reality were going to lose he said to himself the end of the russian revolution is in sight he put on his coat and hat then he returned to the kitchen he kissed his mother and embraced his father whats this for said his father youre only going to work its just in case we never meet again volodya said then he went out when he crossed the bridge into the city centre he found that all public transport had stopped the metro was closed and there were no buses or trams it seemed there was nothing but bad news this mornings bulletin from sovinformburo broadcast on the radio and from blackpainted loudspeaker posts on street corners had been uncharacteristically honest during the night of to october the position on the western front became worse it had said large numbers of german tanks broke through our defences everyone knew that sovinformburo always lied so they assumed the real situation was even worse the city centre was clogged with refugees they were pouring in from the west with their possessions in handcarts driving herds of skinny cows and filthy pigs and wet sheep through the streets heading for the countryside east of moscow desperate to get as far away as possible from the advancing germans volodya tried to hitch a lift there was not much civilian traffic in moscow these days fuel was being saved for the endless military convoys driving around the garden ring orbital road he was picked up by a new gaz jeep looking from the open vehicle he saw a good deal of bomb damage diplomats returning from england said this was nothing by comparison with the london blitz but muscovites thought it was bad enough volodya passed several wrecked buildings and dozens of burnedout wooden houses grigori in charge of air raid defence had mounted antiaircraft guns on the tops of the tallest buildings and launched barrage balloons to float below the snow clouds his most bizarre decision had been to order the golden onion domes of the churches to be painted in camouflage green and brown he had admitted to volodya that this would make no difference to the accuracy or otherwise of the bombing but he said it gave citizens the feeling that they were being protected if the germans won and the nazis ruled moscow then volodyas nephew and niece the twin children of his sister anya would be brought up not as patriotic communists but as slavish nazis saluting hitler russia would be like france a country in servitude perhaps partly ruled by an obedient profascist government that would round up jews to be sent to concentration camps it hardly bore thinking about volodya wanted a future in which the soviet union could free itself from the malign rule of stalin and the brutality of the secret police and begin to build true communism when volodya reached the headquarters building at the khodynka airfield he found the air full of greyish flakes that were not snow but ash red army intelligence was burning its records to prevent them falling into enemy hands shortly after he arrived colonel lemitov came into his office you sent a memo to london about a german physicist called wilhelm frunze that was a very smart move it turned out to be a great lead well done what does it matter volodya thought the panzers were only a hundred miles away it was too late for spies to help but he forced himself to concentrate frunze yes i was at school with him in berlin london contacted him and he is willing to talk they met at a safe house as lemitov talked he fiddled with his wristwatch it was unusual for him to fidget he was clearly tense everyone was tense volodya said nothing obviously some information had come out of the meeting otherwise lemitov would not be talking about it london say that frunze was wary at first and suspected our man of belonging to the british secret police lemitov said with a smile in fact after the initial meeting he went to kensington palace gardens and knocked on the door of our embassy and demanded confirmation that our man was genuine volodya smiled a real amateur exactly said lemitov a disinformation decoy wouldnt do anything so stupid the soviet union was not finished yet not quite so volodya had to carry on as if willi frunze mattered what did he give us sir he says he and his fellow scientists are collaborating with the americans to make a superbomb volodya startled recalled what zoya vorotsyntsev had told him this confirmed her worst fears lemitov went on theres a problem with the information what weve translated it but we still cant understand a word lemitov handed volodya a sheaf of typewritten sheets volodya read a heading aloud isotope separation by gaseous diffusion you see what i mean i did languages at university not physics but you once mentioned a physicist you know lemitov smiled a gorgeous blonde who declined to go to a movie with you if i remember volodya blushed he had told kamen about zoya and kamen must have repeated the gossip the trouble with having a spy for a boss was that he knew everything shes a family friend she told me about an explosive process called fission do you want me to question her unofficially and informally i dont want to make a big thing of this until i understand it frunze may be a crackpot and he could make us look foolish find out what the reports are about and whether frunze is making scientific sense if hes genuine can the british and americans really make a superbomb and the germans too i havent seen zoya for two or three months lemitov shrugged it did not really matter how well volodya knew zoya in the soviet union answering questions put by the authorities was never optional ill track her down lemitov nodded do it today he went out volodya frowned thoughtfully zoya was sure the americans were making a superbomb and she had been convincing enough to persuade grigori to mention it to stalin but stalin had scorned the idea now a spy in england was saying what zoya had said it looked as if she had been right and stalin had been wrong again the leaders of the soviet union had a dangerous tendency to deny the truth of bad news only last week an air reconnaissance mission had spotted german armoured vehicles just eighty miles from moscow the general staff had refused to believe it until the sighting had been confirmed twice then they had ordered the reporting air officer to be arrested and tortured by the nkvd for provocation it was difficult to think long term when the germans were so close but the possibility of a bomb that could flatten moscow could not be disregarded even at this moment of extreme peril if the soviets beat the germans they might afterwards be attacked by britain and america something similar had happened after the war would the ussr find itself helpless against a capitalistimperialist superbomb volodya detailed his assistant lieutenant belov to find out where zoya was while waiting for the address volodya studied frunzes reports in the original english and in translation memorizing what seemed to be key phrases as he could not take the papers out of the building at the end of an hour he understood enough to ask further questions belov discovered that zoya was not at the university nor at the nearby apartment building for scientists however the building administrator told him that all the younger residents had been requested to help with the construction of new inner defences for the city and gave him the location where zoya was working volodya put on his coat and went out he felt excited but he was not sure whether that was on account of zoya or the superbomb maybe both he was able to get an army zis and driver passing the kazan station for trains to the east he saw what looked like a fullblown riot it seemed that people could not get into the station let alone board the trains affluent men and women were struggling to reach the entrance doors with their children and pets and suitcases and trunks volodya was shocked to see some of them punching and kicking one another shamelessly a few policemen looked on helpless it would have taken an army to impose order military drivers were normally taciturn but this one was moved to comment fucking cowards he said running away leaving us to fight the nazis look at them in their fur fucking coats volodya was surprised criticism of the ruling elite was dangerous such remarks could cause a man to be denounced then he would spend a week or two in the basement of the nkvds headquarters in lubyanka square he might come out crippled for life volodya had an unnerving sense that the rigid system of hierarchy and deference that sustained soviet communism was beginning to weaken and disintegrate they found the barricade party just where the building administrator had predicted volodya got out of the car told the driver to wait and studied the work a main road was strewn with antitank hedgehogs a hedgehog consisted of three pieces of steel railway track each a yard long welded together at their centres forming an asterisk that stood on three feet and stuck three arms up apparently they wreaked havoc with caterpillar tracks behind the hedgehog field an antitank ditch was being dug with pickaxes and shovels and beyond that a sandbag wall was going up with gaps for defenders to shoot through a narrow zigzag path had been left between the obstacles so that the road could continue to be used by muscovites until the germans arrived almost all the workers digging and building were women volodya found zoya beside a sand mountain filling sacks with a shovel for a minute he watched her from a distance she wore a dirty coat woollen mittens and felt boots her blonde hair was pulled back and covered with a colourless rag tied under her chin her face was smeared with mud but she still looked sexy she wielded the shovel in a steady rhythm working efficiently then the supervisor blew a whistle and work stopped zoya sat on a stack of sandbags and took from her coat pocket a small packet wrapped in newspaper volodya sat beside her and said you could have got exemption from this work its my city she said why wouldnt i help to defend it so youre not fleeing to the east im not running away from the motherfucking nazis her vehemence surprised him plenty of people are i know i thought youd be long gone you have a low opinion of me you think i belong to a selfish elite she shrugged those who are able to save themselves generally do well youre wrong all my family are still here in moscow perhaps i misjudged you would you like a pancake she opened her packet to reveal four palecoloured patties wrapped in cabbage leaves try one he accepted and took a bite it was not very tasty what is it potato peelings you can get a bucketful free at the back door of any party canteen or officers mess you mince them small in the kitchen grinder boil them until theyre soft mix them with a little flour and milk add salt if youve got any and fry them in lard i didnt know you were so badly off he said feeling embarrassed you can always get a meal at our place you know thank you what brings you here a question what is isotope separation by gaseous diffusion she stared at him oh my god whats happened nothing has happened im simply trying to evaluate some dubious information are we building a fission bomb at last her reaction told him that the information from frunze was probably sound she had immediately understood the significance of what hed said please answer the question volodya said sternly even though were friends this is official business okay do you know what an isotope is no some elements exist in slightly different forms carbon atoms for example always have six protons but some have six neutrons and others have seven or eight the different types are isotopes called carbon carbon and carbon simple enough even for a student of languages volodya said why is it important uranium has two isotopes u and u in natural uranium the two are mixed up but only u is explosive so we need to separate them gaseous diffusion would be one way theoretically when a gas is diffused through a membrane the lighter molecules pass through faster so the emerging gas is richer in the lower isotope of course ive never seen it done frunzes report said that the british were building a gaseous diffusion plant in wales in the west of the united kingdom the americans were also building one would there be any other purpose for such a plant she shook her head figure the odds she said anyone who prioritizes this kind of process in wartime is either going crazy or building a weapon volodya saw a car approach the barricade and begin to negotiate the zigzag passage it was a kim a small twodoor car designed for affluent families it had a top speed of sixty miles per hour but this one was so overloaded it probably would not do forty a man in his sixties was at the wheel wearing a hat and a westernstyle cloth coat beside him was a young woman in a fur hat the back seat of the car was piled with cardboard boxes there was a piano strapped precariously to the roof this was clearly a senior member of the ruling elite trying to get out of town with his wife or mistress and as many of his valuables as he could take the kind of person zoya assumed volodya to be which was perhaps why she had declined to go out with him he wondered if she might be revising her opinion of him one of the barricade volunteers moved a hedgehog in front of the kim and volodya saw that there was going to be trouble the car inched forward until its bumper touched the hedgehog perhaps the driver thought he could nudge it out of the way several more women came closer to watch the device was designed to resist being pushed out of the way its legs dug into the ground jamming and it stuck fast there was a sound of bending metal as the cars front bumper deformed the driver put it in reverse and backed off he stuck his head out of the window and yelled move that thing right now he sounded as if he was used to being obeyed the volunteer a chunky middleaged woman wearing a mans checked cap folded her arms she shouted move it yourself deserter the driver got out redfaced with anger and volodya was surprised to recognize colonel bobrov whom he had known in spain bobrov had been famous for shooting his own men in the back of the head if they retreated no mercy for cowards had been his slogan at belchite volodya had personally seen him kill three international brigade troops for retreating when they ran out of ammunition now bobrov was in civilian clothes volodya wondered if he would shoot the woman who had blocked his way bobrov walked to the front of the car and took hold of the hedgehog it was heavier than he had expected but with an effort he was able to drag it out of the way as he was walking back to his car the woman in the cap replaced the hedgehog in front of the car the other volunteers were now crowding around watching the confrontation grinning and making jokes bobrov walked up to the woman taking from his coat pocket an identification card i am general bobrov he said he must have been promoted since returning from spain let me pass you call yourself a soldier the woman sneered why arent you fighting bobrov flushed he knew her contempt was justified volodya wondered if the brutal old soldier had been talked into fleeing by his younger wife i call you a traitor said the volunteer in the cap trying to run away with your piano and your young tart then she knocked his hat off volodya was flabbergasted he had never seen such defiance of authority in the soviet union back in berlin before the nazis came to power he had been surprised by the sight of ordinary germans fearlessly arguing with police officers but it did not happen here the crowd of women cheered bobrov still had shortcropped white hair all over his head he looked at his hat as it rolled across the wet road he took one step in pursuit then thought better of it volodya was not tempted to intervene there was nothing he could do against the mob and anyway he had no sympathy for bobrov it seemed just that bobrov should be treated with the brutality he had always shown to others another volunteer an older woman wrapped in a filthy blanket opened the cars trunk look at all this she said the trunk was full of leather luggage she pulled out a suitcase and thumbed its catches the lid came open and the contents fell out lacy underwear linen petticoats and nightdresses silk stockings and camisoles all obviously made in the west finer than anything ordinary russian women ever saw let alone bought the filmy garments dropped into the filthy slush of the street and stuck there like petals on a dunghill some of the women started to pick them up others seized more suitcases bobrov ran to the back of his car and started to shove the women away this was turning very nasty volodya thought bobrov probably carried a gun and he would draw it any second now but then the woman in the blanket lifted a spade and hit bobrov hard over the head a woman who could dig a trench with a spade was no weakling and the blow made a sickeningly loud thud as it connected the general fell to the ground and the woman kicked him the young mistress got out of the car the woman in the cap shouted coming to help us dig and the others laughed the generals girlfriend who looked about thirty put her head down and walked back along the road the way the car had come the volunteer in the checked cap shoved her but she dodged between the hedgehogs and started to run the volunteer ran after her the mistress was wearing tan suede shoes with a high heel and she slipped in the wet and fell down her fur hat came off she struggled to her feet and started to run again the volunteer went after the hat letting the mistress go all the suitcases now lay open around the abandoned car the workers pulled the boxes from the back seat and turned them upside down emptying the contents on to the road cutlery spilled out china broke and glassware smashed embroidered bedsheets and white towels were dragged through the slush a dozen pretty pairs of shoes were scattered across the tarmac bobrov got to his knees and tried to stand the woman in the blanket hit him with the spade again bobrov collapsed on the ground she unbuttoned bobrovs fine wool coat and tried to pull it off him bobrov struggled resisting the woman became furious and hit bobrov again and again until he lay still his cropped white head covered with blood then she discarded her old blanket and put bobrovs coat on volodya walked across to bobrovs unmoving body the eyes stared lifelessly volodya knelt down and checked for breathing a heartbeat or a pulse there was none the man was dead no mercy for cowards volodya said but he closed bobrovs eyes some of the women unstrapped the piano the instrument slid off the car roof and hit the ground with a discordant clang they began gleefully to smash it up with picks and shovels others were quarrelling over the scattered valuables snatching up the cutlery bundling the bedsheets tearing the fine underwear as they struggled for possession fights broke out a china teapot came flying through the air and just missed zoyas head volodya hurried back to her this is developing into a fullscale riot he said ive got an army car and a driver ill get you out of here she hesitated only for a second thanks she said and they ran to the car jumped in and drove away ii erik von ulrichs faith in the führer was vindicated by the invasion of the soviet union as the german armies raced across the vastness of russia sweeping the red army aside like chaff erik rejoiced in the strategic brilliance of the leader to whom he had given his allegiance not that it was easy during rainy october the countryside had been a mud bath they called it the rasputitsa the time of no roads eriks ambulance had ploughed through a quagmire a wave of mud built up in front of the vehicle gradually slowing it until he and hermann had to get out and clear it away with shovels before they could drive any farther it was the same for the entire german army and the dash for moscow had slowed to a crawl furthermore the swamped roads meant that supply trucks never caught up the army was low on ammunition fuel and food and eriks unit was dangerously short of drugs and other medical necessities so erik had at first rejoiced when the frost had set in at the beginning of november the freeze seemed a blessing making the roads hard again and allowing the ambulance to move at normal speed but erik shivered in his summer coat and cotton underwear winter uniforms had not yet arrived from germany nor had the lowtemperature lubricants needed to keep the engine of his ambulance operating and the engines of all the armys trucks tanks and artillery while on the road erik got up every two hours in the night to start his engine and run it for five minutes the only way to keep the oil from congealing and the coolant from freezing solid even then he cautiously lit a fire under the vehicle every morning an hour before moving off hundreds of vehicles broke down and were abandoned the planes of the luftwaffe left outside all night on makeshift airfields froze solid and refused to start and air cover for the troops simply disappeared despite all that the russians were retreating they fought hard but they were always pushed back eriks unit stopped continually to clear away russian bodies and the frozen dead stacked by the roadside made a grisly embankment relentlessly remorselessly the german army was closing in on moscow soon erik felt sure he would see panzers majestically rolling across red square while swastika banners fluttered jubilantly from the towers of the kremlin meanwhile the temperature was minus ten degrees centigrade and falling eriks field hospital unit was in a small town beside a frozen canal surrounded by spruce forest erik did not know the name of the place the russians often destroyed everything as they retreated but this town had survived more or less intact it had a modern hospital which the germans had taken over dr weiss had briskly instructed the local doctors to send their patients home regardless of condition now erik studied a frostbite patient a boy of about eighteen the skin of his face was a waxy yellow and frozen hard to the touch when erik and hermann cut away the flimsy summer uniform they saw that his arms and legs were covered with purple blisters his torn and broken boots had been stuffed with newspaper in a pathetic attempt to keep out the cold when erik took them off he smelled the characteristic rotting stink of gangrene nevertheless he thought they might yet save the boy from amputation they knew what to do they were treating more men for frostbite than for combat wounds he filled a bathtub then he and hermann braun lowered the patient into the warm water erik studied the body as it thawed he saw the black colour of gangrene on one foot and the toes of the other when the water began to cool they took him out patted him dry put him in a bed and covered him with blankets then they surrounded him with hot stones wrapped in towels the patient was conscious and alert he said am i going to lose my foot thats up to the doctor erik said automatically were just orderlies but you see a lot of patients he persisted whats your best guess i think you might be all right erik said if not he knew what would happen on the foot less badly affected weiss would amputate the toes cutting them off with a big pair of clippers like bolt cutters the other leg would be amputated below the knee weiss came a few minutes later and examined the boys feet prepare the patient for amputation he said brusquely erik was desolate another strong young man was going to spend the rest of his life a cripple what a shame but the patient saw it differently thank god he said i wont have to fight any more as they got the boy ready for surgery erik reflected that the patient was one of many who persisted in a defeatist attitude his own family among them he thought a lot about his late father and felt deep rage mingled with his grief and loss the old man would not have joined in with the majority and celebrated the triumph of the third reich he thought bitterly he would have complained about something questioned the führers judgement undermined the morale of the armed forces why had he had to be such a rebel why had he been so attached to the outdated ideology of democracy freedom had done nothing for germany whereas fascism had saved the country he was angry with his father yet hot tears came to his eyes when he thought about how he had died erik had at first denied that the gestapo had killed him but he soon realized it was probably true they were not sunday school teachers they beat people who told wicked lies about the government father had persisted in asking whether the government was killing handicapped children he had been foolish to listen to his english wife and his overemotional daughter erik loved them which made it all the more painful to him that they were so misguided and obstinate while on leave in berlin erik had gone to see hermanns father the man who had first revealed the exciting nazi philosophy to him when he and hermann were boys herr braun was in the ss now erik said he had met a man in a bar who claimed the government killed disabled people in special hospitals it is true that the handicapped are a costly drag on the forward march to the new germany herr braun had said to erik the race must be purified by repressing jews and other degenerate types and preventing mixed marriages that produce mongrel people but euthanasia has never been nazi policy we are determined tough even brutal sometimes but we do not murder people that is a communist lie fathers accusations had been wrong still erik wept sometimes fortunately he was frantically busy there was always a morning rush of patients mostly men injured the day before then there was a short lull before the first new casualties of the day when weiss had operated on the frostbitten boy he and erik and hermann took a midmorning break in the cramped staff room hermann looked up from a newspaper in berlin theyre saying weve already won he exclaimed they ought to come here and see for themselves dr weiss spoke with his usual cynicism the führer made a most interesting speech at the sportpalast he said he spoke of the bestial inferiority of the russians i find that reassuring i had the impression that the russians were the toughest fighters we have yet come across they have fought longer and harder than the poles the belgians the dutch the french or the british they may be underequipped and badly led and half starved but they come running at our machine guns waving their obsolete rifles as if they dont care whether they live or die im glad to hear that this is no more than a sign of their bestiality i was beginning to fear that they might be courageous and patriotic as always weiss pretended to agree with the führer while meaning the opposite hermann just looked confused but erik understood and was infuriated whatever the russians may be theyre losing he said were forty miles from moscow the führer has been proved right and he is much smarter than napoléon said dr weiss in napoléons time nothing could move faster than a horse said erik today we have motor vehicles and wireless telegraphy modern communications have enabled us to succeed where napoléon failed or they will have when we take moscow which we will do in a few days if not hours you can hardly doubt that can i not i believe some of our own generals have suggested we halt where we are and build a defence line we could secure our positions resupply over the winter and go back on the offensive when the spring comes that sounds to me like treacherous cowardice erik said hotly you are right you must be because that is exactly what berlin told the generals i understand headquarters people obviously have a better perspective than the men on the front line we have almost wiped out the red army but stalin seems to produce more armies from nowhere like a magician at the beginning of this campaign we thought he had two hundred divisions now we think he has more than three hundred where did he find another hundred divisions the führers judgement will be proved right again of course it will erik he has never yet been wrong a man thought he could fly so he jumped off the top of a tenstorey building and as he fell past the fifth floor flapping his arms uselessly in the air he was heard to say so far so good a soldier rushed into the staff room theres been an accident he said at the quarry north of the town a collision three vehicles some ss officers are injured the ss or schutzstaffel had originally been hitlers personal guard and now formed a powerful elite erik admired their superb discipline their ultrasmart uniforms and their specially close relationship with hitler well send an ambulance said weiss the soldier said its the einsatzgruppe the special group erik had heard of the special groups vaguely they followed the army into conquered territory and rounded up troublemakers and potential saboteurs such as communists they were probably setting up a prison camp outside the town how many hurt asked weiss six or seven theyre still getting people out of the cars okay braun and von ulrich you go erik was pleased he would be glad to rub shoulders with the führers most fervent supporters even happier if he could be of service to them the soldier handed him a message slip with directions erik and hermann gulped their tea stubbed their cigarettes and left the room erik put on a fur coat he had taken from a dead russian officer but left it open to show his uniform they hurried down to the garage and hermann drove the ambulance out into the street erik read out the directions peering through a light snowfall the road led out of town and snaked through the forest they passed several buses and trucks coming the other way the snow on the road was packed hard and hermann could not go fast on the glossy surface erik could easily imagine how there had been a collision it was the afternoon of the short day at this time of year daylight began at ten and ended at five a grey light came through the snow clouds the tall pine trees crowding in on either side darkened the road further erik felt as if he were in one of the fairy tales of the brothers grimm following the path into the deep wood where evil lurked they looked out for a turning to the left and found it guarded by a soldier who pointed the way they bumped along a treacherous path between the trees until they were waved down by a second guard who said dont go faster than walking pace thats how the crash happened a minute later they came upon the accident three damaged vehicles stood as if welded together a bus a jeep and a mercedes limousine with snow chains on the tyres erik and hermann jumped out of their ambulance the bus was empty there were three men on the ground perhaps the occupants of the jeep several soldiers gathered around the car sandwiched between the other two vehicles apparently trying to get the people out of it erik heard a volley of rifle fire and wondered for a moment who was shooting but he put the thought aside and concentrated on the job he and hermann went from one man to the next assessing the gravity of the injuries of the three people on the ground one was dead another had a broken arm and the third appeared to be no worse than bruised in the car one man had bled to death another was unconscious and a third was screaming erik gave the screamer a shot of morphine when the drug took effect he and hermann were able to get the patient out of the car and into the ambulance with him out of the way the soldiers could begin to free the unconscious man who was trapped by the deformed bodywork of the mercedes the man had a head injury that was going to kill him anyway erik thought but he did not tell them that he turned his attention to the men from the jeep hermann put a splint on the broken arm and erik walked the bruised man to the ambulance and sat him inside he returned to the mercedes well have him out in five to ten minutes said a captain just hold on okay said erik he heard shooting again and walked a little farther into the forest curious about what the special group might be doing here the snow on the ground between the trees was heavily trodden and littered with cigarette ends apple cores discarded newspapers and other litter as if a factory outing had passed this way he entered a clearing where lorries and buses were parked a lot of people had been brought here some buses were leaving skirting the accident another arrived as erik passed through beyond the car park he came upon a hundred or so russians of all ages apparently prisoners though many had suitcases boxes and sacks that they clutched as if guarding precious possessions one man held a violin a little girl with a doll caught eriks eye and he felt in his guts a sensation of sick foreboding the prisoners were being guarded by local policemen armed with truncheons clearly the special group had collaborators for whatever they were doing the policemen looked at him noted the german army uniform visible beneath the unbuttoned coat and said nothing as he walked by a welldressed russian prisoner spoke to him in german sir i am the director of the tyre factory in this town i have never believed in communism but only paid lip service as all managers had to i can help you i know where everything is please take me away from here erik ignored him and walked in the direction of the shooting he came upon the quarry it was a large irregular hole in the ground its edge fringed by tall spruce trees like guardsmen in darkgreen uniforms laden with snow at one end a long slope led into the pit as he watched a dozen prisoners began to walk down two by two marshalled by soldiers into the shadowed valley erik noticed three women and a boy of about eleven among them was their prison camp somewhere in that quarry but they were no longer carrying luggage snow fell on their bare heads like a benison erik spoke to an ss sergeant standing nearby who are these prisoners sarge communists said the man from the town political commissars and so on what even that little boy jews too said the sergeant well what are they communists or jews whats the difference its not the same thing balls most communists are jews most jews are communists dont you know anything the tyre factory director who had spoken to erik seemed to be neither he thought the prisoners reached the rocky floor of the quarry until this moment they had shuffled along like sheep in a herd not speaking or looking around but now they became animated pointing at something on the ground peering through the snowflakes erik saw what looked like bodies scattered among the rocks snow dusting their garments for the first time erik noticed twelve riflemen standing on the lip of the ravine among the trees twelve prisoners twelve riflemen he realized what was happening here and incredulity mixed with horror rose like bile inside him they raised their guns and aimed at the prisoners no erik said no you cant nobody heard him a woman prisoner screamed erik saw her grab the elevenyearold boy and clasp him to herself as if her arms around him could stop bullets she seemed to be his mother an officer said fire the rifles cracked the prisoners staggered and fell the noise dislodged a little snow from the pines and it fell on the riflemen a sprinkling of pure white erik saw the boy and his mother drop still locked together in an embrace no he said oh no the sergeant looked at him whats the matter with you he said irritably who are you anyway medical orderly said erik without taking his eyes off the dread scene in the pit what are you doing here i brought an ambulance for the officers hurt in the collision erik saw that another twelve prisoners were already being marched down the slope into the quarry oh god my father was right he moaned were murdering people stop whining and fuck off back to your ambulance yes sergeant said erik iii at the end of november volodya asked for a transfer to a fighting unit his intelligence work no longer seemed important the red army did not need spies in berlin to discover the intentions of a german army that was already on the outskirts of moscow and he wanted to fight for his city his misgivings about the government came to seem trivial stalins stupidity the brutishness of the secret police the way nothing in the soviet union worked the way it was supposed to work all that faded away he felt nothing but a blazing need to repel the invader who threatened to bring violence rape starvation and death to his mother his sister the twins dimka and tania and zoya he was sharply aware that if everyone thought that way he would have no spies his german informants were people who had decided that patriotism and loyalty were outweighed by the terrible wickedness of the nazis he was grateful to them for their courage and the stern morality that drove them but he felt differently so did many of the younger men in red army intelligence and a small company of them joined a rifle battalion at the beginning of december volodya kissed his parents wrote a note to zoya saying he hoped to survive to see her again and moved into barracks at long last stalin brought reinforcements from the east to moscow thirteen siberian divisions were deployed against the evernearer germans on their way to the front line some of them stopped briefly in moscow and muscovites on the streets stared at them in their white padded coats and warm sheepskin boots with their skis and goggles and hardy steppe ponies they arrived in time for the russian counterattack this was the red armys last chance time and time again in the last five months the soviet union had hurled hundreds of thousands of men at the invaders each time the germans had paused dealt with the attack and continued their relentless advance but if this attempt failed there would be no more the germans would have moscow and when they had moscow they would have the ussr and then his mother would be trading vodka for blackmarket milk for dimka and tania on the fourth day of december the soviet forces moved out of the city to the north west and south and took up their positions for the last effort they went without lights to avoid alerting the enemy they were not allowed to have fires or smoke tobacco that evening the front line was visited by nkvd agents volodya did not see his rodentfaced brotherinlaw ilya dvorkin who must have been among them a pair he did not recognize came to the bivouac where volodya and a dozen men were cleaning their rifles have you heard anyone criticizing the government they asked what do the fellows say about comrade stalin who among your comrades questions the wisdom of the armys strategy and tactics volodya was incredulous what did it matter at this point in the next few days moscow would be saved or lost who cared if soldiers bitched about their officers he cut the questioning short saying that he and his men were under a rule of silence and he had orders to shoot anyone who broke it but he added recklessly he would let the secret policemen off if they left immediately that worked but volodya had no doubt that the nkvd was undermining the morale of the troops all along the line on friday december in the evening the russian artillery thundered into action next morning at dawn volodya and his battalion moved off in a blizzard their orders were to take a small town on the far side of a canal volodya ignored orders to attack the german defences frontally that was the oldfashioned russian tactic and this was no moment to stick obstinately to wrongheaded ideas with his company of a hundred men he went upstream and crossed the ice to the north of the town then moved in on the germans flank he could hear the crash and roar of battle off to his left so he knew he was behind the enemys front line volodya was almost blinded by the blizzard the occasional blaze of gunfire lit up the clouds for a moment but at ground level visibility was only a few yards however he thought optimistically that would help the russians creep up on the germans and take them by surprise it was viciously cold down to minus centigrade in places and while this was bad for both sides it was worse for the germans who lacked coldweather supplies somewhat to his surprise volodya found that the normally efficient germans had not consolidated their line there were no trenches no antitank ditches no dugouts their front was no more than a series of strongpoints it was easy to slip through the gaps into the town and look for soft targets barracks and canteens and ammunition dumps his men shot three sentries to take a soccer field in which were parked fifty tanks could it be so easy volodya wondered was the force that had conquered half russia now depleted and spent the corpses of soviet soldiers killed in previous skirmishes and left to freeze where they had died were without their boots and coats which had presumably been taken by shivering germans the streets of the town were littered with abandoned vehicles empty trucks with open doors snowcovered tanks with cold engines and jeeps with their bonnet lids propped up as if to show that mechanics had tried to fix them but had given up in despair crossing a main road volodya heard a car engine and made out through the snowfall a pair of headlights approaching on his left at first he assumed it was a soviet vehicle that had pushed through the german lines then he and his group were fired on and he yelled at them to take cover the car turned out to be a kubelwagen a volkswagen jeep with the spare wheel on the hood in front it had an aircooled engine which was why it had not frozen up it rattled past them at top speed the germans firing from their seats volodya was so surprised that he forgot to fire back why was a vehicle full of armed germans driving away from the battle he took his company across the road he had expected that by now they would be fighting their way from house to house but they met little opposition the buildings of the occupied town were locked up shuttered dark any russians inside were hiding under their beds if they had any sense more cars came along the road and volodya decided that officers must be fleeing the battlefield he detailed a section with a degtyarev dp light machine gun to take cover in a café and fire on them he did not want them to live to kill russians tomorrow just off the main road he spotted a low brick building with bright lights behind skimpy curtains creeping past a sentry who could not see far in the snowstorm he was able to peer in and discern officers inside he guessed he was looking at a battalion headquarters he gave whispered instructions to his sergeants they shot out the windows then tossed grenades through a few germans came out with their hands on their heads a minute later volodya had taken the building he heard a new noise he listened frowning in puzzlement more than anything else it sounded like a football crowd he stepped out of the headquarters building the sound was coming from the front line and it was growing louder there was a rattle of machinegun fire then a hundred yards away on the main road a truck slewed sideways and careered off the road into a brick wall then burst into flames hit presumably by the dp volodya had deployed two more vehicles followed immediately behind it and escaped volodya ran to the café the machine gun stood on its bipod on a dining table this model was nicknamed record player because of the discshaped magazine that sat atop the barrel the men were enjoying themselves its like shooting pigeons in the yard sir said a gunner easy one of the men had raided the kitchen and found a big canister of ice cream miraculously unspoiled and they were taking turns to scoff it volodya looked out through the smashed window of the café he saw another vehicle coming a jeep he thought and behind it some men running as they got nearer he recognized german uniforms more followed behind dozens perhaps hundreds they were responsible for the footballcrowd sound the gunner trained the barrel on the oncoming car but volodya put a hand on his shoulder wait he said he stared into the blizzard making his eyes sting all he could see was more vehicles and more running men plus a few horses a soldier raised a rifle dont shoot volodya said the crowd came closer we cant stop this lot wed be overrun in a minute he said let them pass take cover the men lay down the gunner lifted the dp off the table volodya sat on the floor and peered over the windowsill the noise rose to a roar the leading men drew level with the café and passed they were running stumbling and limping some carried rifles most seemed to have lost their weapons some had coats and hats others nothing but their uniform tunics many were wounded volodya saw a man with a bandaged head fall down crawl a few yards and collapse no one took any notice a cavalryman on horseback trampled an infantryman and galloped on heedless jeeps and staff cars drove dangerously through the crowd skidding on the ice honking madly and scattering men to both sides it was a rout volodya realized they went by in their thousands it was a stampede they were on the run at last the germans were in retreat iv woody dewar and joanne rouzrokh flew from oakland california to honolulu on a boeing b flying boat the pan am flight took fourteen hours just before arriving they had a massive row perhaps it was spending so long in a small space the flying boat was one of the biggest planes in the world but passengers sat in one of six small cabins each of which had two facing rows of four seats i prefer the train said woody awkwardly crossing his long legs and joanne had the grace not to point out that you could not go to hawaii by train the trip was woodys parents idea they had decided to take a vacation in hawaii so they could see woodys younger brother chuck who was stationed there then they invited woody and joanne to join them for the second week of the holiday woody and joanne were engaged woody had proposed at the end of the summer after four weeks of hot weather and passionate love in washington joanne had said it was too soon but woody had pointed out that he had been in love with her for six years and asked how long would be enough she had given in they would get married next june as soon as woody graduated from harvard meanwhile their engaged status entitled them to go on family holidays together she called him woods and he called her jo the plane began to lose height as they approached oahu the main island they could see forested mountains a sparse scatter of villages in the lowlands and a fringe of sand and surf i bought a new swimsuit joanne said they were sitting side by side and the roar of the four wright twin cyclone cylinder engines was too loud for her to be overheard woody was reading the grapes of wrath but he put it down willingly i cant wait to see you in it he meant it she was a swimsuit manufacturers dream making all their products look sensational she glanced at him from under halfclosed eyelids i wonder if your parents booked us adjoining rooms at the hotel her darkbrown eyes seemed to smoulder their engaged status did not allow them to sleep together at least not officially though woodys mother did not miss much and she might have guessed they were lovers woody said ill find you wherever you are youd better dont talk like that im already uncomfortable enough in this seat she smiled contentedly the american naval base came into view a lagoon shaped like a palm leaf formed a large natural harbour half the pacific fleet was here about a hundred ships the rows of fuel storage tanks looked like checkers on a board in the middle of the lagoon was an island with an airstrip at the western end of the island woody saw a dozen or more seaplanes moored right next to the lagoon was hickam air base several hundred aircraft were parked with military precision wingtip to wingtip on the tarmac banking for its approach the plane flew over a beach with palm trees and gaily striped umbrellas which woody guessed must be waikiki then a small town that had to be honolulu the capital joanne was owed some leave by the state department but woody had had to skip a week of classes in order to take this vacation im kind of surprised at your father joanne said hes usually against anything that interrupts your education i know said woody but you know the real reason for this trip jo he thinks it could be the last time we see chuck alive oh my god really he thinks theres going to be a war and chuck is in the navy i think hes right there will be a war what makes you so sure the whole world is hostile to freedom she pointed to the book in her lap a bestseller called berlin diary by the radio broadcaster william shirer the nazis have europe she said the bolsheviks have russia and now the japanese are taking control of the far east i dont see how america can survive in such a world we have to trade with somebody thats pretty much what my father thinks he believes well go to war against japan next year woody frowned thoughtfully whats happening in russia the germans dont seem quite able to take moscow just before i left there was a rumour of a massive russian counterattack good news woody looked out he could see honolulu airport the plane would splash down in a sheltered inlet alongside the runway he presumed joanne said i hope nothing major happens while im away why i want a promotion woods so i dont want someone bright and promising to shine in my absence promotion you didnt say i dont have it yet but im aiming for research officer he smiled how high do you want to go id like to be ambassador to someplace fascinating and complex nanking or addis ababa really dont look sceptical frances perkins is the first woman secretary of labour and a damn good one woody nodded perkins had been labor secretary from the start of roosevelts presidency eight years ago and had won union support for the new deal an exceptional woman could aspire to almost anything nowadays and joanne was truly exceptional but somehow it came as a shock to him that she was so ambitious but an ambassador has to live overseas he said wouldnt it be great foreign culture weird weather exotic customs but how does that fit in with marriage excuse me she said with asperity he shrugged its a natural question dont you think her expression did not change except that her nostrils flared a sign he knew that she was getting angry have i asked you that question she said no but well im just wondering jo do you expect me to live wherever your career takes you ill try to fit in with your needs and i think you should try to fit in with mine but its not the same isnt it she was openly annoyed now this is news to me he wondered how the conversation had become so acrimonious so quickly with an effort at making his tone of voice reasonable and amiable he said weve talked about having children havent we youll have them as well as me not in exactly the same way if children are going to make me a secondclass citizen in this marriage then were not having any thats not what i mean what the heck do you mean if youre appointed ambassador somewhere do you expect me to drop everything and go with you i expect you to say my darling this is a wonderful opportunity for you and im certainly not going to stand in your way is that unreasonable yes woody was baffled and angry whats the point of being married if were not together if war breaks out will you volunteer i guess i might and the army would send you wherever they needed you europe the far east well yes so youll go where your duty takes you and leave me at home if i have to but i cant do that its not the same why are you pretending it is strangely enough my career and my service to my country seem important to me just as important as yours to you youre just being perverse well woods im really sorry you think that because ive been talking very seriously about our future together now i have to ask myself whether we even have one of course we do woody could have screamed with frustration how did this happen how did we get to this there was a bump and the plane splashed down in hawaii ii chuck dewar was terrified that his parents would learn his secret back home in buffalo he had never had a real love affair just a few hasty fumbles in dark alleys with boys he hardly knew half the reason he had joined the navy was to go places where he could be himself without his parents finding out since he got to hawaii it had been different here he was part of an underground community of similar people he went to bars and restaurants and dance halls where he did not have to pretend to be heterosexual he had had some affairs and then he had fallen in love a lot of people knew his secret and now his parents were here his father was invited to visit the signal intelligence unit at the naval base known as station hypo as a member of the senate foreign relations committee senator dewar was let into many military secrets and he had already been shown around signals intelligence headquarters called opg in washington chuck picked him up at his hotel in honolulu in a navy car a packard lebaron limousine papa was wearing a white straw hat as they drove around the rim of the harbour he whistled the pacific fleet he said a beautiful sight chuck agreed quite something isnt it he said ships were beautiful especially in the us navy where they were painted and scrubbed and shined chuck thought the navy was great all those battleships in a perfect straight line gus marvelled we call it battleship row moored off the island are maryland tennessee arizona nevada oklahoma and west virginia battleships were named after states we also have california and pennsylvania in harbour but you cant see them from here at the main gate to the navy yard the marine on sentry duty recognized the official car and waved them in they drove to the submarine base and stopped in the parking lot behind headquarters the old administration building chuck took his father into the recently opened new wing captain vandermeier was waiting for them vandermeier was chucks greatest fear he had taken a dislike to chuck and he had guessed the secret he was always calling chuck a powder puff or a pantywaist if he could he would spill the beans vandermeier was a short stocky man with a gravelly voice and bad breath he saluted gus and shook hands welcome senator itll be my privilege to show you the communications intelligence unit of the fourteenth naval district this was the deliberately vague title for the group monitoring the radio signals of the imperial japanese navy thank you captain said gus a word of warning first sir its an informal group this kind of work is often done by eccentric people and correct naval uniform is not always worn the officer in charge commander rochefort wears a red velvet jacket vandermeier gave a mantoman grin you may think he looks like a goddamn homo chuck tried not to wince vandermeier said i wont say any more until were in the secure zone very good said gus they went down the stairs and into the basement passing through two locked doors on the way station hypo was a windowless neonlit cellar housing thirty men as well as the usual desks and chairs it had oversized chart desks racks of exotic ibm machine printers sorters and collators and two cots where the cryptanalysts took naps during their marathon codebreaking sessions some of the men wore neat uniforms but others as vandermeier had warned were in scruffy civilian clothing unshaven and to judge by the smell unwashed like all navies the japanese have many different codes using the simplest for less secret signals such as weather reports and saving the complex ones for the most highly sensitive messages vandermeier said for example call signs identifying the sender of a message and its destination are in a primitive cipher even when the text itself is in a highgrade cipher they recently changed the code for call signs but we cracked the new one in a few days very impressive said gus we can also figure out where the signal originated by triangulation given locations and the call signs we can build up a pretty good picture of where most of the ships of the japanese navy are even if we cant read the messages so we know where they are and what direction theyre taking but not what their orders are said gus frequently yes but if they wanted to hide from us all they would have to do is impose radio silence true said vandermeier if they go quiet this whole operation becomes useless and we are well and truly fucked up the ass a man in a smoking jacket and carpet slippers approached and vandermeier introduced the head of the unit commander rochefort is fluent in japanese as well as being a master cryptanalyst vandermeier said we were making good progress decrypting the main japanese cipher until a few days ago rochefort said then the bastards changed it and undid all our work gus said captain vandermeier was telling me you can learn a lot without actually reading the messages yes rochefort pointed to a wall chart right now most of the japanese fleet has left home waters and is heading south ominous it sure is but tell me senator whats your reading of japanese intentions i believe they will declare war on the united states our oil embargo is really hurting them the british and the dutch are refusing to supply them and right now theyre trying to ship it from south america they cant survive like this indefinitely vandermeier said but what would they achieve by attacking us a little country such as japan cant invade the usa gus said great britain is a little country but they achieved world domination just by ruling the seas the japanese dont have to conquer america they just need to defeat us in a naval war so that they can control the pacific and no one can stop them trading so in your opinion what might they be doing heading south their likeliest target has to be the philippines rochefort nodded agreement weve already reinforced our base there but one thing bothers me the commander of the japanese aircraft carrier fleet hasnt received any signals for several days gus frowned radio silence has that ever happened before yes aircraft carriers go quiet when they return to home waters so we assume thats the explanation this time gus nodded it sounds reasonable yes said rochefort i just wish i could be sure iii the christmas lights were ablaze on fort street in honolulu it was saturday night december and the street was thronged with sailors in white tropical uniform each with a round white cap and a crossed black scarf all out for a good time the dewar family strolled along enjoying the atmosphere rosa on chucks arm and gus and woody on either side of joanne woody had patched up his quarrel with his fiancée he apologized for making wrong assumptions about what joanne expected in their marriage joanne admitted she had flown off the handle nothing was truly resolved but it was enough of a rapprochement for them to tear off their clothes and jump into bed afterwards the quarrel seemed less important and nothing really mattered except how much they loved each other then they vowed that in future they would discuss such agreements in a loving and tolerant way as they got dressed woody felt that they had passed a milestone they had had an acrimonious quarrel about a serious difference of view but they had survived it it could even be a good sign now they were heading out for dinner woody carrying his camera snapping photos of the scene as they walked along before they had gone far chuck stopped and introduced another sailor this is my pal eddie parry eddie meet senator dewar mrs dewar my brother woody and woodys fiancée miss joanne rouzrokh rosa said im pleased to meet you eddie chuck has mentioned you several times in his letters home wont you join us for dinner were only going to eat chinese woody was surprised it was not like his mother to invite a stranger to a family meal eddie said thank you maam id be honoured he had a southern accent they went into the heavenly delight restaurant and sat down at a table for six eddie had formal manners calling gus sir and the women maam but he seemed relaxed after they had ordered he said ive heard so much about this family i feel as if i know yall he had a freckled face and a big smile and woody could tell that everyone liked him eddie asked rosa how she liked hawaii to tell you the truth im a little disappointed she said honolulu is just like any small american town i expected it to be more asian i agree said eddie its all diners and motor courts and jazz bands he asked gus if there was going to be a war everyone asked gus that question weve tried our darnedest to reach a modus vivendi with japan gus said woody wondered if eddie knew what a modus vivendi was secretary of state hull had a whole series of talks with ambassador nomura that lasted all summer long but we cant seem to agree whats the problem said eddie american business needs a free trade zone in the far east japan says okay fine we love free trade lets have it not just in our backyard but all over the world the united states cant deliver that even if we wanted it so japan says that as long as other countries have their own economic zone they need one too i still dont see why they had to invade china rosa who always tried to see the other side said the japanese want troops in china and indochina and the dutch east indies to protect their interests just as we americans have troops in the philippines and the british have theirs in india and the french in algeria and so on when you put it that way the japs dont seem so unreasonable joanne said firmly theyre not unreasonable but theyre wrong conquering an empire is the nineteenthcentury solution the world is changing were moving away from empires and closed economic zones to give them what they want would be a backward step their food arrived before i forget gus said were having breakfast tomorrow morning aboard the arizona eight oclock sharp chuck said im not invited but ive been detailed to get you there ill pick you up at seventhirty and drive you to the navy yard then take you across the harbour in a launch fine woody tucked in to fried rice this is great he said we should have chinese food at our wedding gus laughed i dont think so why not its cheap and it tastes good a wedding is more than a meal its an occasion speaking of which joanne i must call your mother joanne frowned about the wedding about the guest list joanne put down her chopsticks is there a problem woody saw her nostrils flare and knew there was going to be trouble not really a problem said gus i have a rather large number of friends and allies in washington who would be offended if they were not invited to the wedding of my son im going to suggest that your mother and i share the cost papa was being thoughtful woody guessed because dave had sold his business for a bargain price before he died joannes mother might not have a lot of money to spare for a swanky wedding but joanne disliked the idea of the two parents making wedding arrangements over her head who are the friends and allies youre thinking about joanne said coolly senators and congressmen mostly we must invite the president but he wont come which senators and congressmen joanne asked woody saw his mother hide a grin she was amused at joannes insistence not many people had the nerve to push gus up against the wall like this gus began a list of names joanne interrupted him did you say congressman cobb yes he voted against the antilynching law peter cobb is a good man but hes a mississippi politician we live in a democracy joanne we have to represent our voters southerners wont support an antilynching law he looked at chucks friend i hope im not treading on any toes here eddie dont mince your words on my account sir eddie said im from texas but i feel ashamed when i think of southern politics i hate prejudice a mans a man whatever his colour woody glanced at chuck he looked so proud of eddie he might have burst at that moment woody realized that eddie was more than just chucks pal that was weird there were three loving couples around the table papa and mama woody and joanne and chuck and eddie he stared at eddie chucks lover he thought damn weird eddie caught him staring and smiled amiably woody tore his gaze away thank god papa and mama havent figured it out he thought unless that was why mama had invited eddie to join in a family dinner did she know did she even approve no that was beyond the bounds of possibility anyway cobb has no choice papa was saying and in everything else hes a liberal theres nothing democratic about it joanne said hotly cobb doesnt represent the people of the south only white people are allowed to vote there gus said nothing is perfect in this life cobb supported roosevelts new deal that doesnt mean i have to invite him to my wedding woody put in papa i dont want him either he has blood on his hands thats unfair its how we feel well the decision is not entirely up to you joannes mother will be throwing the party and if shell let me ill share the cost i guess that gives us at least a say in the guest list woody sat back heck its our wedding joanne looked at woody maybe we should have a quiet town hall wedding with just a few friends woody shrugged suits me gus said severely that would upset a lot of people but not us said woody the most important person of the day is the bride i just want her to have what she wants rosa spoke up listen to me everyone she said dont lets go overboard gus my darling you may have to take peter cobb aside and explain to him gently that you are lucky enough to have an idealistic son who is marrying a wonderful and equally idealistic girl and they have stubbornly refused your impassioned request to invite congressman cobb to the wedding youre sorry but you cannot follow your own inclinations in this any more than peter can follow his when voting on antilynching bills he will smile and say he understands and he has always liked you because youre as straight as a die gus hesitated for a long moment then decided to give in graciously i guess youre right my dear he said he smiled at joanne anyway id be a fool to quarrel with my delightful daughterinlaw on account of pete cobb joanne said thank you should i start calling you papa yet woody almost gasped it was the perfect thing to say she was so damn smart gus said i would really like that woody thought he saw the glint of a tear in his fathers eye joanne said then thank you papa how about that thought woody she stood up to him and she won what a girl iv on sunday morning eddie wanted to go with chuck to pick up the family at their hotel i dont know baby said chuck you and i are supposed to be friendly not inseparable they were in bed in a motel at dawn they had to sneak back into barracks before sunup youre ashamed of me said eddie how can you say that i took you to dinner with my family that was your mamas idea not yours but your papa liked me didnt he they all adored you who wouldnt but they dont know youre a filthy homo i am not a filthy homo im a very clean homo true please take me i want to know them better its really important to me chuck sighed okay thank you eddie kissed him do we have time chuck grinned if were quick two hours later they were outside the hotel in the navys packard their four passengers appeared at seventhirty rosa and joanne wore hats and gloves gus and woody white linen suits woody had his camera woody and joanne were holding hands look at my brother chuck murmured to eddie hes so happy shes a beautiful girl they held the doors open and the dewars climbed into the back of the limousine woody and joanne folded down the jump seats chuck pulled away and headed for the naval base it was a fine morning on the car radio station kgmb was playing hymns the sun shone over the lagoon and glinted off the glass portholes and polished brass rails of a hundred ships chuck said isnt that a pretty sight they entered the base and drove to the navy yard where a dozen ships were in floating docks and dry docks for repair maintenance and refuelling chuck pulled up at the officers landing they all got out and looked across the lagoon at the mighty battleships standing proud in the morning light woody took a photo it was a few minutes before eight oclock chuck could hear the tolling of church bells in nearby pearl city on the ships the forenoon watch was being piped to breakfast and colour parties were assembling to hoist ensigns at eight precisely a band on the deck of the nevada was playing the starspangled banner they walked to the jetty where a launch was tied up ready for them the boat was big enough to take a dozen passengers and had an inboard motor under a hatch in the stern eddie started the engine while chuck handed the guests into the boat the small motor burbled cheerfully chuck stood in the bows while eddie eased the launch away from the dockside and turned towards the battleships the prow lifted as the launch picked up speed throwing off twin curves of foam like a seagulls wings chuck heard a plane and looked up it was coming in from the west so low it looked as if it might be in danger of crashing he assumed it was about to land at the naval airstrip on ford island woody sitting near chuck in the bows frowned and said what kind of plane is that chuck knew every aircraft of both the army and the navy but he had trouble identifying this one it almost looks like a type ninetyseven he said that was the carrierbased torpedo bomber of the imperial japanese navy woody pointed his camera as the plane came nearer chuck saw large red suns painted on its wings it is a jap plane he said eddie steering the boat from the stern heard him they must have faked it up for an exercise he said a surprise drill to spoil everyones sunday morning i guess so said chuck then he saw a second plane behind the first and another he heard his father say anxiously what the heck is going on the planes banked over the navy yard and passed low over the launch their noise rising to a roar like niagara falls there were about ten of them chuck saw no twenty no more they headed straight for battleship row woody stopped taking pictures to say it cant be a real attack can it there was fear as well as doubt in his voice how could they be japanese chuck said incredulously japan is nearly four thousand miles away no plane can fly that far then he remembered that the aircraft carriers of the japanese navy had gone into radio silence the signal intelligence unit had assumed they were in home waters but had never been able to confirm that he caught his fathers eye and guessed he was remembering the same conversation everything suddenly became clear and incredulity turned to fear the lead plane flew low over the nevada the stern marker in battleship row there was a burst of cannon fire on deck seamen scattered and the band left off in a ragged diminuendo of abandoned notes in the launch rosa screamed eddie said christ jesus in heaven its an attack chucks heart pounded the japanese were bombing pearl harbor and he was in a small boat in the middle of the lagoon he looked at the scared faces of the others both parents his brother and eddie and realized that all the people he loved were in the boat with him long bulletshaped torpedoes began to fall from the underbellies of the planes and splash into the tranquil waters of the lagoon chuck yelled turn back eddie but eddie was already doing it swinging the launch around in a tight arc as it turned chuck saw over hickam air base another flight of aircraft with the big red discs on their wings these were dive bombers and they were streaming down like birds of prey on the rows of american aircraft perfectly lined up on the runways how the hell many of the bastards were there half the japanese air force seemed to be in the sky over pearl woody was still taking pictures chuck heard a deep bang like an underground explosion then another immediately after he spun around there was a flash of flame aboard the arizona and smoke began to rise from her the stern of the launch squatted farther into the water as eddie opened the throttle chuck said unnecessarily hurry hurry from one of the ships chuck heard the insistent rhythmic hoot of a klaxon sounding general quarters calling the crew to battle stations and he realized that this was a battle and his family was in the middle of it a moment later on ford island the airraid siren began with a low moan and wailed higher in pitch until it struck its frantic top note there was a long series of explosions from battleship row as torpedoes found their targets eddie yelled look at the wee vee it was what they called the west virginia shes listing to port he was right chuck saw the ship had been holed on the side nearest the attacking planes millions of tons of water must have poured into her in a few seconds to make such a huge vessel tilt sideways next to her the same fate was overtaking the oklahoma and to his horror chuck could see sailors slipping helplessly sliding across the tilted deck and falling over the side into the water waves from the explosions rocked the launch everyone clung to the sides chuck saw bombs rain down on the seaplane base at the near end of ford island the planes were moored close together and the fragile aircraft were blown to pieces fragments of wings and fuselages flying into the air like leaves in a hurricane chucks intelligencetrained mind was trying to identify aircraft types and now he spotted a third model among the japanese attackers the deadly mitsubishi zero the best carrierbased fighter in the world it had only two small bombs but was armed with twin machine guns and a pair of mm cannon its role in this attack must be to escort the bombers defending them from american fighters but all the american fighters were still on the ground where many of them had already been destroyed that left the zeroes free to strafe buildings equipment and troops or chuck thought fearfully to strafe a family crossing the lagoon desperately trying to get to shore at last the united states began to shoot back on ford island and on the decks of the ships that had not yet been hit antiaircraft guns and regular machine guns came to life adding their rattle to the cacophony of lethal noise antiaircraft shells burst in the sky like black flowers blossoming almost immediately a machinegunner on the island scored a direct hit on a divebomber the cockpit burst into flames and the plane hit the water with a mighty splash chuck found himself cheering savagely shaking his fists in the air the listing west virginia began to return to the vertical but continued to sink and chuck realized that the commander must have opened the starboard seacocks to ensure that she remained upright while she went down giving the crew a better chance of survival but the oklahoma was not so fortunate and they all watched in terrified awe as the great ship began to turn over joanne said oh god look at the crew the sailors were frantically scrambling up the steeply banked deck and over the starboard rail in a desperate attempt to save themselves but they were the lucky ones chuck realized as at last the mighty vessel turned turtle with a terrible crash and began to sink for how many hundreds of men were trapped below decks hold on everyone chuck yelled a huge wave created by the capsize of the oklahoma was approaching papa grabbed mama and woody held on to joanne the wave reached them and lifted the launch impossibly high chuck staggered but kept hold of the rail the launch stayed afloat smaller waves followed rocking them but everyone was safe they were still a long quarter of a mile offshore chuck saw with consternation astonishingly the nevada which had been strafed at the start began to move off someone must have had the presence of mind to signal all ships to sail if they could get out of the harbour they could scatter and present less easy targets then from battleship row came a bang ten times bigger than anything that had gone before the explosion was so violent that chuck felt the blast like a blow to his chest though he was now almost half a mile away a spurt of flame spewed out of the no gun turret of the arizona a splitsecond later the forward half of the ship seemed to burst debris flew into the air twisted steel girders and warped plates drifting up through the smoke with a nightmare slowness like scraps of charred paper from a bonfire flames and smoke enveloped the front of the ship the lofty mast tipped forward drunkenly woody said what was that the ships ammunition store must have gone up chuck said and he realized with heartfelt grief that hundreds of his fellow seamen must have been killed in that mammoth detonation a column of darkred smoke rose into the air as from a funeral pyre there was a crash and the boat lurched as something hit it everyone ducked falling to his knees chuck thought it must be a bomb then realized it could not be for he was still alive when he recovered he saw that a heavy scrap of metal debris a yard long had pierced the deck over the engine it was a miracle it had not hit anyone however the engine died the boat slowed and was becalmed it wallowed in the choppy waves while japanese planes rained hell fire on the lagoon gus said tightly chuck we have to get out of here right now i know chuck and eddie examined the damage they grabbed the metal scrap and tried to wrestle it out of the teak deck but it was firmly stuck we dont have time for this gus said woody said the engine is blitzed anyway chuck they were still a quarter of a mile from shore however the launch was equipped for an emergency such as this chuck unshipped a pair of oars he took one and eddie took the other the boat was large for rowing and their progress was slow luckily for them there was a lull in the attack the sky was no longer swarming with planes vast billows of smoke rose from the damaged ships including a column a thousand feet high from the fatally wounded arizona but there were no new explosions the amazingly plucky nevada was now heading for the mouth of the harbour the water around the ships was crowded with life rafts motor launches and seamen swimming or clinging to floating wreckage drowning was not their only fear oil from the holed ships had spread across the surface and caught fire the cries for help of those who could not swim mingled horrifyingly with the screams of the burned chuck stole a glance at his watch he thought the attack had been going on for hours but amazingly it was only thirty minutes just as he was thinking that the second wave began this time the planes came from the east some of them chased the escaping nevada others targeted the navy yard where the dewars had boarded the launch almost immediately the destroyer shaw in a floating dock exploded with great gouts of flame and billows of smoke oil spread across the water and caught fire then in the largest dry dock the battleship pennsylvania was hit two destroyers in the same dry dock blew up as their ammunition stores were ignited chuck and eddie strained at the oars sweating like racehorses at the navy yard marines appeared presumably from the nearby barracks and broke out firefighting gear at last the launch reached the officers landing chuck leaped out and swiftly tied up while eddie helped the passengers out they all ran to the car chuck jumped into the driving seat and started the engine the car radio came on automatically and he heard the kgmb announcer say all army navy and marine personnel report for duty immediately chuck had not had a chance to report to anyone but he felt sure that his orders would be first to ensure the safety of the four civilians in his care especially as two were women and one was a senator as soon as everyone was in the car he pulled away the second wave of the attack seemed to be ending most of the japanese planes were heading away from the harbour all the same chuck drove fast there might be a third wave the main gate was open if it had been shut he would have been tempted to crash it there was no other traffic he raced away from the harbour along kamehameha highway the farther he got from pearl harbor the safer his family would be he figured then he saw a lone zero coming towards him it was flying low and following the highway and after a moment he realized it was targeting the car the cannon were in the wings and there was a good chance they would miss the narrow target of the car but the machine guns were set close together either side of the engine cowling that was what the pilot would use if he was smart chuck looked frantically at both sides of the road there was no hiding place nothing but cane fields he began to zigzag the approaching pilot sensibly did not attempt to track him the road was not wide and if chuck drove into the cane field the car would be slowed to a walking pace he stepped on the gas realizing that the faster he was going the better his chances of not being hit then it was too late for forethought the plane was so close chuck could see the round black holes in the wings through which the cannon fired but as he had guessed the pilot opened up with machine guns and bullets spat dust from the road ahead chuck moved left to the crown of the road then instead of continuing left he swerved right the pilot corrected bullets hit the hood the windscreen smashed eddie roared with pain and in the back one of the women screamed then the zero was gone the car began to zigzag of its own accord a forward wheel must have been damaged chuck fought with the steering wheel trying to stay on the road the car slewed sideways skidded across the tarmac crashed into the field at the side of the road and bumped to a stop flames rose from the engine and chuck smelled gasoline everybody out chuck yelled before the fuel tank blows he opened his door and leaped out he yanked open the rear door and his father jumped out pulling his mother along chuck could see the others getting out on the far side run he shouted but it was superfluous eddie was already heading into the cane field limping as though wounded woody was half pulling half carrying joanne who also seemed to have been hit his parents charged into the field apparently unhurt he joined them they all ran a hundred yards then threw themselves flat there was a moment of stillness the sounds of planes had become a distant buzz glancing up chuck saw oily smoke from the harbour rising thousands of feet into the air above that the last few highlevel bombers were heading away to the north then there was a bang that stunned his eardrums even with closed eyes he saw the bright flash of exploding gasoline a wave of heat passed over him he lifted his head and looked back the car was ablaze he jumped to his feet mama are you okay miraculously unhurt she said coolly as his father helped her up he scanned the field and spotted the others he ran to eddie who was sitting upright clutching his thigh are you hit hurts like fuck eddie said but theres not much blood he managed a grin top of my thigh i think but no vital organs damaged well get you to hospital at that moment chuck heard a terrible noise his brother was crying woody was weeping not like a baby but like a lost child a loud sobbing noise of utter wretchedness chuck knew immediately that it was the sound of a broken heart he ran to his brother woody was on his knees his chest shaking his mouth open his eyes running with tears there was blood all over his white linen suit but he was not wounded between sobs he moaned no no joanne lay on the ground in front of him face up chuck could see right away that she was dead her body was still and her eyes were open staring at nothing the front of her gaily striped cotton dress was soaked with bright red arterial blood already darkening in patches chuck could not see the wound but he guessed she had taken a bullet to the shoulder that had opened her axillary artery she would have bled to death in minutes he did not know what to say the others came and stood by him mama papa and eddie mama knelt on the ground beside woody and put her arms around him my poor boy she said as if he was a child eddie put his arm around chucks shoulders and gave him a discreet hug papa knelt by the body he reached out and took woodys hand woodys sobs quieted a little papa said close her eyes woody woodys hand was shaking with an effort he steadied it he stretched out his fingertips to her eyelids then with infinite gentleness he closed her eyes i on the first day of daisy got a letter from her former fiancé charlie farquharson when she opened it she was at the breakfast table in the mayfair house alone except for the aged butler who poured her coffee and the fifteenyearold maid who brought her hot toast from the kitchen charlie wrote not from buffalo but from raf duxford an air base in the east of england daisy had heard of the place it was near cambridge where she had met both her husband boy fitzherbert and the man she loved lloyd williams she was pleased to hear from charlie he had jilted her of course and she had hated him then but it was a long time ago she felt like a different person now in she had been an american heiress called miss peshkov today she was viscountess aberowen an english aristocrat all the same she was pleased she was still in charlies mind a woman would always prefer to be remembered than forgotten charlie wrote with a heavy black pen his handwriting was untidy the letters large and jagged daisy read before anything else i need of course to apologize for the way i treated you back in buffalo i shudder with mortification every time i think of it good lord thought daisy he seems to have grown up what snobs we all were and how weak i was to allow my late mother to bully me into behaving shabbily ah she thought his late mother so the old bitch is dead that might explain the change i have joined no eagle squadron we fly hurricanes but were getting spitfires any day now there were three eagle squadrons royal air force units manned by american volunteers daisy was surprised she would not have expected charlie to go to war voluntarily when she knew him he had been interested in nothing but dogs and horses he really had grown up if you can find it in your heart to forgive me or at least to put the past behind you i would love to see you and meet your husband the mention of a husband was a tactful way of saying he had no romantic intentions daisy guessed i will be in london on leave next weekend may i take the two of you to dinner do say yes with affectionate good wishes charles hb farquharson boy was not at home that weekend but daisy accepted for herself she was starved of male companionship like many women in wartime london lloyd had gone to spain and disappeared he said he was going to be a military attaché at the british embassy in madrid daisy wished it might be true that he had such a safe job but she did not believe it when she asked why the government would send an ablebodied young officer to do a desk job in a neutral country he had explained how important it was to discourage spain from joining in the war on the fascist side but he said it with a rueful smile that told her plainly she was not to be fooled she feared that in reality he was slipping across the border to work with the french resistance and she had nightmares about him being captured and tortured she had not seen him for more than a year his absence was like an amputation she felt it every hour of the day but she was glad of the chance to spend an evening out with a man even if it was the awkward unglamorous overweight charlie farquharson charlie booked a table in the grill room of the savoy hotel in the lobby of the hotel as a waiter was helping her take off her mink coat she was approached by a tall man in a wellcut dinner jacket who looked vaguely familiar he stuck out his hand and said shyly hello daisy what a pleasure to see you after all these years when she heard his voice she realized it was charlie good lord she said youve changed i lost a little weight he admitted you sure did forty or fifty pounds she guessed it made him betterlooking his features now seemed craggy rather than ugly but you havent changed at all he said looking her up and down she had made an effort with her clothes she had bought nothing new for years because of wartime austerity but for tonight she had exhumed an offtheshoulder sapphireblue silk evening gown by lanvin that she had acquired on her last prewar trip to paris in a couple of months ill be twentysix she said i cant believe i look the same as i did when i was eighteen he glanced down at her décolletage blushed and said believe me you do they went into the restaurant and sat down i was afraid you werent coming he said my watch stopped im sorry im late only by twenty minutes i would have waited an hour a waiter asked if they would like a drink daisy said this is one of the few places in england where you can get a decent martini two of those please charlie said i like mine straight up with an olive so do i she studied him intrigued by the way he had altered his old awkwardness had softened to a charming shyness it was still hard to imagine him as a fighter pilot shooting down german planes anyway the blitz on london had come to an end half a year ago and there were no longer air battles in the skies over southern england what kind of flying do you do she said mainly daytime circus operations over northern france whats a circus operation a bomber attack with a heavy escort of fighters the main object being to lure enemy planes into an air battle in which theyre outnumbered i hate bombers she said i lived through the blitz he was surprised i would have thought youd want to give the germans a taste of their own medicine not at all daisy had thought about this a lot i could weep for all the innocent women and children who were burned and maimed in london and it doesnt help at all to know that german women and children are suffering the same i never looked at it that way they ordered dinner wartime regulations restricted them to three courses and their meal could not cost more than five shillings on the menu were special austerity dishes such as mock duck made out of pork sausages and woolton pie which contained no meat at all charlie said i cant tell you how good it is to hear a girl speak real american i like english girls and ive even dated one but i miss american voices me too she said this is my home now and i dont guess ill ever go back but i know how you feel im sorry i missed meeting viscount aberowen hes in the air force like you hes a pilot trainer he gets home now and again but not this weekend daisy was sleeping with boy again on his occasional visits home she had sworn she never would after catching him with those awful women in aldgate but he had put pressure on her he said that fighting men needed consolation when they came home and he had promised never to visit prostitutes again she did not really believe his promises but all the same she gave in albeit against her inclination after all she told herself i did marry him for better or worse however she no longer took any pleasure in sex with him unfortunately she could go to bed with boy but she could not fall back in love with him she had to use cream for lubrication she had tried to summon again the fond feelings she had once had for him when she had found him an exciting young aristocrat with the world at his feet full of fun and capable of enjoying life thoroughly but he was not really exciting she now realized he was just a selfish and rather limited man with a title when he was on top of her all she could think about was that he might be passing her some disgusting infection charlie said carefully im sure you dont want to talk too much about the rouzrokh family no but did you hear that joanne died no daisy was shocked how at pearl harbor she was engaged to woody dewar and she went with him to visit his brother chuck who is stationed there they were in a car that was strafed by a zero thats a jap fighter plane and she was hit im so sorry poor joanne poor woody their food came and a bottle of wine they ate in silence for a while daisy discovered that mock duck did not taste much like duck charlie said joanne was one of two thousand four hundred people killed at pearl harbor we lost eight battleships and ten other vessels goddamn sneaky japs people here are secretly pleased because the us is in the fight now god alone knows why hitler was dumb enough to declare war on the states but the british think they have a chance of winning at last with the russians and us on their side americans are very angry about pearl harbor people here dont see why the japanese kept on negotiating right up until the last minute long after they must have made the decision thats deceitful daisy frowned it seems sensible to me if agreement had been reached at the last minute they could have called off the attack but they didnt declare war would that have made any difference we were expecting them to attack the philippines pearl harbor would have taken us by surprise even after a declaration of war charlie spread his hands in a gesture of bafflement why did they have to attack us anyway we stole their money froze their assets they cant see the difference and we cut off their oil we had them up against the wall they were facing ruin what were they to do they should have given in and agreed to withdraw from china yes they should but if it was america that was being pushed around and told what to do by some other country would you want us to give in maybe not he grinned i said you hadnt changed id like to take that back why you never used to talk like this in the old days you wouldnt discuss politics at all if you dont take an interest then what happens is your fault i guess weve all learned that they ordered dessert daisy said whats going to happen to the world charlie all europe is fascist the germans have conquered much of russia the usa is an eagle with a broken wing sometimes im glad i dont have children dont underestimate the usa were wounded not crushed japan is cock of the walk now but the day will come when the japanese people shed bitter tears of regret for pearl harbor i hope youre right and the germans arent having things all their own way any longer they failed to take moscow and theyre on the retreat do you realize the battle of moscow was hitlers first real defeat is it a defeat or just a setback either way its the worst military result hes ever had the bolsheviks gave the nazis a bloody nose charlie had discovered vintage port a british taste in london men drank it after the ladies had retired from the dinner table a tiresome practice that daisy had tried to abolish in her own house without success they had a glass each on top of the martini and the wine it made daisy feel a little drunk and happy they reminisced about their adolescence in buffalo and laughed about the foolish things they and others had done you told us all you were going to london to dance with the king charlie said and you did i hope they were jealous and how dot renshaw went into spasm daisy laughed happily im glad we got back in contact charlie said i like you so much im glad too they left the restaurant and got their coats the doorman summoned a taxi ill take you home charlie said as they drove along the strand he put his arm around her she was about to protest then she thought what the hell she snuggled up to him what a fool i am he said i wish id married you when i had the chance you would have made a better husband than boy fitzherbert she said but then she would never have met lloyd she realized she had not said anything to charlie about lloyd as they turned into her street charlie kissed her it felt nice to be wrapped in a mans arms and kissing his lips but she knew it was the booze making her feel that way and in truth the only man she wanted to kiss was lloyd all the same she did not push him away until the cab came to a halt how about a nightcap he said for a moment she was tempted it was a long time since she had touched a mans hard body but she did not really want charlie no she said im sorry charlie but i love someone else we dont have to go to bed together he whispered but if we could just you know smooch a while she opened the door and stepped out she felt like a heel he was risking his life for her every day and she would not even give him a cheap thrill goodnight charlie and good luck she said before she could change her mind she slammed the car door and went into her house she went straight upstairs a few minutes later alone in bed she felt wretched she had betrayed two men lloyd because she had kissed charlie and charlie because she had sent him away dissatisfied she spent most of sunday in bed with a hangover on monday evening she got a phone call im hank bartlett said a young american voice friend of charlie farquharson at duxford he talked to me about you and i found your number in his book her heart stopped why are you calling me bad news im afraid he said charlie died today shot down over abbeville no it was his first mission in his new spitfire he talked about that she said dazedly i thought you might like to know thank you yes she whispered he just thought you were the bees knees did he you should have heard him go on about how great you are im sorry she said im so sorry then she could no longer speak and she hung up the phone ii chuck dewar looked over the shoulder of lieutenant bob strong one of the cryptanalysts some of them were chaotic but strong was the tidy kind and he had nothing on his desk but a single sheet of paper on which he had written yolokutawana i cant get it strong said in frustration if the decrypt is right it says they have struck yolokutawana but it doesnt mean anything theres no such word chuck stared at the six japanese syllables he felt sure they ought to mean something to him even though he knew only a smattering of the language but he could not figure it out and he got on with his work the atmosphere in the old administration building was grim for weeks after the raid chuck and eddie saw bloated bodies from sunk ships floating on the oily surface of pearl harbor at the same time the intelligence they were handling reported more devastating attacks by the japanese only three days after pearl harbor japanese planes hit the american base at luzon in the philippines and destroyed the pacific fleets entire stock of torpedoes the same day in the south china sea they sank two british battleships the repulse and the prince of wales leaving the british helpless in the far east they seemed unstoppable bad news just kept coming in the first few months of the new year japan defeated us forces in the philippines and beat the british in hong kong singapore and rangoon the capital of burma many of the place names were unfamiliar even to seamen such as chuck and eddie to the american public they sounded like distant planets in a sciencefiction yarn guam wake bataan but everyone knew the meaning of retreat submit and surrender chuck felt bewildered could japan really beat america he could hardly believe it by may the japanese had what they wanted an empire that gave them rubber tin and most important of all oil information leaking out indicated that they were ruling their empire with a brutality that would have made stalin blush but there was a fly in their ointment and it was the us navy the thought made chuck proud the japanese had hoped to destroy pearl harbor completely and gain control of the pacific ocean but they had failed american aircraft carriers and heavy cruisers were still afloat intelligence suggested the japanese commanders were infuriated that the americans refused to lie down and die after their losses at pearl harbor the americans were outnumbered and outgunned but they did not flee and hide instead they launched hitandrun raids on japanese ships doing minor damage but boosting american morale and giving the japanese the unshakable feeling that they had not yet won then on april planes launched from a carrier bombed the centre of tokyo inflicting a terrible wound on the pride of the japanese military the celebrations in hawaii were ecstatic chuck and eddie got drunk that night but there was a showdown coming every man chuck spoke to in the old administration building said the japanese would launch a major attack early in the summer to tempt american ships to come out in force for a final battle the japanese hoped the superior strength of their navy would be decisive and the american pacific fleet would be wiped out the only way the americans could win was to be better prepared and have better intelligence to move faster and be smarter during those months station hypo worked day and night to crack jnb the new code of the imperial japanese navy by may they had made progress the us navy had wireless intercept stations all around the pacific rim from seattle to australia there men known as the on the roof gang sat with headsets and radio receivers listening to japanese radio traffic they scanned the airwaves and wrote what they heard on message pads the signals were in morse code but the dots and dashes of naval signals translated into fivedigit number groups each representing a letter word or phrase in a code book the apparently random numbers were relayed by secure cable to teleprinters in the basement of the old administration building then the difficult part began cracking the code they always started with small things the last word of any signal was often owari meaning end the cryptanalyst would look for other appearances of that number group in the same signal and write end above any he found the japanese helped them by making an uncharacteristically careless mistake delivery of the new code books for jnb was delayed to some farflung units so for a fatal few weeks the japanese high command sent out some messages in both codes since the americans had broken much of the original jn they were able to translate the message in the old code set the decrypt alongside the message in the new code and figure out the meanings of the fivedigit groups of the new code for a while they progressed by leaps and bounds the original eight cryptanalysts were supplemented after pearl harbor by some of the musicians from the band of the sunk battleship california for reasons no one understood musicians were good at decoding every signal was kept and every decrypt filed comparison of one with another was crucial to the work an analyst might ask for all the signals from a particular day or all the signals to one ship or all the signals that mentioned hawaii chuck and the other clerical staff developed evermorecomplex systems of crossindexing to help them find whatever the analysts needed the unit predicted that in the first week of may the japanese would attack port moresby the allied base in papua they were right and the us navy intercepted the invasion fleet in the coral sea both sides claimed victory but the japanese did not take port moresby and admiral nimitz commanderinchief of the pacific began to trust his codebreakers the japanese did not use regular names for locations in the pacific ocean every important place had a designation consisting of two letters in fact two characters or kanas of the japanese alphabet although the codebreakers usually used equivalents from the roman a to z the men in the basement struggled to figure out the meaning of each of these twokana designators they made slow progress mo was port moresby ah was oahu but many were unknown in may evidence was fast building up of a major japanese assault at a location they called af the best guess of the unit was that af meant midway the atoll at the western end of the fifteenhundredmilelong chain of islands that started at hawaii midway was halfway between los angeles and tokyo a guess was not enough of course given the numerical superiority of the japanese navy admiral nimitz had to know day by day the men chuck was working with built up an ominous picture of the japanese order of battle new planes were delivered to aircraft carriers an occupation force was embarked the japanese were planning to hold on to whatever territory they won it looked as if this was the big one but where would the attack come the men in the basement were particularly proud of decoding a signal from the japanese fleet urging tokyo expedite delivery of fuelling hose they were pleased partly because of the specialized language but mainly because the signal proved that a longrange midocean manoeuvre was imminent but the american high command thought the attack might come at hawaii and the army feared an invasion of the west coast of the united states even the team at pearl harbor had a nagging suspicion it could be johnston island an airstrip a thousand miles south of midway they had to be one hundred per cent certain chuck had a notion how it might be done but he hesitated to say anything the cryptanalysts were so clever and he was not he had never done well in school in third grade a classmate had called him chucky the chump he had cried and that had guaranteed that the nickname would stick he still thought of himself as chucky the chump at lunchtime he and eddie got sandwiches and coffee from the commissary and sat on the dockside looking across the harbour it was returning to normal most of the oil had gone and some of the wrecks had been raised while they were eating a wounded aircraft carrier appeared around hospital point and steamed slowly into harbour trailing an oil slick that stretched all the way out to sea chuck identified the vessel as the yorktown her hull was blackened with soot and she had a huge hole in the flight deck presumably caused by a japanese bomb in the battle of the coral sea sirens and hooters sounded a congratulatory fanfare as she approached the navy yard and tugs assembled to nudge her through the open gates of no dry dock she needs three months work i hear eddie said he was based in the same building as chuck but in the naval intelligence office upstairs so he got to hear more gossip but shes putting to sea again in three days how are they going to manage that theyve started already the master shipfitter flew to meet her hes on board already with a team and look at the dry dock chuck saw that the vacant dock was already swarming with men and equipment he could not count the number of welding machines waiting at the quayside all the same eddie said theyll just be patching her up theyll repair the deck and make her seaworthy and everything else will have to wait something about the name of the ship bugged chuck he could not shake the nagging feeling what did yorktown mean the siege of yorktown was the last big battle of the war of independence did that have some significance captain vandermeier walked by get back to work you two girlieboys he said eddie said under his breath one of these days im going to punch him out after the war eddie said chuck when he returned to the basement and saw bob strong at his desk chuck realized he had solved strongs problem looking over the cryptanalysts shoulder again he saw the same sheet of paper with the same six japanese syllables yolokutawana he tactfully tried to make it sound as if strong himself had solved it but you have got it lieutenant he said strong was disconcerted do i its an english name so the japanese have spelt it out phonetically yolokutawana is an english name yes sir thats how the japanese pronounce yorktown what strong looked baffled for a dreadful moment chucky the chump wondered if he was completely wrong then strong said oh my god youre right yolokutawana yorktown with a japanese accent he laughed delightedly thank you he enthused well done chuck hesitated he had another idea should he say what was on his mind it was not his job to solve codes but america was an inch away from defeat maybe he should take a chance can i make another suggestion he said fire away its about the designator af we need definite confirmation that its midway right yup couldnt we write a message about midway that the japanese would want to rebroadcast in code then when we intercepted the broadcast we could find out how they encode the name strong looked thoughtful maybe he said we might have to send our message in clear to be sure they understood it we could do that it would have to be something not very confidential like say there is an outbreak of venereal disease on midway please send medicine or something like that but why would the japs rebroadcast that okay so it has to be something of military significance but not top secret something like the weather even weather forecasts are secret nowadays the cryptanalyst at the next desk put in how about a water shortage if theyre planning to occupy the place that would be important information hell this could work strong was getting excited suppose midway sends a message in clear to hawaii saying their desalination plant has broken down chuck said and hawaii replies saying were sending a water barge the japanese would be sure to rebroadcast that if theyre planning to attack midway they would need to make plans to ship fresh water there and they would broadcast in code to avoid alerting us to their interest in midway strong stood up come with me he said to chuck lets put this to the boss see what he thinks of the idea the signals were exchanged that day next day a japanese radio signal reported a water shortage at af the target was midway admiral nimitz commenced to set a trap iii that evening while more than a thousand workmen swarmed over the crippled aircraft carrier yorktown repairing the damage under arc lights chuck and eddie went to the band round the hat a bar down a dark alley in honolulu it was packed as always with sailors and locals almost all the customers were men though there were a few nurses in pairs chuck and eddie liked the place because the other men were their kind the lesbians liked it because the men did not hit on them there was nothing overt of course you could be thrown out of the navy and put in jail for homosexual acts all the same the place was congenial the bandleader wore makeup the hawaiian singer was in drag although he was so convincing that some people did not realize he was a man the owner was as queer as a threedollar bill men could dance together and no one would call you a wimp for ordering vermouth since the death of joanne chuck felt he loved eddie even more of course he had always known that eddie could be killed in theory but the danger had never seemed real now after the attack on pearl harbor chuck never passed a day without visualizing that beautiful girl lying on the ground covered in blood and his brother sobbing his heart out beside her it could so easily have been chuck kneeling next to eddie and feeling the same unbearable grief chuck and eddie had cheated death on december but they were at war now and life was cheap every day together was precious because it might be the last chuck was leaning on the bar with a beer in his hand and eddie was sitting on a high stool they were laughing at a navy pilot called trevor paxman known as trixie who was talking about the time he tried to have sex with a girl i was horrified trixie said i thought it would be all tidy down there and kind of sweet like girls in paintings but she had more hair than me they roared with laughter she was like a gorilla at that point chuck saw out of the corner of his eye the stocky figure of captain vandermeier entering the bar few officers went into enlisted mens bars it was not forbidden merely thoughtless and inconsiderate like wearing muddy boots in the restaurant of the ritzcarlton eddie turned his back hoping vandermeier would not see him no such luck vandermeier came right up to them and said well well all girls together are we trixie turned away and melted into the crowd vandermeier said where did he go he was already drunk enough to slur his words chuck saw eddies face darken chuck said stiffly good evening captain may i buy you a beer scotch onna rocks chuck got him a drink vandermeier took a swallow and said so i hear the action in this place is out the back is that right he looked at eddie no idea eddie said coldly aw come on said vandermeier off the record he patted eddies knee eddie stood up abruptly and pushed his stool back dont you touch me he said chuck said take it easy eddie theres no rule in the navy says i have to be pawed by this old queen vandermeier said drunkenly what did you call me eddie said if he touches me again i swear ill knock his ugly head off chuck said captain vandermeier sir i know a much better place than this would you like to go there vandermeier looked confused what chuck improvised a smaller quieter place like this but more intimate do you know what i mean sounds good the captain drained his glass chuck took vandermeiers right arm and gestured to eddie to take the left they led the drunk captain outside luckily a taxi was waiting in the gloom of the alley chuck opened the car door at that point vandermeier kissed eddie the captain threw his arms around him pressed his lips to eddies then said i love you chucks heart filled with fear there was no good ending to this now eddie punched vandermeier in the stomach hard the captain grunted and gasped eddie hit him again in the face this time chuck stepped between them before vandermeier could fall down chuck bundled him into the back seat of the taxi he leaned through the window and gave the driver a tendollar bill take him home and keep the change he said the taxi pulled away chuck looked at eddie oh boy he said now were in trouble iv but eddie parry was never charged with the crime of assaulting an officer captain vandermeier showed up at the old administration building next morning with a black eye but he made no accusation chuck figured it would ruin the mans career if he admitted he had got into a fight at the band round the hat all the same everyone was talking about his bruise bob strong said vandermeier claims he slipped on a patch of oil in his garage and hit his face on the lawn mower but i think his wife socked him have you seen her she looks like jack dempsey that day the cryptanalysts in the basement told admiral nimitz that the japanese would attack midway on june more specifically the japanese force would be miles north of the atoll at am they were almost as confident as they sounded eddie was gloomy what can we do he said when he and chuck met for lunch he worked in naval intelligence too and he knew the japanese strength as revealed by the codebreakers the japs have two hundred ships at sea practically their entire navy and how many do we have thirtyfive chuck was not so glum but their strike force is only a quarter of their strength the rest are the occupation force the diversion force and the reserves so a quarter of their strength is still more than our entire pacific fleet the actual japanese strike force has only four aircraft carriers but we have just three eddie pointed with his ham sandwich at the smokeblackened carrier in the dry dock with workmen swarming all over her and that includes the brokendown yorktown well we know theyre coming and they dont know were lying in wait i sure hope that makes as much difference as nimitz thinks yeah so do i when chuck returned to the basement he was told that he no longer worked there he had been reassigned to the yorktown its vandermeiers way of punishing me eddie said tearfully that evening he thinks youll die dont be pessimistic chuck said we might win the war a few days before the attack the japanese changed to new code books the men in the basement sighed and started again from scratch but they produced little new intelligence before the battle nimitz had to make do with what he already had and hope the japanese did not revise the whole plan at the last minute the japanese expected to take midway by surprise and overwhelm it easily they hoped the americans would then attack in full force in a bid to win the atoll back at that point the japanese reserve fleet would pounce and wipe out the entire american fleet japan would rule the pacific and the usa would ask for peace talks nimitz planned to nip the scheme in the bud by ambushing the strike force before they could take midway chuck was now part of the ambush he packed his kitbag and kissed eddie goodbye then they went together to the dockside there they ran into vandermeier there was no time to repair the watertight compartments he told them if shes holed shell go down like a lead coffin chuck put a restraining hand on eddies shoulder and said hows your eye captain vandermeiers mouth twisted in a grimace of malice good luck faggot he walked away chuck shook hands with eddie and went on board he forgot about vandermeier instantly for at long last he had his wish he was at sea and on one of the greatest ships ever made the yorktown was the lead ship of the carrier class she was longer than two football pitches and had a crew of more than two thousand she carried ninety aircraft elderly douglas devastator torpedo bombers with folding wings newer douglas dauntless dive bombers and grumman wildcat fighters to escort the bombers almost everything was below apart from the island structure which stood up thirty feet from the flight deck it contained the ships command and communications heart with the bridge the radio room just below it the chart house and the aviators ready room behind these was a huge smokestack containing three funnels in a row some of the repairmen were still aboard finishing their work when she left the dry dock and steamed out of pearl harbor chuck thrilled to the throb of her colossal engines as she put to sea when she reached deep water and began to rise and fall with the swell of the pacific ocean he felt as if he were dancing chuck was assigned to the radio room a sensible posting that made use of his experience in handling signals the carrier steamed to a rendezvous northeast of midway her welded patches creaking like new shoes the ship had a soda fountain known as the gedunk that served freshly made ice cream there on the first afternoon chuck ran into trixie paxman whom he had last seen at the band round the hat he was glad to have a friend aboard on wednesday june the day before the predicted attack a navy flying boat on reconnaissance west of midway spotted a convoy of japanese transport ships presumably carrying the occupation force that was to take over the atoll after the battle the news was broadcast to all us ships and chuck in the radio room of the yorktown was among the first to know it was hard confirmation that his comrades in the basement had been right and he felt a sense of relief that they had been vindicated that was ironic he realized he would not be in such danger if they had been wrong and the japanese were elsewhere he had been in the navy for a year and a half but until now he had never gone into battle the hastily repaired yorktown was going to be the target of japanese torpedoes and bombs she was steaming towards people who would do everything in their power to sink her and sink chuck too it was a weird feeling most of the time he was strangely calm but every now and again he felt an impulse to dive over the side and start swimming back towards hawaii that night he wrote to his parents if he died tomorrow he and the letter would probably go down with the ship but he wrote it anyway he said nothing about why he had been reassigned it crossed his mind to confess that he was queer but he quickly dismissed that idea he told them he loved them and was grateful for everything they had done for him if i die fighting for a democratic country against a cruel military dictatorship my life will not have been wasted he wrote when he read it over it sounded a bit pompous but he left it as it was it was a short night aircrew were piped to breakfast at am chuck went to wish trixie paxman good luck in recompense for the early start the airmen were eating steak and eggs their planes were brought up from the belowdecks hangars in the ships huge elevators then manoeuvred by hand to their parking slots on deck to be fuelled and armed a few pilots took off and went looking for the enemy the rest sat in the briefing room wearing their flying gear waiting for news chuck went on duty in the radio room just before six he picked up a signal from a reconnaissance flying boat many enemy planes heading midway a few minutes later he got a partial signal enemy carriers it had started when the full report came in a minute later it placed the japanese strike force almost exactly where the cryptanalysts had forecast chuck felt proud and scared the three american aircraft carriers yorktown enterprise and hornet set a course that would bring their planes within striking distance of the japanese ships on the bridge was the longnosed admiral frank fletcher a fiftysevenyearold veteran who had won the navy cross in the first world war carrying a signal to the bridge chuck heard him say we havent seen a japanese plane yet that means they still dont know were here that was all the americans had going for them chuck knew the advantage of better intelligence the japanese undoubtedly hoped to catch midway napping in a repeat of the pearl harbor scenario but it was not going to happen thanks to the cryptanalysts the american planes at midway were not sitting targets parked on their runways by the time the japanese bombers arrived they were all in the air and spoiling for a fight tensely listening to the crackling wireless traffic from midway and the japanese ships the officers and men in the radio room of the yorktown had no doubt that there was a terrific air battle going on over the tiny atoll but they did not know who was winning soon afterwards american planes from midway took the fight to the enemy and attacked the japanese aircraft carriers in both battles as far as chuck could make out the antiaircraft guns had the best of it only moderate damage was done to the base at midway and almost all the bombs and torpedoes aimed at the japanese fleet missed but in both encounters a lot of aircraft were shot down the score seemed even but that bothered chuck for the japanese had more in reserve just before seven the yorktown the enterprise and the hornet swung around to the southeast it was a course that unfortunately took them away from the enemy but their planes had to take off into the southeasterly wind every corner of the mighty yorktown trembled to the thunder of the aircraft as their engines rose to full throttle and they powered along the deck one after another and shot up into the air chuck noticed the tendency of the wildcat to lift its right wing and wander left as it accelerated along the deck a characteristic much complained of by pilots by half past eight the three carriers had sent american planes to attack the enemy strike force the first planes arrived in the target area with perfect timing when the japanese were busy refuelling and rearming their own planes returning from midway the flight decks were littered with ammunition cases scattered in a snakes nest of fuel hoses all ready to blow up in an instant there should have been carnage but it did not happen almost all the american aircraft in the first wave were destroyed the devastators were obsolete the wildcats that escorted them were better but no match for the fast manoeuvrable japanese zeroes those planes that survived to deliver their ordnance were decimated by devastating antiaircraft fire from the carriers dropping a bomb from a moving aircraft on to a moving ship or dropping a torpedo where it would hit a ship was extraordinarily difficult especially for a pilot who was under fire from above and below most of the airmen gave their lives in the attempt and not one of them scored a hit no american bomb or torpedo found its target the first three waves of attacking planes one from each american carrier did no damage at all to the japanese strike force the ammunition on their decks did not explode and their fuel lines did not catch fire they were unharmed listening to the radio chatter chuck despaired he saw with new vividness the genius of the attack on pearl harbor seven months earlier the american ships had been at anchor static targets crowded together relatively easy to hit the fighter planes that might have protected them were destroyed on their airstrips and by the time the americans had armed and deployed their antiaircraft guns the attack was almost over however this battle was still going on and not all the american planes had yet reached the target area he heard an air officer on the enterprise radio shout attack attack and the laconic response from a pilot wilco as soon as i can find the bastards the good news was that the japanese commander had not yet sent aircraft to attack the american ships he was sticking to his plan and concentrating on midway he might by now have figured out that he must be under attack from carrierborne planes but perhaps he was not sure where the american ships were located despite this advantage the americans were not winning then the picture changed a flight of thirtyseven dauntless dive bombers from the enterprise sighted the japanese the zeroes protecting the ships had come down almost to sea level in their dogfights with previous attackers so the bombers found themselves fortunately above the fighters and able to come down at them out of the sun just minutes later another eighteen dauntlesses from the yorktown reached the target area one of the pilots was trixie the radio exploded with excited chatter chuck closed his eyes and concentrated trying to make sense of the distorted sounds he could not identify trixies voice then behind the talk he began to hear the characteristic scream of bombers diving the attack had begun suddenly for the first time there were cries of triumph from the pilots got you you bastard shit i felt that go up eat that you sons of bitches bullseye look at her burn the men in the radio room cheered wildly but they were not sure what was happening it was over in a few minutes but it took a long time to get a clear report the pilots were incoherent with the joy of victory gradually as they calmed down and headed back towards their ships the picture emerged trixie paxman was among the survivors most of their bombs had missed as previously but about ten had scored direct hits and those few had done tremendous damage three mighty japanese aircraft carriers were burning out of control kaga soryu and the flagship akagi the enemy had only one left the hiryu three out of the four chuck said elatedly and they still havent come anywhere near our ships that soon changed admiral fletcher sent out ten dauntlesses to scout for the surviving japanese carrier but it was the yorktowns radar that picked up a flight of planes presumably from the hiryu fifty miles away and approaching at noon fletcher sent up twelve wildcats to meet the attackers the rest of the planes were also ordered up so they would not be on deck and vulnerable when the attack came meanwhile the yorktowns fuel lines were flooded with carbon dioxide as a fire precaution the attacking flight included fourteen vals aichi da dive bombers plus escorting zeroes here it comes chuck thought my first action he wanted to throw up he swallowed hard before the attackers could be seen the yorktowns gunners opened up the ship had four pairs of large antiaircraft guns with fiveinchdiameter barrels that could send their shells several miles plotting the enemys position with the aid of radar gunnery officers sent a salvo of giant fiftyfourpound shells towards the approaching aircraft setting the timers to explode when they reached their target the wildcats got above the attackers and according to the pilots radio reports shot down six bombers and three fighters chuck ran to the flag bridge with a signal to say the remainder of the attack force were diving in admiral fletcher said coolly well ive got my tin hat on i cant do anything else chuck looked out of the window and saw the dive bombers screaming out of the sky towards him at an angle so steep they seemed to be falling straight down he resisted the impulse to throw himself to the floor the ship made a sudden fullrudder turn to port anything that might throw the attacking aircraft off course was worth a try the yorktown deck also had four chicago pianos smaller shortrange antiaircraft guns with four barrels each now these opened up and so did the guns of yorktowns escort of cruisers as chuck stared forward from the bridge terrified and helpless to do anything to defend himself a deck gunner found his range and hit a val the plane seemed to break into three pieces two fell into the sea and one crashed into the side of the ship then another val blew up chuck cheered but that left six the yorktown made a sudden turn to starboard the vals braved the hail of death from the deck guns to chase after the ship as they got closer the machine guns on the catwalks either side of the flight deck also opened up now the yorktowns guns played a lethal symphony with deep booms from the fiveinch barrels midrange sounds from the chicago pianos and the urgent rattle of machine guns chuck saw the first bomb many japanese bombs had a delayed fuse instead of exploding on impact they went off a second or so later the idea being that they would crash through the deck and explode deep in the interior causing maximum devastation but this bomb rolled along the yorktowns deck chuck watched in mesmerized horror for a moment it looked as if it might do no harm then it went off with a boom and a flash of flame the two chicago pianos aft were destroyed in an instant small fires appeared on deck and in the towers to chucks amazement the men around him remained as cool as if they were attending a war game in a conference room admiral fletcher issued orders even as he staggered across the shuddering deck of the flag bridge moments later damage control teams were dashing across the flight deck with fire hoses and stretcher parties were picking up the wounded and carrying them down steep companionways to dressing stations below there were no major fires the carbon dioxide in the fuel lines had prevented that and there were no bombloaded planes on deck to blow up a moment later another val screamed down at the yorktown and a bomb hit the smokestack the explosion rocked the mighty ship a huge pall of oily black smoke gouted from the funnels the bomb must have damaged the engines chuck realized because the ship lost speed immediately more bombs missed their targets landing in the sea sending up geysers that splashed on to the deck where sea water mingled with the blood of the wounded the yorktown slowed to a halt when the crippled ship was dead in the water the japanese scored a third hit and a bomb crashed through the forward elevator and exploded somewhere below then suddenly it was over and the surviving vals climbed into the clear blue pacific sky im still alive chuck thought the ship was not lost firecontrol parties were at work before the japanese were out of sight down below the engineers said they could get the boilers going within an hour repair crews patched the hole in the flight deck with sixbyfour planks of douglas fir but the radio gear had been destroyed so admiral fletcher was deaf and blind with his personal staff he transferred to the cruiser astoria and he handed over tactical command to spruance on the enterprise under his breath chuck said fuck you vandermeier i survived he spoke too soon the engines throbbed back to life now under the command of captain buckmaster the yorktown began once again to cut through the pacific waves some of her planes had already taken refuge on the enterprise but others were still in the air so she turned into the wind and they began to touch down and refuel as she had no working radio chuck and his colleagues became a semaphore team to communicate with other ships using oldfashioned flags at half past two the radar of a cruiser escorting the yorktown revealed planes coming in low from the west an attack flight from the hiryu presumably the cruiser signalled the news to the carrier buckmaster sent up twelve wildcats to intercept the wildcats must have been unable to stop the attack for ten torpedo bombers appeared skimming the waves heading straight for the yorktown chuck could see the planes clearly they were nakajima bns called kates by the americans each carried a torpedo slung under its fuselage the weapon almost half the length of the entire plane the four heavy cruisers escorting the carrier shelled the sea around her throwing up a screen of foamy water but the japanese pilots were not so easily deterred and they flew straight through the spray chuck saw the first plane drop its torpedo the long bomb splashed into the water pointed at the yorktown the plane flashed past the ship so close that chuck saw the pilots face he was wearing a whiteandred headband as well as his flight helmet he shook a triumphant fist at the crew on deck then he was gone more planes roared by torpedoes were slow and ships could sometimes dodge them but the crippled yorktown was too cumbersome to zigzag there was a tremendous bang shaking the ship torpedoes were several times more powerful than regular bombs it felt to chuck as if she had been struck on the port stern another explosion followed close behind and this one actually lifted the ship throwing half the crew to the deck immediately afterwards the mighty engines faltered once again the damage parties were at work before the attacking planes were out of sight but this time the men could not cope chuck joined the teams manning the pumps and saw that the steel hull of the great ship was ripped like a tin can a niagara of sea water poured through the gash within minutes chuck could feel that the deck had tilted the yorktown was listing to port the pumps could not cope with the inward rush of water especially as the ships watertight compartments had been damaged at the battle of the coral sea and not fixed during her rush repairs how long could it be before she capsized at three oclock chuck heard the order abandon ship sailors dropped ropes over the high edge of the sloping deck on the hangar deck by jerking a few strings crewmen released thousands of life jackets from overhead stowage to fall like rain the escort vessels moved closer and launched their boats the crew of the yorktown took off their shoes and swarmed over the side for some reason they put their shoes on the deck in neat lines hundreds of pairs like some ritual sacrifice wounded men were lowered on stretchers to waiting whaleboats chuck found himself in the water swimming as fast as he could to get away from the yorktown before she turned over a wave took him by surprise and washed away his cap he was glad he was in the warm pacific the atlantic might have killed him with cold while he was waiting to be rescued he was picked up by a lifeboat which continued to retrieve men from the sea dozens of other boats were doing the same many crew climbed down from the main deck which was lower than the flight deck the yorktown somehow managed to stay afloat when all the crew were safe they were taken aboard the escorting vessels chuck stood on deck looking across the water as the sun went down behind the slowly sinking yorktown it occurred to him that during the whole day he had not seen a japanese ship the entire battle had been fought by aircraft he wondered if this was the first of a new kind of naval battle if so aircraft carriers would be the key vessels in future nothing else would count for much trixie paxman appeared beside him chuck was so pleased to see him alive that he hugged him trixie told chuck that the last flight of dauntless dive bombers from the enterprise and the yorktown had set alight the hiryu the surviving japanese carrier and destroyed her so all four japanese carriers are out of action chuck said thats right we got them all and lost only one of our own so said chuck does that mean we won yes said trixie i guess it does v after the battle of midway it was clear that the pacific war would be won by planes launched from ships both japan and the united states began crash programmes to build aircraft carriers as fast as possible during and japan produced seven of these huge costly vessels in the same period the united states produced ninety ii nursing sister carla von ulrich wheeled a cart into the supply room and closed the door behind her she had to work quickly what she was about to do would get her sent to a concentration camp if she were caught she took a selection of wound dressings from a cupboard plus a roll of bandage and a jar of antiseptic cream then she unlocked the drugs cabinet she took morphine for pain relief sulphonamide for infections and aspirin for fever she added a new hypodermic syringe still in its box she had already falsified the register over a period of weeks to look as if what she was stealing had been used legitimately she had rigged the register before taking the stuff rather than afterwards so that any spot check would reveal a surplus suggesting mere carelessness instead of a deficit which indicated theft she had done all this twice before but she felt no less frightened as she wheeled the cart out of the store she hoped she looked innocent a nurse bringing medical necessities to a patients bedside she walked into the ward to her dismay she saw dr ernst there sitting beside a bed taking a patients pulse all the doctors should have been at lunch it was now too late to change her mind trying to assume an air of confidence that was the opposite of what she felt she held her head high and walked through the ward pushing her cart dr ernst glanced up at her and smiled berthold ernst was the nurses dreamboat a talented surgeon with a warm bedside manner he was tall handsome and single he had romanced most of the attractive nurses and had slept with many of them if hospital gossip could be credited she nodded to him and went briskly past she pushed the trolley out of the ward then suddenly turned into the nurses cloakroom her outdoor coat was on a hook beneath it was a basketwork shopping bag containing an old silk scarf a cabbage and a box of sanitary towels in a brown paper bag carla removed the contents then swiftly transferred the medical supplies from the trolley to the bag she covered the supplies with the scarf a blue and gold geometric design that her mother must have bought in the twenties then she put the cabbage and the sanitary towels on top hung the bag on a hook and arranged her coat to cover it i got away with it she thought she realized she was trembling a little she took a deep breath got herself under control opened the door and saw dr ernst standing just outside had he been following her was he about to accuse her of stealing his manner was not hostile in fact he looked friendly perhaps she had got away with it she said good afternoon doctor can i help you with something he smiled how are you sister is everything going well perfectly i think guilt made her add ingratiatingly but it is you doctor who must say whether things are going well oh i have no complaints he said dismissively carla thought so what is this about is he toying with me sadistically delaying the moment when he makes his accusation she said nothing but stood waiting trying not to shake with anxiety he looked down at the cart why did you take that into the cloakroom i wanted something she said improvising desperately something from my raincoat she tried to suppress the frightened tremor in her voice a handkerchief from my pocket stop gabbling she told herself hes a doctor not a gestapo agent but he scared her all the same he looked amused as if he enjoyed her nervousness and the trolley im returning it to its place tidiness is essential youre a very good nurse fräulein von ulrich or is it frau fräulein we should talk some more the way he smiled told her this was not about stealing medical supplies he was about to ask her to go out with him she would be the envy of dozens of nurses if she said yes but she had no interest in him perhaps it was because she had loved one dashing lothario werner franck and he had turned out to be a selfcentred coward she guessed that berthold ernst was similar however she did not want to risk annoying him so she just smiled and said nothing do you like wagner he said she could see where this was going i have no time for music she said firmly i take care of my elderly mother in fact maud was fiftyone and enjoyed robust good health i have two tickets for a recital tomorrow evening theyre playing the siegfried idyll a chamber piece she said unusual most of wagners work was on a grand scale he looked pleased you know about music i see she wished she had not said it she had just encouraged him my family is musical my mother gives piano lessons then you must come im sure someone else could take care of your mother for an evening its really not possible carla said but thank you very much for the invitation she saw anger in his eyes he was not used to rejection she turned and started to push the cart away another time perhaps he called after her youre very kind she replied without slowing her pace she was afraid he would come after her but her ambiguous reply to his last question seemed to have mollified him when she looked back over her shoulder he had gone she stowed the trolley and breathed more easily she returned to her duties she checked on all the patients in her ward and wrote her reports then it was time to hand over to the evening shift she put on her raincoat and slung her bag over her arm now she had to walk out of the building with stolen property and her fear mounted again frieda franck was going at the same time and they left together frieda had no idea carla was carrying contraband they walked in june sunshine to the tram stop carla wore a coat mainly to keep her uniform clean she thought she was giving a convincing impression of normality until frieda said are you worried about something no why you seem nervous im fine to change the subject she pointed at a poster look at that the government had opened an exhibition in berlins lustgarten the park in front of the cathedral the soviet paradise was the ironic title of a show about life under communism portraying bolshevism as a jewish trick and the russians as subhuman slavs but even today the nazis did not have everything their own way and someone had gone around berlin pasting up a spoof poster that read permanent installation the nazi paradise war hunger lies gestapo how much longer there was one such poster stuck to the tram shelter and it warmed carlas heart who puts these things up she said frieda shrugged carla said whoever they are theyre brave they would be killed if caught then she remembered what was in her bag she too could be killed if caught frieda just said im sure now it was frieda who seemed a little jumpy could she be one of those who put up the posters probably not maybe her boyfriend heinrich was he was the intense moralistic type who would do that sort of thing hows heinrich said carla he wants to get married dont you frieda lowered her voice i dont want to have children this was a seditious remark young women were supposed to produce children gladly for the führer frieda nodded at the illegal poster i wouldnt like to bring a child into this paradise i guess i wouldnt either said carla maybe that was why she had turned down dr ernst a tram arrived and they got on carla perched the basket on her lap nonchalantly as if it contained nothing more sinister than cabbage she scanned the other passengers she was relieved to see no uniforms frieda said come home with me lets have a jazz night we can play werners records id love to but i cant carla said ive got a call to pay remember the rothmann family frieda looked around warily rothmann might or might not be a jewish name but no one was near enough to hear them of course he used to be our doctor hes not supposed to practise any more eva rothmann went to london before the war and married a scottish soldier but the parents cant get out of germany of course their son rudi was a violin maker quite brilliant apparently but he lost his job and now he repairs instruments and tunes pianos he came to the von ulrich house four times a year to tune the steinway grand anyway i said id go round there this evening and see them oh said frieda it was the long drawnout oh of someone who has just seen the light oh what said carla now i understand why youre clutching that basket as if it contained the holy grail carla was thunderstruck frieda had guessed her secret how did you know you said hes not supposed to practise that suggests he does carla saw that she had given dr rothmann away she should have said that he was not allowed to practise fortunately it was only to frieda that she had betrayed him she said what is he to do they come to his door and beg him to help them he cant turn sick people away its not as if he makes any money all his patients are jews and other poor folk who pay him with a few potatoes or an egg you dont have to defend him to me said frieda i think hes brave and youre heroic stealing supplies from the hospital to give to him is this the first time carla shook her head third but i feel such a fool for letting you find out youre not a fool its just that i know you too well the tram approached carlas stop wish me luck she said and she got off when she entered her house she heard hesitant notes on the piano upstairs maud had a pupil carla was glad it would cheer her mother up as well as providing a little money carla took off her raincoat then went into the kitchen and greeted ada when maud had announced that she could no longer pay adas wages ada had asked if she could stay on anyway now she had a job cleaning an office in the evening and she did housework for the von ulrich family in exchange for her room and board carla kicked off her shoes under the table and rubbed her feet together to ease their ache ada made her a cup of grain coffee maud came into the kitchen eyes sparkling a new pupil she said she showed carla a handful of banknotes and he wants a lesson every day she had left him practising scales and his novice fingering sounded in the background like a cat walking along the keyboard thats great said carla who is he a nazi of course but we need the money whats his name joachim koch hes quite young and shy if you meet him for goodness sake bite your tongue and be polite of course maud disappeared carla drank her coffee gratefully she had got used to the taste of burnt acorns as most people had she chatted idly to ada for a few minutes ada had once been plump but now she was thin few people were fat in todays germany but there was something wrong with ada the death of her handicapped son kurt had hit her hard she had a lethargic air she did her job competently but then she sat staring out of the window for hours her expression blank carla was fond of her and felt her anguish but did not know what to do to help her the sound of the piano ceased and a little later carla heard two voices in the hallway her mothers and a mans she assumed maud was seeing herr koch out and she was horrified a moment later when her mother entered the kitchen closely followed by a man in an immaculate lieutenants uniform this is my daughter maud said cheerfully carla this is lieutenant koch a new pupil koch was an attractive shylooking man in his twenties he had a fair moustache and reminded carla of pictures of her father when young carlas heart raced with fear the basket containing the stolen medical supplies was on the kitchen chair next to her would she accidentally betray herself to lieutenant koch as she had to frieda she could hardly speak iii am pleased to make your acquaintance she said maud looked at her with curiosity surprised at her nervousness all maud wanted was for carla to be nice to the new pupil in the hope that he would continue his studies she saw no harm in bringing an army officer into the kitchen she had no idea that carla had stolen medicines in her shopping basket koch made a formal bow and said the pleasure is mine and ada is our maid ada shot him a hostile look but he did not see it maids were beneath his notice he put his weight on one leg and stood lopsided trying to seem at ease but giving the opposite impression he acted younger than he looked there was an innocence about him that suggested an overprotected child all the same he was a danger changing his stance he rested his hands on the back of the chair on which carla had put her basket i see you are a nurse he said to her yes carla tried to think calmly did koch have any idea who the von ulrichs were he might be too young to know what a social democrat was the party had been illegal for nine years perhaps the infamy of the von ulrich family had faded away with the death of walter at any rate koch seemed to take them for a respectable german family who were poor simply because they had lost the man who had supported them a situation in which many wellbred women found themselves there was no reason he should look in the basket carla made herself speak pleasantly to him how are you getting on with the piano i believe i am making rapid progress he glanced at maud so my teacher tells me maud said he shows evidence of talent even at this early stage she always said that to encourage them to pay for a second lesson but it seemed to carla that she was being more charming than usual she was entitled to flirt of course she had been a widow for more than a year but she could not possibly have romantic feelings for someone half her age however i have decided not to tell my friends until i have mastered the instrument koch added then i will astonish them with my skill wont that be fun said maud please sit down lieutenant if you have a few minutes to spare she pointed to the chair on which carlas basket stood carla reached out to grab the basket but koch beat her to it he picked it up saying allow me he glanced inside seeing the cabbage he said your supper i presume carla said yes her voice came out as a squeak he sat on the chair and placed the basket on the floor by his feet on the side away from carla i always fancied i might be musical now i have decided it is time to find out he crossed his legs then uncrossed them carla wondered why he was so fidgety he had nothing to fear the thought crossed her mind that his unease might be sexual he was alone with three single women what was going through his mind ada put a cup of coffee in front of him he took out cigarettes he smoked like a teenager as if he was trying it out ada gave him an ashtray maud said lieutenant koch works at the ministry of war on bendler strasse indeed that was the headquarters of the supreme staff it was just as well koch was telling no one there about learning the piano all the greatest secrets of the german military were in that building even if koch himself was ignorant some of his colleagues might remember that walter von ulrich had been an antinazi and that would be the end of his lessons with frau von ulrich it is a great privilege to work there said koch maud said my son is in russia were terribly worried about him that is natural in a mother of course koch said but please do not be pessimistic the recent russian counteroffensive has been decisively beaten back that was rubbish the propaganda machine could not conceal the fact that the russians had won the battle of moscow and pushed the german line back a hundred miles koch went on we are now in a position to resume our advance are you sure maud looked anxious carla felt the same they were both tortured by fear of what might happen to erik koch tried a superior smile believe me frau von ulrich i am certain of course i cannot reveal all that i know however i can assure you that a very aggressive new operation is being planned i am sure our troops have everything they need enough food and so on she put a hand on kochs arm all the same i worry i shouldnt say that i know but i feel i can trust you lieutenant of course i havent heard from my son for months i dont know if hes dead or alive koch reached into his pocket and took out a pencil and a small notebook i can certainly find out for you he said could you said maud wideeyed carla thought this might be her reason for flirting koch said oh yes i am on the general staff you know albeit in a humble role he tried to look modest i can inquire about erik erik von ulrich that would be wonderful hes a medical orderly he was studying to be a doctor but he was impatient to fight for the führer it was true erik had been a gungho nazi although his last few letters home had taken a more subdued tone koch wrote down the name maud said youre a wonderful man lieutenant koch it is nothing im so glad were about to counterattack on the eastern front but you mustnt tell me when the attack will begin though im desperate to know maud was fishing for information carla could not imagine why she had no use for it koch lowered his voice as if there might be a spy outside the open kitchen window it will be very soon he said he looked around at the three women carla saw that he was basking in their attention perhaps it was unusual for him to have women hanging on his words prolonging the moment he said case blue will begin very soon maud flashed her eyes at him case blue how tremendously thrilling she said in the tone a woman might use if a man offered to take her to the ritz in paris for a week he whispered the twentyeighth of june maud put her hand on her heart so soon thats marvellous news i should not have said anything maud put her hand over his im so glad you did though youve made me feel so much better he stared at her hand carla realized that he was not used to being touched by women he looked up from her hand to her eyes she smiled warmly so warmly that carla could hardly believe it was per cent faked maud withdrew her hand koch stubbed out his cigarette and stood up i must go he said thank god carla thought he bowed to her a pleasure to meet you fräulein goodbye lieutenant she replied neutrally maud saw him to the door saying same time tomorrow then when she came back into the kitchen she said what a find a foolish boy who works for the general staff carla said i dont understand why youre so excited ada said hes very handsome maud said he gave us secret information what good is it to us carla asked were not spies we know the date of the next offensive surely we can find a way to pass it to the russians i dont know how were supposed to be surrounded by spies thats just propaganda everything that goes wrong is blamed on subversion by jewishbolshevik secret agents instead of nazi bungling all the same there must be some real spies how would we get in touch with them mother looked thoughtful id speak to frieda what makes you say that intuition carla recalled the moment at the bus stop when she had wondered aloud who put up the antinazi posters and frieda had gone quiet carlas intuition agreed with her mothers but that was not the only problem even if we could do we want to betray our country maud was emphatic we have to defeat the nazis i hate the nazis more than anyone but im still german i know what you mean i dont like the idea of turning traitor even though i was born english but we arent going to get rid of the nazis unless we lose the war but suppose we could give the russians information that would ensure we lost a battle erik might die in that battle your son my brother we might be the cause of his death maud opened her mouth to answer but found she could not speak instead she began to cry carla stood up and put her arms around her after a minute maud whispered he might die anyway he might die fighting for nazism better he should be killed losing a battle than winning it carla was not sure about that she released her mother anyway i wish youd warn me before bringing someone like that into the kitchen she said she picked up her basket from the floor its a good thing lieutenant koch didnt look any further into this why what have you got in there medicines stolen from the hospital for dr rothmann maud smiled proudly through her tears thats my girl i nearly died when he picked up the basket im sorry you couldnt know but im going to get rid of the stuff right now good idea carla put her raincoat back on over her uniform and went out she walked quickly to the street where the rothmanns lived their house was not as big as the von ulrich place but it was a wellproportioned town dwelling with pleasant rooms however the windows were now boarded up and there was a crude sign on the front door that said surgery closed the rothmanns had once been prosperous dr rothmann had had a flourishing practice with many wealthy patients he had also treated poor people at cheaper prices now only the poor were left carla went around the back as the patients did she knew immediately that something was wrong the back door was open and when she stepped into the kitchen she saw a guitar with a broken neck lying on the tiled floor the room was empty but she could hear sounds from elsewhere in the house she crossed the kitchen and entered the hall there were two main rooms on the ground floor they had been the waiting room and the consulting room now the waiting room was disguised as a family sitting room and the surgery had become rudis workshop with a bench and woodworking tools and usually half a dozen mandolins violins and cellos in various states of repair all medical equipment was stashed out of sight in locked cupboards but not any more she saw when she walked in the cupboards had been opened and their contents thrown out the floor was littered with smashed glass and assorted pills powders and liquids in the debris carla saw a stethoscope and a blood pressure gauge parts of several instruments were strewn around evidently having been thrown on the floor and stamped upon carla was shocked and disgusted all that waste then she looked into the other room rudi rothmann lay in a corner he was twentytwo years old a tall man with an athletic build his eyes were closed and he was moaning in agony his mother hannelore knelt beside him once a handsome blonde hannelore was now grey and gaunt what happened said carla fearing the answer the police said hannelore they accused my husband of treating aryan patients they have taken him away rudi tried to stop them smashing the place up they have she choked up carla put down her basket and knelt beside hannelore what have they done hannelore recovered the power of speech they broke his hands she whispered carla saw it at once rudis hands were red and horribly twisted the police seemed to have broken his fingers one by one no wonder he was moaning she was sickened but she saw horror every day and she knew how to suppress her personal feelings and give practical help he needs morphine she said hannelore indicated the mess on the floor if we had any its gone carla felt a spasm of pure rage even the hospitals were short of supplies and yet the police had wasted precious drugs in an orgy of destruction i brought you morphine she took from her basket a vial of clear fluid and the new syringe swiftly she took the syringe from its box and charged it with the drug then she injected rudi the effect was almost instant the moaning stopped he opened his eyes and looked at carla you angel he said then he closed his eyes and seemed to sleep we must try to set his fingers carla said so that the bones heal straight she touched rudis left hand there was no reaction she grasped the hand and lifted it still he did not stir ive never set bones said hannelore though ive seen it done often enough same here said carla but wed better try ill do his left hand you do the right we must finish before the drug wears off god knows hell be in enough pain all right said hannelore carla paused a moment longer her mother was right they had to do anything they could to end this nazi regime even if it meant betraying their own country she was no longer in any doubt lets get it done carla said gently carefully the two women began to straighten rudis broken hands ii thomas macke went to the tannenberg bar every friday afternoon it was not much of a place on one wall was a framed photograph of the proprietor fritz in a first world war uniform twentyfive years younger and without a beer belly he claimed to have killed nine russians at the battle of tannenberg there were a few tables and chairs but the regulars all sat at the bar a menu in a leather cover was almost entirely fantasy the only dishes served were sausages with potatoes or sausages without potatoes but the place stood across the street from the kreuzberg police station so it was a cop bar that meant it was free to break all the rules gambling was open street girls gave blow jobs in the toilet and the food inspectors of the berlin city government never entered the kitchen it opened when fritz got up and closed when the last drinker went home macke had been a lowly police officer at the kreuzberg station years ago before the nazis took over and men such as he were suddenly given a break some of his former colleagues still drank at the tannenberg and he could be sure of seeing a familiar face or two he still liked to talk to old friends even though he had risen so far above them becoming an inspector and a member of the ss youve done well thomas ill give you that said bernhardt engel who had been a sergeant over macke in and was still a sergeant good luck to you son he raised to his lips the stein of beer that macke had bought him i wont argue with you macke replied though i will say superintendent kringelein is a lot worse to work for than you were i was too soft on you boys bernhardt admitted another old comrade franz edel laughed scornfully i wouldnt say soft glancing out of the window macke saw a motorcycle pull up outside driven by a young man in the lightblue belted jacket of an air force officer he looked familiar macke had seen him somewhere before he had overlong redblond hair flopping on to a patrician forehead he crossed the pavement and came into the tannenberg macke remembered the name he was werner franck spoiled son of the radio manufacturer ludi franck werner came to the bar and asked for a pack of kamel cigarettes how predictable macke thought that the playboy should smoke americanstyle cigarettes even if they were a german imitation werner paid opened the pack took out a cigarette and asked fritz for a light turning to leave cigarette in his mouth tilted at a rakish angle he caught mackes eye and after a moments thought said inspector macke the men in the bar all stared at macke to see what he would say he nodded casually how are you young werner very well sir thank you macke was pleased but surprised by the respectful tone he recalled werner as an arrogant whippersnapper with insufficient respect for authority im just back from a visit to the eastern front with general dorn werner added macke sensed the cops in the bar become alert to the conversation a man who had been to the eastern front merited respect macke could not help feeling pleased that they were all impressed that he moved in such elevated circles werner offered macke the cigarette pack and macke took one a beer werner said to fritz turning back to macke he said may i buy you a drink inspector the same thank you fritz filled two steins werner raised his glass to macke and said i want to thank you that was another surprise for what said macke his friends were all listening intently werner said a year ago you gave me a good tellingoff you didnt seem grateful at the time and for that i apologize but i thought very hard about what you said to me and eventually i realized you were right i had allowed personal emotion to cloud my judgement you set me straight ill never forget that macke was touched he had disliked werner and had spoken harshly to him but the young man had taken his words to heart and changed his ways it gave macke a warm glow to feel that he had made such a difference in a young mans life werner went on in fact i thought of you the other day general dorn was talking about catching spies and asking if we could track them down by their radio signals im afraid i couldnt tell him much you should have asked me said macke its my specialty is that so come and sit down they carried their drinks to a grubby table these men are all police officers macke said but still one should not talk publicly about such matters of course werner lowered his voice but i know i may confide in you you see some of the battlefield commanders told dorn they believe the enemy often knows our intentions in advance ah said macke i feared as much what can i tell dorn about radio signal detection the correct term is goniometry macke collected his thoughts this was an opportunity to impress an influential general albeit indirectly he needed to be clear and emphasize the importance of what he was doing without exaggerating its success he imagined general dorn saying casually to the führer theres a very good man in the gestapo name of macke only an inspector at the moment but most impressive we have an instrument that tells us the direction from which the signal is coming he began if we take three readings from widely separated locations we can draw three lines on the map where they intersect is the address of the transmitter thats fantastic macke raised a cautionary hand in theory he said in practice its more difficult the pianist thats what we call the radio operator does not usually stay in the location long enough for us to find him a careful pianist never broadcasts from the same place twice and our instrument is housed in a van with a conspicuous aerial on its roof so they can see us coming but you have had some success oh yes but perhaps you should come out in the van with us one evening then you could see the whole process for yourself and make a firsthand report to general dorn thats a good idea said werner iii moscow in june was sunny and warm at lunchtime volodya waited for zoya at a fountain in the alexander gardens behind the kremlin hundreds of people strolled by many in pairs enjoying the weather life was hard and the water in the fountain had been turned off to save power but the sky was blue the trees were in leaf and the german army was a hundred miles away volodya was full of pride every time he thought back to the battle of moscow the dreaded german army master of blitzkrieg attack had been at the gates of the city and had been thrown back russian soldiers had fought like lions to save their capital unfortunately the russian counterattack had petered out in march it had won back much territory and made muscovites feel safer but the germans had licked their wounds and were now preparing to try again and stalin was still in charge volodya spotted zoya walking through the crowd towards him she was wearing a redandwhite check dress there was a spring in her step and her paleblonde hair seemed to bounce with her stride every man stared at her volodya had dated some beautiful women but he was surprised to find himself courting zoya for years she had treated him with cool indifference and talked to him about nothing but nuclear physics then one day to his astonishment she had asked him to go to a movie it was shortly after the riot in which general bobrov had been killed her attitude to him had changed that day he was not sure he understood why somehow the shared experience had created an intimacy anyway they had gone to see georges dinky jazz band a knockabout comedy starring an english banjolele player called george formby it was a popular movie and had been running for months in moscow the plot was about as unrealistic as could be unknown to george his instrument was sending messages to german uboats it was so silly that they had both laughed their socks off since then they had been dating regularly today they were to have lunch with his father he had arranged to meet her beforehand at the fountain in order to have a few minutes alone with her zoya gave him her thousandcandlepower smile and stood on tiptoe to kiss him she was tall but he was taller he relished the kiss her lips were soft and moist on his it was over too soon volodya was not completely sure of her yet they were still walking out as the older generation termed it they kissed a lot but they had not yet gone to bed together they were not too young he was twentyseven she twentyeight all the same volodya sensed that zoya was not going to sleep with him until she was ready half of him did not believe he would ever spend a night with this dream girl she seemed too blonde too intelligent too tall too selfpossessed too sexy ever to give herself to a man surely he would never be allowed to watch her take off her clothes to gaze at her naked body to touch her all over to lie on top of her they walked through the long narrow park on one side was a busy road all along the other side the towers of the kremlin loomed over a high wall to look at it youd think our leaders in there were being held prisoner by the russian people volodya said yes zoya agreed instead of the other way round he looked behind them but no one had heard all the same it was foolhardy to talk like that no wonder my father thinks youre dangerous i used to think you were like your father i wish i was hes a hero he stormed the winter palace i dont suppose ill ever change the course of history oh i know but hes so narrowminded and conservative youre not like that volodya thought he was pretty much like his father but he was not going to argue are you free this evening she said id like to cook for you you bet she had never invited him to her place ive got a piece of steak great good beef was a treat even in volodyas privileged home and the kovalevs are out of town that was even better news like many muscovites zoya lived in someone elses apartment she had two rooms and shared the kitchen and bathroom with another scientist dr kovalev and his wife and child but the kovalevs had gone away so zoya and volodya would have the place to themselves his pulse quickened should i bring my toothbrush he said she gave him an enigmatic smile and did not answer the question they left the park and crossed the road to a restaurant many were closed but the city centre was full of offices whose workers had to eat lunch somewhere and a few cafés and bars survived grigori peshkov was at a pavement table there were better restaurants inside the kremlin but he liked to be seen in places used by ordinary russians he wanted to show that he was not above the common people just because he wore a generals uniform all the same he had chosen a table well away from the rest so that he could not be overheard he disapproved of zoya but he was not immune to her enchantment and he stood up and kissed her on both cheeks they ordered potato pancakes and beer the only alternatives were pickled herrings and vodka today i am not going to speak to you about nuclear physics general said zoya please take it as read that i still believe everything i said last time we talked about the subject i dont want to bore you thats a relief he said she laughed showing white teeth instead you can tell me how much longer we will be at war volodya shook his head in mock despair she always had to challenge his father if she had not been a beautiful young woman grigori would have had her arrested long ago the nazis are beaten but they wont admit it grigori said zoya said everyone in moscow is wondering what will happen this summer but you two probably know volodya said if i did i certainly could not tell my girlfriend no matter how crazy i am about her apart from anything else it could get her shot he thought but he did not say it the potato pancakes came and they began to eat as always zoya tucked in hungrily volodya loved the relish with which she attacked food but he did not much like the pancakes these potatoes taste suspiciously like turnips he said his father shot him a disapproving look not that im complaining volodya added hastily when they had finished zoya went to the ladies room as soon as she was out of earshot volodya said we think the german summer offensive is imminent i agree said his father are we ready of course said grigori but he looked anxious they will attack in the south they want the oilfields of the caucasus grigori shook his head they will come back to moscow its all that matters stalingrad is equally symbolic it bears the name of our leader fuck symbolism if they take moscow the war is over if they dont they havent won no matter what else they gain youre just guessing volodya said with irritation so are you on the contrary i have evidence he looked around but there was no one nearby the offensive is codenamed case blue it will start on june he had learned that much from werner francks network of spies in berlin and we found partial details in the briefcase of a german officer who crashlanded a reconnaissance plane near kharkov officers on reconnaissance do not carry battle plans in briefcases grigori said comrade stalin thinks that was a ruse to deceive us and i agree the germans want us to weaken our central front by sending forces south to deal with what will turn out to be no more than a diversion this was the problem with intelligence volodya thought with frustration even when you had the information stubborn old men would believe what they wanted he saw zoya coming back all eyes on her as she walked across the plaza what would convince you he said to his father before she arrived more evidence such as grigori thought for a moment taking the question seriously get me the battle plan volodya sighed werner franck had not yet succeeded in obtaining the document if i get it will stalin reconsider if you get it ill ask him to its a deal said volodya he was being rash he had no idea how he was going achieve this werner heinrich lili and the others already took horrendous risks yet he would have to put even more pressure on them zoya reached their table and grigori stood up they were going in three different directions so they said goodbye ill see you tonight zoya said to volodya he kissed her ill be there at seven bring your toothbrush she said he walked away a happy man iv a girl knows when her best friend has a secret she may not know what the secret is but she knows it is there like an unidentifiable piece of furniture under a dust sheet she realizes from guarded and unforthcoming answers to innocent questions that her friend is seeing someone she shouldnt she just doesnt know the name although she may guess that the forbidden lover is a married man or a darkskinned foreigner or another woman she admires that necklace and knows from her friends muted reaction that it has shameful associations though it may not be until years later that she discovers it was stolen from a senile grandmothers jewel box so carla thought when she reflected on frieda frieda had a secret and it was connected with resistance to the nazis she might be deeply criminally involved perhaps she went through her brother werners briefcase every night copied secret papers and handed the copies to a russian spy more likely it was not so dramatic she probably helped print and distribute those illegal posters and leaflets that criticized the government so carla was going to tell frieda about joachim koch however she did not immediately get a chance carla and frieda were nurses in different departments of a large hospital and had different rotas so they did not necessarily meet every day meanwhile joachim came to the house daily for lessons he made no more indiscreet revelations but maud continued to flirt with him you do realize that im almost forty years old carla heard her say one day although she was in fact fiftyone joachim was completely infatuated maud was enjoying the power she still had to fascinate an attractive young man albeit a very naive one the thought crossed carlas mind that her mother might be developing deeper feelings for this boy with a fair moustache who looked a bit like the young walter but that seemed ridiculous joachim was desperate to please her and soon brought news of her son erik was alive and well his unit is in the ukraine joachim said thats all i can tell you i wish he could get leave to come home maud said wistfully the young officer hesitated she said a mother worries so much if i could just see him even for only a day it would be such a comfort to me i might be able to arrange that maud pretended to be astonished really youre that powerful im not sure i could try thank you for even trying she kissed his hand it was a week before carla saw frieda again when she did she told her all about joachim koch she told the story as if simply retailing an interesting piece of news but she felt sure frieda would not regard it in that innocent light just imagine she said he told us the code name of the operation and the date of the attack she waited to see how frieda would respond he could be executed for that frieda said if we knew someone who could get in touch with moscow we might turn the course of the war carla went on as if still talking about the gravity of joachims crime perhaps said frieda that proved it friedas normal reaction to such a story would include expressions of surprise lively interest and further questions today she offered nothing but neutral phrases and noncommittal grunts carla went home and told her mother that her intuition had been correct next day at the hospital frieda appeared in carlas ward looking frantic i have to talk to you urgently she said carla was changing a dressing for a young woman who had been badly burned in a munitions factory explosion go to the cloakroom she said ill be there as soon as i can five minutes later she found frieda in the little room smoking by an open window what is it she said frieda put out the cigarette its about your lieutenant koch i thought so you have to find out more from him i have to what are you talking about he has access to the entire battle plan for case blue we know something about it but moscow needs the details frieda was making a bewildering set of assumptions but carla went along with it i can ask him no you have to make him bring you the battle plan im not sure thats possible hes not completely stupid dont you think frieda was not even listening then you have to photograph it she interrupted she produced from the pocket of her uniform a stainlesssteel box about the size of a pack of cigarettes but longer and narrower this is a miniature camera specially designed for photographing documents carla noticed the name minox on the side youll get eleven pictures on one film here are three films she brought out three cassettes the shape of dumbbells but small enough to fit into the little camera this is how you load the film frieda demonstrated to take a picture you look through this window if youre not sure read this manual carla had never known frieda to be so domineering i really need to think about this theres no time this is your raincoat isnt it yes but frieda stuffed the camera films and booklet into the pockets of the coat she seemed relieved they were out of her hands ive got to go she went to the door but frieda at last frieda stopped and looked directly at carla what well youre not behaving like a friend this is more important youve backed me into a corner you created this situation when you told me about joachim koch dont pretend you didnt expect me to do something with the information it was true carla had triggered this emergency herself but she had not envisaged things turning out this way what if he says no then youll probably be living under the nazis for the rest of your life frieda went out hell said carla she stood alone in the cloakroom thinking she could not even get rid of the little camera without risk it was in her raincoat and she could hardly throw it into a hospital rubbish bin she would have to leave the building with it in her pocket and try to find a place where she could dispose of it secretly but did she want to it seemed unlikely that koch naive though he was could be talked into smuggling a copy of a battle plan out of the war ministry and bringing it to show his inamorata however if anyone could persuade him maud could but carla was scared there would be no mercy for her if she were caught she would be arrested and tortured she thought of rudi rothmann moaning in the agony of broken bones she recalled her father after they released him so brutally beaten that he had died her crime would be worse than theirs her punishment correspondingly bestial she would be executed of course but not for a long time she told herself she was willing to risk that what she could not accept was the danger that she would help kill her brother he was there on the eastern front joachim had confirmed it he would be involved in case blue if carla enabled the russians to win that battle erik could die as a result she could not bear that she went back to her work she was distracted and made mistakes but fortunately the doctors did not notice and the patients could not tell when at last her shift ended she hurried away the camera was burning a hole in her pocket but she did not see a safe place to dump it she wondered where frieda had got it frieda had plenty of money and could easily have bought it though she would have had to come up with a story about why she needed such a thing more likely she could have got it from the russians before they closed their embassy a year ago the camera was still in carlas coat pocket when she arrived home there was no sound from the piano upstairs joachim was having his lesson later today her mother was sitting at the kitchen table when carla walked in maud beamed and said look whos here it was erik carla stared at him he was painfully thin but apparently uninjured his uniform was grimy and ripped but he had washed his face and hands he stood up and put his arms around her she hugged him hard careless of dirtying her spotless uniform youre safe she said there was so little flesh on him that she could feel his bones his ribs and hips and shoulders and spine through the thin material safe for the moment he said she released her hold how are you better than most you werent wearing this flimsy uniform in the russian winter i stole a coat from a dead russian she sat down at the table ada was there too erik said you were right about the nazis i mean you were right she was pleased but not sure exactly what he meant in what way they murder people you told me that father told me too and mother im sorry i didnt believe you im sorry ada that i didnt believe they killed your poor little kurt i know better now this was a big reversal carla said what changed your mind i saw them doing it in russia they round up all the important people in town because they must be communists and they get the jews too not just men but women and children and old people too frail to do anyone any harm tears were streaming down his face now our regular soldiers dont do it there are special groups they take the prisoners out of town sometimes theres a quarry or some other kind of pit or they make the younger ones dig a great hole then he choked up but carla had to hear him say it then what they do them twelve at a time six pairs sometimes the husbands and wives hold hands as they walk down the slope the mothers carry the babies the riflemen wait until the prisoners are in the right spot then they shoot erik wiped his tears with his dirty uniform sleeve bang he said there was a long silence in the kitchen ada was crying carla was aghast only maud was stonyfaced eventually erik blew his nose then took out cigarettes i was surprised to get leave and a ticket home he said carla said when do you have to go back tomorrow i have only twentyfour hours here all the same im the envy of all my comrades theyd give anything for a day at home dr weiss said i must have friends in high places you do said maud joachim koch a young lieutenant who works at the war ministry and comes to me for piano lessons i asked him to arrange leave for you she glanced at her watch hell be here in a few minutes he has grown fond of me hes in need of a mother figure i think mother hell carla thought there was nothing maternal about mauds relationship with joachim maud went on hes very innocent he told us theres going to be a new offensive on the eastern front starting on june he even mentioned the code name case blue erik said hes going to get himself shot carla said joachim is not the only one who might be shot i told someone what i learned now ive been asked to persuade joachim somehow to get me the battle plan good god erik was rocked this is serious espionage youre in more danger than i am on the eastern front dont worry i cant imagine joachim would do it carla said dont be so sure said maud they all looked at her he might do it for me she said if i asked him the right way erik said hes that naive she looked defiant hes in love with me oh erik was embarrassed at the idea of his mother being involved in a romance carla said all the same we cant do it erik said why not because if the russians win the battle you might die ill probably die anyway carla heard her own voice rise in pitch agitatedly but wed be helping the russians kill you i still want you to do it erik said fiercely he looked down at the chequered oilcloth on the kitchen table but what he was seeing was a thousand miles away carla felt torn if he wanted her to she said but why i think of those people walking down the slope into the quarry holding hands his own hands on the table grasped each other hard enough to bruise ill risk my life if we can put a stop to that i want to risk my life ill feel better about myself and my country if i do please carla if you can send the russians that battle plan still she hesitated are you sure im begging you then i will said carla v thomas macke told his men wagner richter and schneider to be on their best behaviour werner franck is only a lieutenant but he works for general dorn i want him to have the best possible impression of our team and our work no swearing no jokes no eating and no rough stuff unless its really necessary if we catch a communist spy you can give him a good kicking but if we fail i dont want you to pick on someone else just for fun normally he would turn a blind eye to that sort of thing it all helped to keep people in fear of the displeasure of the nazis but franck might be squeamish werner turned up punctually at gestapo headquarters in prinz albrecht strasse on his motorcycle they all got into the surveillance van with the revolving aerial on the roof with so much radio equipment inside it was cramped richter took the wheel and they drove around the city in the early evening the favoured time for spies to send messages to the enemy why is that i wonder said werner most spies have a regular job macke explained its part of their cover story so they go to an office or a factory in the daytime of course said werner i never thought of that macke was worried they might not pick up anything at all tonight he was terrified that he would get the blame for the reverses the german army was suffering in russia he had done his best but there were no prizes for effort in the third reich it sometimes happened that the unit picked up no signals on other occasions there would be two or three and macke would have to choose which to follow up and which to ignore he felt sure there was more than one spy network in the city and they probably did not know of each others existence he was trying to do an impossible job with inadequate tools they were near the potsdamer platz when they heard a signal macke recognized the characteristic sound thats a pianist he said with relief at least he could prove to werner that the equipment worked someone was broadcasting fivedigit numbers one after the other soviet intelligence uses a code in which pairs of numbers stand for letters macke explained to werner so for example might stand for a transmitting them in groups of five is just a convention the radio operator an electrical engineer named mann read off a set of coordinates and wagner drew a line on a map with a pencil and rule richter put the van in gear and set off again the pianist continued to broadcast his beeps sounding loud in the van macke hated the man whoever he was bastard communist swine he said one day hell be in our basement begging me to let him die so the pain will come to an end werner looked pale he was not used to police work macke thought after a moment the young man pulled himself together the way you describe the soviet code it sounds as if it might not be too difficult to break he said thoughtfully correct macke was pleased that werner caught on so fast but i was simplifying they have refinements after encoding the message as a series of numbers the pianist then writes a key word underneath it repeatedly it might be kurfürstendamm say and encodes that then he subtracts the second numbers from the first and broadcasts the result almost impossible to decipher if you dont know the key word exactly they stopped again near the burnedout reichstag building and drew another line on the map the two met in friedrichshain to the east of the city centre macke told the driver to swing northeast taking them nearer to the likely spot while giving them a third line from a different angle experience shows that its best to take three bearings macke told werner the equipment is only approximate and the extra measurement reduces error do you always catch him said werner by no means in most cases we dont often were just not quick enough he may change frequency halfway through so that we lose him sometimes he breaks off in midtransmission and resumes at another location he may have lookouts who see us coming and warn him to flee a lot of snags but we catch them sooner or later richter stopped the van and mann took the third bearing the three pencil lines on wagners map met to form a small triangle near the east station the pianist was somewhere between the railway line and the canal macke gave richter the location and added quick as you can werner was perspiring macke noticed perhaps it was rather hot in the van and the young lieutenant was not accustomed to action he was learning what life was like in the gestapo all the better macke thought richter headed south on warschauer strasse crossed the railway then turned into a cheap industrial neighbourhood of warehouses yards and small factories there was a group of soldiers toting kitbags outside a back entrance to the station no doubt embarking for the eastern front and a fellowcountryman somewhere in this neighbourhood doing his best to betray them macke thought angrily wagner pointed down a narrow street leading away from the station hes in the first few hundred yards but he could be on either side he said if we take the van any closer hell see us all right men you know the drill macke said wagner and richter take the lefthand side schneider and i will take the right they all picked up longhandled sledgehammers come with me franck there were few people on the street a man in a workers cap walking briskly towards the railway station an older woman in shabby clothes probably on her way to clean offices and they hurried quickly past not wanting to attract the attention of the gestapo mackes team entered each building one man leapfrogging his partner most businesses were closed for the day so they had to rouse a janitor if he took more than a minute to come to the door they knocked it down once inside they raced through the building checking every room the pianist was not in the first block the first building on the righthand side of the next block had a fading sign that said fashion furs it was a twostorey factory that stretched along the side street it looked disused but the front door was steel and the windows were barred a fur coat factory naturally had heavy security macke led werner down the side street looking for a way in the adjacent building was bombdamaged and derelict the rubble had been cleared from the street and there was a handpainted sign saying danger no entry the remains of a name board identified it as a furniture warehouse they stepped over a pile of stones and splintered timbers going as fast as they could but forced to tread carefully a surviving wall concealed the rear of the building macke went behind it and found a hole through to the factory next door he had a strong feeling the pianist was in here he stepped through the hole and werner followed they found themselves in an empty office there was an old steel desk with no chair and a filing cabinet opposite the calendar pinned to the wall was for probably the last year during which berliners could afford such frivolities as fur coats macke heard a footstep on the floor above he drew his gun werner was unarmed they opened the door and stepped into a corridor macke noted several open doors a staircase up and a door under the staircase that might lead to a basement macke crept along the corridor towards the foot of the stairs then noticed that werner was checking the door to the basement i thought i heard a noise from below werner said he turned the handle but the door had a flimsy lock he stepped back and raised his right foot macke said no yes i hear them werner said and he kicked the door open the crash resounded throughout the empty factory werner burst through the door and disappeared a light came on showing a stone staircase dont move werner yelled you are under arrest macke went down the stairs after him he reached the basement werner stood at the foot of the stairs looking baffled the room was empty suspended from the ceiling were rails on which coats had probably been hung an enormous roll of brown paper stood on end in one corner probably intended for wrapping but there was no radio and no spy tapping messages to moscow you fucking idiot macke said to werner he turned and ran back up the stairs werner ran after him they traversed the hallway and went up to the next floor there were rows of workbenches under a glass roof at one time the place must have been full of women working at sewing machines now there was nobody a glass door led to a fire escape but the door was locked macke looked out and saw nobody he put his gun away breathing hard he leaned on a workbench on the floor he noticed a couple of cigarette ends one with lipstick on they did not look very old they were here he said to werner pointing at the floor two of them your shout warned them and they escaped i was a fool werner said im sorry but im not used to this kind of thing macke went to the corner window along the street he saw a young man and woman walking briskly away the man was carrying a tan leather suitcase as he watched they disappeared into the railway station shit he said i dont think they were spies werner said he pointed to something on the floor and macke saw a crumpled condom used but empty werner said i think we caught them in the act i hope youre right said macke vi the day joachim koch promised to bring the battle plan carla did not go to work she probably could have done her usual morning shift and been home in time but probably was not enough there was always a risk that there might be a major fire or a road accident obliging her to work after the end of her shift to deal with an inrush of injured people so she stayed at home all day in the end maud had not had to ask joachim to bring the plan he had said he needed to cancel his lesson then unable to resist the temptation to boast he had explained that he had to carry a copy of the plan across town come for your lesson on the way maud had said and he had agreed lunch was strained carla and maud ate a thin soup made with a ham bone and dried peas carla did not ask what maud had done or promised to do to persuade koch perhaps she had told him he was making marvellous progress on the piano but could not afford to miss a lesson she might have asked whether he was so junior that he was monitored every minute such a remark would sting him for he pretended constantly to be more important than he was and it might easily provoke him into showing up just to prove her wrong however the ploy most likely to have succeeded was the one carla did not want to think about sex her mother flirted outrageously with koch and he responded with slavish devotion carla suspected that this was the irresistible temptation that had made joachim ignore the voice in his head saying dont be so damn stupid or perhaps not he might see sense he could show up this afternoon not with a carbon copy in his bag but with a gestapo squad and a set of handcuffs carla loaded a film cassette into the minox camera then put the camera and the two remaining cassettes in the top drawer of a low kitchen cupboard under some towels the cupboard stood next to the window where the light was bright she would photograph the document on the cupboard top she did not know how the exposed film would reach moscow but frieda had assured her it would and carla imagined a travelling salesman in pharmaceuticals perhaps or germanlanguage bibles who had permission to sell his wares in switzerland and could discreetly pass the film to someone from the soviet embassy in bern the afternoon was long maud went to her room to rest ada did laundry carla sat in the dining room which they rarely used nowadays and tried to read but she could not concentrate the newspaper was all lies she needed to cram for her next nursing exam but the medical terms in her textbook swam before her eyes she was reading an old copy of all quiet on the western front a german bestseller about the first world war now banned because it was too honest about the hardships of soldiers but she found herself holding the book in her hand and gazing out of the window at the june sunlight beating down on the dusty city at last he came carla heard a footstep on the path and jumped up to look out there was no gestapo squad just joachim koch in his pressed uniform and shiny boots his moviestar face as full of eager anticipation as that of a child arriving for a birthday party he had his canvas bag over his shoulder as usual had he kept his promise did that bag hold a copy of the battle plan for case blue he rang the bell carla and maud had premeditated every move from now on in accordance with their plan carla did not answer the door a few moments later she saw her mother walk across the hall wearing a purple silk dressing gown and highheeled slippers almost like a prostitute carla thought with shame and embarrassment she heard the front door open then close again from the hall there was a whisper of silk and a murmured endearment that suggested an embrace then the purple robe and the fieldgrey uniform passed the diningroom door and disappeared upstairs mauds first priority was to make sure he had the document she was to look at it say something admiring then put it down she would lead joachim to the piano then she would find some pretext carla tried not to think what for taking the young man through the double doors that led from the drawing room into the neighbouring study a smaller more intimate room with red velvet curtains and a big sagging old couch as soon as they were there maud would give the signal because it was hard to know in advance the exact choreography of their movements there were several possible signals all of which meant the same thing the simplest was that she would slam the door loud enough to be heard throughout the house alternatively she would use the bellpush beside the fireplace that sounded a ring in the kitchen part of the obsolete system for summoning servants but any other noise would do they had decided in desperation she would knock the marble bust of goethe to the floor or accidentally smash a vase carla stepped out of the dining room and stood in the hall looking up the stairs there was no sound she looked into the kitchen ada was washing the iron pot in which she had made the soup scrubbing with an energy that was undoubtedly fuelled by tension carla gave her what she hoped was an encouraging smile carla and maud would have liked to keep this whole affair secret from ada not because they did not trust her quite the contrary her hostility to the nazis was fanatical but because the knowledge made her complicit in treachery and liable to the most extreme punishment however they lived too much together for secrecy to be possible and ada knew everything carla faintly heard maud give a tinkling laugh she knew that sound it struck an artificial note and indicated that she was straining her powers of fascination to the limit did joachim have the document or not a minute or two later carla heard the piano it was undoubtedly joachim playing the tune was a simple childrens song about a cat in the snow abc die katze lief im schnee carlas father had sung it to her a hundred times she felt a lump in her throat now when she thought of that how dare the nazis play such songs when they had made orphans of so many children the song stopped abruptly in the middle something had happened carla strained to hear voices footsteps anything but there was nothing a minute went by then another something had gone wrong but what she looked through the kitchen doorway at ada who stopped scrubbing to spread her hands in a gesture that signified i have no idea carla had to find out she went quietly up the stairs treading noiselessly on the threadbare carpet she stood outside the drawing room still she could hear nothing no piano music no movement no voices she opened the door as quietly as possible she peeped in she could see no one she stepped inside and looked all around the room was empty there was no sign of joachims canvas bag she looked at the double door that led to the study one of the two doors stood half open carla tiptoed across the room there was no carpet here just polished wood blocks and her footsteps were not completely silent but she had to take the risk as she got nearer she heard whispers she reached the doorway she flattened herself against the wall then risked a look inside they were standing up embracing kissing joachim had his back to the door and to carla no doubt maud had taken care to move him into that position as carla watched maud broke the kiss looked over his shoulder and caught carlas eye she took her hand away from joachims neck and made an urgent pointing gesture carla saw the canvas bag on a chair she understood immediately what had gone wrong when maud had inveigled joachim into the study he had not obliged them by leaving his bag in the drawing room but had nervously taken it with him now carla had to retrieve it heart thudding she stepped into the room maud murmured oh yes keep doing that my sweet boy joachim groaned i love you my darling carla took two paces forward picked up the canvas bag turned around and stepped silently out of the room the bag was light she walked quickly across the drawing room and ran down the stairs breathing hard in the kitchen she put the bag on the table and unbuckled its straps inside were todays edition of the berlin newspaper der angriff a fresh pack of kamel cigarettes and a plain buffcoloured cardboard folder with trembling hands she took out the folder and opened it it contained a carbon copy of a document the first page was headed directive no on the last page was a dotted line for a signature nothing was penned there no doubt because this was a copy but the name typed beside the line was adolf hitler in between was the plan for case blue exultation rose in her heart mingled with the tension she already felt and the terrible dread of discovery she put the document on the low cupboard next to the kitchen window she jerked open the drawer and took out the minox camera and the two spare films she positioned the document carefully then began to photograph it page by page it did not take long there were just ten pages she did not even have to reload film she was done she had stolen the battle plan that was for you father she put the camera back in the drawer closed the drawer slipped the document into the cardboard folder put the folder back in the canvas bag and closed the bag fastening the straps moving as quietly as she could she carried the bag back upstairs as she crept into the drawing room she heard her mothers voice maud was speaking clearly and emphatically as if she wanted to be overheard and carla immediately sensed a warning please dont worry she was saying its because you were so excited we were both excited joachims voice came in reply low and embarrassed i feel a fool he said you only touched me and it was all over carla could guess what had happened she had no experience of it but girls talked and nurses conversations were brutally detailed joachim must have ejaculated prematurely frieda had told her that heinrich had done the same several times when they were first together and had been mortified with embarrassment though he had soon got over it it was a sign of nervousness she said the fact that maud and joachims embraces were over so early created a difficulty for carla joachim would be more alert now no longer blind and deaf to everything going on around him all the same maud must be doing her best to keep his back to the doorway if carla could just slip in for a second and replace the bag on the chair without being seen by joachim they could still get away with it heart pounding carla crossed the drawing room and paused at the open door maud said reassuringly it happens often the body becomes impatient its nothing carla put her head around the door the two of them were still standing in the same place still close together maud looked past joachim and saw carla she put her hand on joachims cheek keeping his gaze away from carla and said kiss me again and tell me you dont hate me for this little accident carla stepped inside joachim said i need a cigarette as he turned around carla stepped back outside she waited by the door did he have cigarettes in his pocket or would he look for the new pack in his bag the answer came a second later wheres my bag he said carlas heart stopped mauds voice came clearly you left it in the drawing room no i didnt carla crossed the room dropped the bag on a chair and stepped outside then she paused on the landing listening she heard them move from the study to the drawing room maud said there it is i told you so i did not leave it there he said stubbornly i vowed i would not let it out of my sight but i did when i was kissing you my darling youre upset about what happened between us try to relax someone must have come into the room while i was distracted how absurd i dont think so lets sit at the piano side by side the way you like to she said but she was beginning to sound desperate who else is in this house guessing what would happen next carla ran down the stairs and into the kitchen ada stared at her in alarm but there was no time to explain she heard joachims boots on the stairs a moment later he was in the kitchen he had the canvas bag in his hand his face was angry he looked at carla and ada one of you has been looking inside this bag he said carla spoke as calmly as she could i dont know why you should think that joachim she said maud appeared behind joachim and came past him into the kitchen lets have coffee please ada she said brightly joachim do sit down please he ignored her and scrutinized the kitchen his eye lit upon the top of the low cupboard by the window carla saw to her horror that although she had put the camera away she had left the two spare film cassettes out those are eightmillimetre film cassettes arent they joachim said have you got a miniature camera suddenly he did not seem such a little boy is that what those things are said maud ive been wondering they were left behind by another pupil a gestapo officer in fact it was a clever improvisation but joachim was not buying it and did he also leave behind his camera i wonder he said he pulled open the drawer the neat little stainlesssteel camera lay there on a white towel guilty as a bloodstain joachim looked shocked perhaps he had not really believed he was the victim of treachery but had been blustering to compensate for his sexual failure and now he was facing the truth for the first time whatever the reason he was momentarily stunned still holding the knob of the drawer he stared at the camera as if hypnotized in that short moment carla saw that a young mans dream of love had been defiled and his rage was going to be terrible at last he raised his eyes he looked at the three women around him and his gaze rested on maud you have done this he said you tricked me but you will be punished he picked up the camera and films and put them in his pocket you are under arrest frau von ulrich he took a step forward and grabbed her arm i am taking you to gestapo headquarters maud jerked her arm free of his grasp and took a step back joachim drew back his arm and punched her with all his might he was tall strong and young the blow landed on her face and knocked her down joachim stood over her you made a fool of me he screeched you lied and i believed you he was hysterical now we will both be tortured by the gestapo and we both deserve it he began to kick her where she lay she tried to roll away but came up against the cooker his right boot thudded into her ribs her thigh her belly ada rushed at him and scratched his face with her nails he batted her away with a swipe then he kicked maud in the head carla moved she knew that people recovered from all kinds of trauma to the body but a head injury often did irreparable damage however the reasoning was barely conscious she acted without forethought she picked up from the kitchen table the iron soup pot that ada had so energetically scrubbed clean holding it by its long handle she raised it high then brought it down with all her might on top of joachims head he staggered stunned she hit him again even harder he slumped to the floor unconscious maud moved out of the way of his falling body and sat upright against the wall holding her chest carla raised the pot again maud screamed no stop carla put the pot down on the kitchen table joachim moved trying to rise ada seized the pot and hit him again furiously carla tried to grab her arm but she was in a mad rage she battered the unconscious mans head again and again until she was exhausted and then she dropped the pot to the floor with a clang maud struggled to her knees and stared at joachim his eyes were wide and staring his nose was twisted sideways his skull seemed to be out of shape blood came from his ear he did not appear to be breathing carla knelt beside him put her fingertips to his neck and felt for a pulse there was none hes dead she said weve killed him oh my god maud said you poor stupid boy she was crying ada panting with effort said what do we do now carla realized they had to get rid of the body maud struggled to her feet with difficulty the left side of her face was swelling dear god it hurts she said holding her side carla guessed she had a cracked rib looking down at joachim ada said we could hide him in the attic carla said yes until the neighbours start to complain about the smell then well bury him in the back garden and what will people think when they see three women digging a hole six feet long in the yard of a berlin town house that we are prospecting for gold we could dig at night would that seem less suspicious ada scratched her head carla said we have to take the body somewhere and dump it a park or a canal but how will we carry it said ada he doesnt weigh much said maud sadly so slim and strong carla said its not the weight thats the problem ada and i can carry him but somehow we have to do it without arousing suspicion maud said i wish we had a car carla shook her head no one can get petrol anyway they were silent outside dusk was falling ada got a towel and wrapped it around joachims head to prevent his blood staining the floor maud cried silently the tears rolling down a face twisted in anguish carla wanted to sympathize but first she had to solve this problem we could put him in a box she said ada said the only box that size is a coffin how about a piece of furniture a sideboard too heavy ada looked thoughtful but the wardrobe in my room is not so weighty carla nodded a maid was assumed not to have many clothes nor to need mahogany furniture she realized with a touch of embarrassment so adas room had a narrow hanging cupboard made of flimsy deal wood lets get it she said ada had originally lived in the basement but that was now an air raid shelter and her room was upstairs carla and ada went up ada opened her cupboard and pulled all the clothes off the rail there were not many two sets of uniform a few dresses one winter coat all old she laid them neatly on the single bed carla tilted the wardrobe and took its weight then ada picked up the other end it was not heavy but it was awkward and it took them some time to manhandle it out of the door and down the stairs at last they laid it on its back in the hall carla opened the door now it looked like a coffin with a hinged lid carla went back into the kitchen and bent over the body she took the camera and films from joachims pocket and replaced them in the kitchen drawer carla took his arms ada took his legs and they lifted the body they carried it out of the kitchen into the hall and lowered it into the wardrobe ada rearranged the towel about the head though the bleeding had stopped should they take off his uniform carla wondered it would make the body harder to identify but it would give her two problems of disposal instead of one she decided against she picked up the canvas bag and dropped it into the wardrobe with the corpse she closed the wardrobe door and turned the key to make sure it did not fall open by accident she put the key in the pocket of her dress she went into the dining room and looked out through the window its getting dark she said thats good maud said what will people think that were moving a piece of furniture selling it perhaps to get money for food two women moving a wardrobe women do this sort of thing all the time now that so many men are in the army or dead its not as if we could get a removal van they cant buy petrol why would you be doing it in the halfdark carla let her frustration show i dont know mother if were asked ill have to make something up but the body cant stay here theyll know hes been murdered when they find the body theyll examine the injuries carla too was worried about that nothing we can do they may try to investigate where he went today he said he had not told anyone about his piano lessons he wanted to astonish his friends with his skill with luck no one knows he came here and without luck carla thought were all dead what will they guess to be the motive for the murder will they find traces of semen in his underwear maud looked away embarrassed yes then they will imagine a sexual encounter perhaps with another man that ended in a quarrel i hope youre right carla was not at all sure but she could not think of anything they could do about it the canal she said the body would float and be found sooner or later and there would be a murder investigation they would just have to hope it did not lead to them carla opened the front door she stood at the front of the wardrobe on its left and ada positioned herself at the back on the right they bent down ada who undoubtedly had more experience of heavy lifting than her employers said tilt it sideways and get your hands under it carla did as she said now lift your end a little carla did so ada got her hands underneath her end and said bend your knees take the weight straighten up they raised the wardrobe to hip height ada bent down and got her shoulder underneath carla did the same the two women straightened up the weight tilted to carla as they went down the steps from the front door but she could bear it when they reached the street she turned towards the canal a few blocks away it was now full dark with no moon but a few stars shedding a faint light with the blackout there was a good chance no one would see them tip the wardrobe into the water the disadvantage was that carla could hardly see where she was going she was terrified she would stumble and fall and the wardrobe would smash to splinters revealing the murdered man inside an ambulance drove by its headlights covered by slit masks it was probably hurrying to a road accident there were many during the blackout that meant there would be police cars in the vicinity carla recalled a sensational murder case from the beginning of the blackout a man had killed his wife forced her body into a packingcase and carried it across town on the seat of his bicycle in the dark before dropping it in the havel river would the police remember the case and suspect anyone transporting a large object as she thought that a police car drove by a cop stared out at the two women with their wardrobe but the car did not stop the burden seemed to get heavier it was a warm night and soon carla was running with perspiration the wood hurt her shoulder and she wished she had thought of putting a folded handkerchief inside her blouse as a cushion they turned a corner and came upon the accident an eightwheeler articulated truck carrying timber had collided headon with a mercedes saloon car which had been badly crushed the police car and the ambulance were shining their headlights on to the wreckage in a little pool of faint light a group of men gathered around the car the crash must have happened in the last few minutes for there were still people inside the car an ambulance man was leaning in at the back door probably examining the injuries to see whether the passengers could be moved carla was momentarily terrified guilt froze her and she stopped in her tracks but no one had noticed her and ada and the wardrobe and after a moment she realized she just needed to steal away double back and take a different route to the canal she began to turn but just then an alert policeman shone a flashlight her way she was tempted to drop the wardrobe and run but she held her nerve the cop said what are you up to moving a wardrobe officer she said recovering her presence of mind she faked a grisly curiosity to cover her guilty nervousness what happened here she said for good measure she added is anyone dead professionals disliked this kind of vampire inquisitiveness she knew she was a professional herself as she expected the policeman reacted dismissively none of your business he said just keep out of the way he turned back and shone his light into the crashed car the pavement on this side of the street was clear carla made a snap decision and walked straight on she and ada carried the wardrobe containing the dead man towards the wreckage she kept her eyes on the little knot of emergency workers in the small circle of light they were intensely focused on their task and no one looked up as carla passed the car it seemed to take for ever to pass along the length of the eightwheel trailer then when at last she drew level with the back end she had a flash of inspiration she stopped ada hissed what is it this way carla stepped into the road at the back of the truck put the wardrobe down she hissed no noise they placed the wardrobe gently on the pavement ada whispered are we leaving it here carla drew the key from her pocket and unlocked the wardrobe door she looked up as far as she could tell the men were still gathered around the car twenty feet away on the other side of the truck she opened the wardrobe door joachim koch stared up sightlessly his head wrapped in a bloody towel tip him out carla said by the wheels they tilted the wardrobe and the body rolled out coming to rest up against the tyres carla retrieved the bloody towel and threw it into the wardrobe she left the canvas bag lying beside the corpse she was glad to get rid of it she closed and locked the wardrobe door then they picked it up and walked away it was easy to carry now when they were fifty yards away in the dark carla heard a distant voice say my god theres another casualty looks like a pedestrian was run over carla and ada turned a corner and relief washed over carla like a tidal wave she had got rid of the corpse if only she could get home without attracting further attention and without anyone looking inside the wardrobe and seeing the bloody towel she would be safe there would be no murder investigation joachim had become a pedestrian killed in a blackout accident if he had really been dragged along the cobbled street by the wheels of the truck he might have received injuries similar to those caused by the heavy base of adas soup pot perhaps a skilled autopsy doctor could tell the difference but no one would consider an autopsy necessary carla thought about dumping the wardrobe and decided against it even without the towel it had bloodstains inside and might spark a police investigation on its own they had to take it home and scrub it clean they got home without meeting anyone else they put the wardrobe down in the hall ada took out the towel put it in the kitchen sink and ran the cold tap carla felt a mixture of elation and sadness she had stolen the nazis battle plan but she had killed a young man who was more foolish than wicked she would think about that for many days perhaps years before she could be sure how she felt about it for now she was just too tired she told her mother what they had done mauds left cheek was so puffed up that her eye was almost closed she was pressing her left side as if to ease a pain she looked terrible carla said you were terribly brave mother i admire you so much for what you did today maud said wearily i dont feel admirable im so ashamed i despise myself because you didnt love him said carla no said maud because i did iii greg peshkov graduated from harvard summa cum laude the highest honour he could have gone on effortlessly to take a doctorate in physics his major and thus have avoided military service but he did not want to be a scientist his ambition was to wield a different kind of power and after the war was over a military record would be a huge plus for a rising young politician so he joined the army on the other hand he did not want actually to have to fight he followed the european war with heightened interest at the same time as he pressured everyone he knew in washington which was a lot of people to get him a desk job at war department headquarters the german summer offensive had started on june and they had swiftly pushed east meeting relatively light opposition until they reached the city of stalingrad formerly called tsaritsyn where they were halted by fierce russian resistance now they were stalled with overstretched supply lines and it was looking more and more as if the red army had drawn them into a trap greg had not long been in basic training when he was summoned to the colonels office the army corps of engineers needs a bright young officer in washington the colonel said youve interned in washington but all the same you wouldnt have been my first choice you cant even keep your goddamn uniform clean look at you but the job requires a knowledge of physics and the field is kind of limited greg said thank you sir try that kind of sarcasm on your new boss and youll regret it youre going to be an assistant to a colonel groves i was at west point with him hes the biggest son of a bitch i ever met in the army or out good luck greg called mike penfold in the state department press office and found out that until recently leslie groves had been chief of construction for the entire us army and had been responsible for the militarys new washington headquarters the vast fivesided building they were beginning to call the pentagon but he had been moved to a new project that no one knew much about some said he had offended his superiors so often that he had been effectively demoted others that his new role was even more important but top secret they all agreed he was egotistical arrogant and ruthless does everybody hate him greg asked oh no mike said only those who have met him lieutenant greg peshkov was full of trepidation when he arrived at grovess office in the striking new war department building a paletan art deco palace on st street and virginia avenue right away he learned that he was part of a group called the manhattan engineer district this deliberately uninformative name camouflaged a team who were trying to invent a new kind of bomb using uranium as an explosive greg was intrigued he knew there was incalculable energy locked up in uraniums lighter isotope u and he had read several papers on the subject in scientific journals but news of the research had dried up a couple of years ago and now greg knew why he learned that president roosevelt felt the project was moving too slowly and groves had been appointed to crack the whip greg arrived six days after groves had been reassigned his first task for groves was to help him pin stars to the collar of his khaki shirt he had just been promoted to brigadiergeneral its mainly to impress all these civilian scientists we have to work with groves growled i have a meeting in the secretary of wars office in ten minutes youd better come with me itll serve you for a briefing groves was heavy an inch under six feet tall he had to weigh two hundred and fifty pounds maybe three hundred he wore his uniform pants high and his belly bulged under his webbing belt he had chestnutcoloured hair that might have curled if it had been grown long enough he had a narrow forehead fat cheeks and a jowly chin his small moustache was all but invisible he was an unattractive man in every way and greg was not looking forward to working for him groves and his entourage including greg left the building and walked down virginia avenue to the national mall on the way groves said to greg when they gave me this job they told me it could win the war i dont know if thats true but my plan is to act as if it is youd better do the same yes sir said greg the secretary of war had not yet moved into the unfinished pentagon and war department headquarters were still in the old munitions building a long low outofdate temporary structure on constitution avenue secretary of war henry stimson was a republican brought in by the president to keep that party from undermining the war effort by making trouble in congress at seventyfive stimson was an elder statesman a dapper old man with a white moustache but the light of intelligence still gleamed in his grey eyes the meeting was a fulldress performance and the room was full of bigwigs including army chief of staff george marshall greg felt nervous and he thought admiringly that groves was remarkably calm for someone who had been a mere colonel yesterday groves began by outlining how he intended to impose order on the hundreds of civilian scientists and dozens of physics laboratories involved in the manhattan project he made no attempt to defer to the highranking men who might well have thought they were in charge he outlined his plans without troubling to use such mollifying phrases as with your permission and if you agree greg wondered whether the man was trying to get himself fired greg learned so much new information that he wanted to take notes but no one else did and he guessed it would not look right when groves had done one of the group said i believe supplies of uranium are crucial to the project do we have enough groves answered there are tons of pitchblende thats the ore that contains uranium oxide in a yard on staten island then wed better acquire some of that said the questioner i bought it all on friday sir friday the day after you were appointed correct the secretary of war smothered a smile gregs surprise at grovess arrogance began to turn to admiration of his nerve a man in admirals uniform said what about the priority rating of this project you need to clear the decks with the war production board i saw donald nelson on saturday sir said groves nelson was the civilian head of the board i asked him to raise our rating what did he say he said no thats a problem not any longer i told him i would have to recommend to the president that the manhattan project be abandoned because the war production board was unwilling to cooperate then he gave us a triplea good said the secretary of war greg was impressed again groves was a real pistol stimson said now youll be supervised by a committee that will report to me nine members have been suggested hell no said groves the secretary of war said what did you say surely greg thought groves has gone too far this time groves said i cant report to a committee of nine mr secretary ill never get em off my back stimson grinned he was too old a hand to get offended by this kind of talk it seemed he said mildly what number would you suggest general greg could see that groves wanted to say none but what came out was three would be perfect all right said the secretary of war to gregs amazement anything else were going to need a large site something like sixty thousand acres for a uranium enrichment plant and associated facilities theres a suitable area in oak ridge tennessee its a ridge valley so that if there should be an accident the explosion will be contained an accident said the admiral is that likely groves did not hide his feeling that this was a dumb question were making an experimental bomb for christs sake he said a bomb so powerful that it promises to flatten a mediumsize city with one detonation wed be pretty goddamn dumb if we ignored the possibility of accidents the admiral looked as if he wanted to protest but stimson intervened saying carry on general land is cheap in tennessee groves said so is electricity and our plant will use huge quantities of power so youre proposing to buy this land im proposing to view it today groves looked at his watch in fact i need to leave now to catch my train to knoxville he stood up if you will excuse me gentlemen i dont want to lose any time the other men in the room were flabbergasted even stimson looked startled no one in washington dreamed of leaving a secretarys office before he indicated he was through it was a major breach of etiquette but groves seemed not to care and he got away with it very well said stimson dont let us hold you up thank you sir said groves and he left the room greg hurried out after him ii the most attractive civilian secretary in the new war office building was margaret cowdry she had big dark eyes and a wide sensual mouth when you saw her sitting behind her typewriter and she glanced up at you and smiled you felt as if you were already making love to her her father had turned baking into a massproduction industry cowdrys cookies crumble just like mas she had no need to work but she was doing her bit for the war effort before inviting her to lunch greg made sure she knew that he too was the child of a millionaire an heiress usually preferred to date a rich boy she could feel confident he was not after her money it was october and cold margaret wore a stylish navyblue coat with padded shoulders and a nippedin waist her matching beret had a military look they went to the ritzcarlton but when they got to the dining room greg saw his father having lunch with gladys angelus he did not want to make it a foursome when he explained this to margaret she said no problem well have lunch at the university womens club around the corner im a member there greg had never been there but he had a feeling he knew something about it for a moment he chased the thought around his memory but it eluded him so he put it out of his mind at the club margaret removed her coat to reveal a royalblue cashmere dress that clung to her alluringly she kept on her hat and gloves as all respectable women did when eating out as always greg loved the sensation of walking into a place with a beautiful woman on his arm in the dining room of the university womens club there were only a handful of men but they all envied him although he might not admit it to anyone else he enjoyed this as much as sleeping with women he ordered a bottle of wine margaret mixed hers with mineral water french style saying i dont want to spend the afternoon correcting my typing mistakes he told her about general groves hes a real gogetter in some ways hes a badly dressed version of my father everyone hates him margaret said greg nodded he rubs people up the wrong way is your father like that sometimes but mostly he uses charm mines the same maybe all successful men are that way the meal went quickly service in washington restaurants had speeded up the nation was at war and men had urgent work to do a waitress brought them the dessert menu greg glanced at her and was startled to recognize jacky jakes hello jacky he said hi greg she replied familiarity overlaying nervousness how have you been greg recalled the detective telling him that she worked at the university womens club that was the memory that had eluded him before im just fine he said how about you real good everything going on just the same he was wondering if his father was still paying her an allowance pretty much greg guessed that some lawyer was paying out the money and lev had forgotten all about it thats good he said jacky remembered her job can i offer you some dessert today yes thank you margaret asked for fruit salad and greg had ice cream when jacky had gone margaret said shes very pretty then looked expectant i guess he said no wedding ring greg sighed women were so perceptive youre wondering how come im friendly with a pretty black waitress who isnt married he said i might as well tell you the truth i had an affair with her when i was fifteen i hope youre not shocked of course i am she said im morally outraged she was neither serious nor joking but something in between she was not really scandalized he felt sure but perhaps she did not want to give him the impression that she was easygoing about sex not on their first lunch date anyway jacky brought the desserts and asked if they wanted coffee they did not have time the army did not believe in long lunch breaks and margaret asked for the bill guests arent allowed to pay here she explained when jacky had gone margaret said whats nice is that youre so fond of her am i greg was surprised i have fond memories i guess i wouldnt mind being fifteen again and yet shes scared of you she is not terrified i dont think so take my word men are blind but a woman sees these things greg looked hard at jacky when she brought the bill and he realized that margaret was right jacky was still scared every time she saw greg she was reminded of joe brekhunov and his straight razor it made greg angry the girl had a right to live in peace he was going to have to do something about this margaret who was as sharp as a tack said i think you know why shes scared my father frightened her off he was worried i might marry her is your father scary he does like to get his own way my fathers the same she said sweet as cherry pie until you cross him then he turns mean im so glad you understand they returned to work greg felt angry all afternoon somehow his fathers curse still lay like a blight over jackys life but what could he do what would his father do that was a good way to look at it lev would be completely singleminded about getting his way and would not care who he hurt in the process general groves would be similar i can be like that greg thought im my fathers son the beginning of a plan began to form in his mind he spent the afternoon reading and summarizing an interim report from the university of chicago metallurgical laboratory the scientists there included leo szilard the man who first conceived of the nuclear chain reaction szilard was a hungarian jew who had studied at the university of berlin until the fatal year of the research team in chicago was led by enrico fermi the italian physicist fermi whose wife was jewish had left italy when mussolini published his manifesto of race greg wondered whether the fascists realized that their racism had brought such a windfall of brilliant scientists to their enemies he understood the physics perfectly well the theory of fermi and szilard was that when a neutron struck a uranium atom the collision could produce two neutrons those two neutrons could then collide with further uranium atoms to make four then eight and so on szilard had called this a chain reaction a brilliant insight that way a ton of uranium could produce as much energy as three million tons of coal in theory in practice it had never been done fermi and his team were building a pile of uranium at stagg field a disused football stadium belonging to the university of chicago to prevent the stuff exploding spontaneously they buried the uranium in graphite which absorbed the neutrons and killed the chain reaction their aim was to bring the radioactivity up very gradually to the level at which more was being created than absorbed which would prove that a chain reaction was a reality then close it down fast before it blew up the pile the stadium the campus of the university and quite possibly the city of chicago so far they had not succeeded greg wrote a favourable précis of the report asked margaret cowdry to type it right away then took it in to groves the general read the first paragraph and said will it work well sir youre the goddamn scientist will it work yes sir it will work greg said good said groves and threw the summary in his wastepaper bin greg returned to his desk and sat for a while staring at the representation of the periodic table of the elements on the wall opposite his desk he was pretty sure the nuclear pile would work he was more worried about how to force his father to withdraw the threat to jacky earlier he had thought about handling the problem as lev would have done now he began to think about practical details he needed to take a dramatic stand his plan began to take shape but did he have the guts to confront his father at five he left for the day on the way home he stopped at a barbershop and bought a straight razor the folding kind where the blade slid into the handle the barber said youll find it better than a safety razor with your beard greg was not going to shave with it his home was his fathers permanent suite at the ritzcarlton when greg arrived lev and gladys were having cocktails he remembered meeting gladys for the first time in this room seven years ago sitting on the same yellow silk couch she was an even bigger star now lev had put her in a series of shamelessly gungho war movies in which she defied sneering nazis outwitted sadistic japanese and nursed squarejawed american pilots back to health she was not quite as beautiful as she had been at twenty greg observed the skin of her face did not have the same perfect smoothness her hair did not seem so luxuriant and she was wearing a brassiere which she would undoubtedly have scorned before but she still had darkblue eyes that seemed to issue an irresistible invitation greg accepted a martini and sat down was he really going to defy his father he had not done it in the seven years since he had first shaken gladyss hand perhaps it was time ill do it just the way he would greg thought he sipped his drink and set it down on a side table with spidery legs speaking conversationally he said to gladys when i was fifteen my father introduced me to an actress called jacky jakes levs eyes widened i dont think i know her said gladys greg took the razor from his pocket but did not open it he held it in his hand as if feeling its weight i fell in love with her lev said why are you dragging this ancient history up now gladys sensed the tension and looked anxious greg went on father was afraid i might want to marry her lev laughed mockingly that cheap tart was she a cheap tart greg said i thought she was an actress he looked at gladys gladys flushed at the implied insult greg said father paid her a visit and took with him a colleague joe brekhunov have you met him gladys i dont believe so lucky you joe has a razor like this greg snapped the razor open showing the gleaming sharp blade gladys gasped lev said i dont know what game you think youre playing just a minute greg said gladys wants to hear the rest of the story he smiled at her she looked terrified he said my father told jacky that if she ever saw me again joe would cut her face with his razor he jerked the knife just a little and gladys gave a small scream the hell with this lev said and took a step towards greg greg raised the hand holding the razor lev stopped greg did not know whether he would be able to cut his father but lev did not know either jacky lives right here in washington greg said his father said crudely are you fucking her again no im not fucking anyone though i have plans for margaret cowdry the cookie heiress why do you want joe to threaten her too dont be stupid jacky is a waitress now she never got the movie part she was hoping for i run into her on the street sometimes today she served me in a restaurant every time she sees my face she thinks joe is going to come after her shes out of her mind lev said id forgotten all about her until five minutes ago can i tell her that greg said i think by now shes entitled to her peace of mind tell her whatever the hell you like for me she doesnt exist thats great said greg shell be pleased to hear it now put that damn blade away one more thing a warning lev looked angry youre warning me if anything bad happens to jacky anything at all greg moved the razor side to side just a little lev said scornfully dont tell me youre going to cut joe brekhunov no lev showed a hint of fear youd cut me greg shook his head angrily lev said what then for christs sake greg looked at gladys she took a second to catch his drift then she jerked back in her silkupholstered chair put both hands on her cheeks as if to protect them and gave another little scream louder this time lev said to greg you little asshole greg folded the razor and stood up its how you would have handled it father he said then he went out he slammed the door and leaned against the wall breathing as hard as if he had been running he had never felt so scared in his life yet he also felt triumphant he had stood up to the old man used his own tactics back on him even scared him a little he walked to the elevator pocketing the razor his breathing eased he looked back along the hotel corridor half expecting his father to come running after him but the door of the suite remained closed and greg boarded the elevator and went down to the lobby he entered the hotel bar and ordered a dry martini iii on sunday greg decided to visit jacky he wanted to tell her the good news he remembered the address the only piece of information he had ever paid a private detective for unless she had moved she lived just the other side of union station he had promised her he would not go there but now he could explain to her that such caution was no longer necessary he went by cab crossing town he told himself he would be glad to draw a line at last under his affair with jacky he had a soft spot for his first lover but he did not want to be involved in her life in any way it would be a relief to get her off his conscience then next time he ran into her she would not look scared to death they could say hello chat for a while and walk on the cab took him to a poor neighbourhood of onestorey homes with low chainlink fences around small yards he wondered how jacky lived these days what did she do during those evenings she was so keen to have to herself no doubt she saw movies with her girlfriends did she go to washington redskins football games or follow the nats baseball team when he had asked her about boyfriends she had been enigmatic perhaps she was married and could not afford a ring by his calculation she was twentyfour if she was looking for mr right she should have found him by now but she had never mentioned a husband nor had the detective he paid off the taxi outside a small neat house with flower pots in a concrete front yard more domesticated than he had expected as soon as he opened the gate he heard a dog bark that made sense a woman living alone might feel safer with a dog he stepped on to the porch and rang the doorbell the barking got louder it sounded like a big dog but that could be deceptive greg knew no one came to the door when the dog paused for breath greg heard the distinctive silence of an empty house there was a wooden bench on the stoop he sat and waited a few minutes no one came and no helpful neighbour appeared to tell him whether jacky was away for a few minutes all day or two weeks he walked a few blocks bought the sunday edition of the washington post and returned to the bench to read it the dog continued to bark intermittently knowing he was still there it was the first of november and he was glad he had worn his olivegreen uniform greatcoat and cap the weather was wintry midterm elections would be held on tuesday and the post was predicting that the democrats would take a beating because of pearl harbor that incident had transformed america and it came as a surprise to greg to realize that it had happened less than a year ago now american men of his own age were dying on an island no one had ever heard of called guadalcanal he heard the gate click and looked up at first jacky did not notice him and he had a moment to study her she looked dowdily respectable in a dark coat and a plain felt hat and she carried a book with a black cover if he had not known her better greg would have thought she was coming home from church with her was a little boy he wore a tweed coat and a cap and he was holding her hand the boy saw greg first and said look mommy theres a soldier jacky looked at greg and her hand flew to her mouth greg stood up as they mounted the steps to the stoop a child she had kept that secret it explained why she needed to be home in the evenings he had never thought of it i told you never to come here she said as she put the key in the lock i wanted to tell you that you need not be afraid of my father any more i didnt know you had a son she and the boy stepped into the house greg stood expectantly at the door a german shepherd growled at him then looked up at jacky for guidance jacky glared at greg evidently thinking about slamming the door in his face but after a moment she gave an exasperated sigh and turned away leaving it open greg walked in and offered his left fist to the dog it sniffed warily and gave him provisional approval he followed jacky into a small kitchen its all saints day greg said he was not religious but at his boarding school he had been forced to learn all the christian festivals is that why you went to church we go every sunday she replied this is a day of surprises greg murmured she took off the boys coat sat him at the table and gave him a cup of orange juice greg sat opposite and said whats your name georgy he said it quietly but with confidence he was not shy greg studied him he was as pretty as his mother with the same bowshaped mouth but his skin was lighter than hers more like coffee with cream and he had green eyes unusual in a negro face he reminded greg a little of his halfsister daisy meanwhile georgy looked at greg with an intense gaze that was almost intimidating greg said how old are you georgy he looked at his mother for help she gave greg a strange look and said hes six six said greg youre quite a big boy arent you why a bizarre thought crossed his mind and he fell silent georgy had been born six years ago greg and jacky had been lovers seven years ago his heart seemed to falter he stared at jacky surely not he said she nodded he was born in said greg may she said eight and a half months after i left that apartment in buffalo does my father know heck no that would have given him even more power over me her hostility had vanished and now she just looked vulnerable in her eyes he saw a plea though he was not sure what she was pleading for he looked at georgy with new eyes the light skin the green eyes the odd resemblance to daisy are you mine he thought can it be true but he knew it was his heart filled with a strange emotion suddenly georgy seemed terribly vulnerable a helpless infant in a cruel world and greg needed to take care of him make sure he came to no harm he had an impulse to take the boy in his arms but he realized that might scare him so he held back georgy put down his orange juice he got off his chair and came around the table to stand close to greg with a remarkably direct look he said who are you trust a kid to ask the toughest question of all greg thought what the hell was he going to say the truth was too much for a sixyearold to take im just a former friend of your mothers he thought i was just passing the door thought id say hello nobody special may see you again most likely not he looked at jacky and saw that pleading expression intensified he realized what was on her mind she was desperately afraid he was going to reject georgy i tell you what greg said and he lifted georgy on to his knees why dont you call me uncle greg iv greg stood shivering in the spectators gallery of an unheated squash court here under the west stand of the disused stadium on the edge of the university of chicago campus fermi and szilard had built their atomic pile greg was impressed and scared the pile was a cube of grey bricks reaching the ceiling of the court standing just shy of the end wall which still bore the polkadot marks of hundreds of squash balls the pile had cost a million dollars and it could blow up the entire city graphite was the material of which pencil leads were made and it gave off a filthy dust that covered the floor and walls everyone who had been in the room a while was as blackfaced as a coal miner no one had a clean lab coat graphite was not the explosive material on the contrary it was there to suppress radioactivity but some of the bricks in the stack were drilled with narrow holes stuffed with uranium oxide and this was the material that radiated the neutrons running through the pile were ten channels for control rods these were thirteenfoot strips of cadmium a metal that absorbed neutrons even more hungrily than graphite right now the rods were keeping everything calm when they were withdrawn from the pile the fun would start the uranium was already throwing off its deadly radiation but the graphite and the cadmium were soaking it up radiation was measured by counters that clicked menacingly and a cylindrical pen recorder that was mercifully silent the array of controls and meters near greg in the gallery gave off the only heat in the place greg visited on wednesday december a bitterly cold windy day in chicago today for the first time the pile was supposed to go critical greg was there to observe the experiment on behalf of his boss general groves he hinted jovially to anyone who asked that groves feared an explosion and had deputed greg to take the risk for him in fact greg had a more sinister mission he was making an initial assessment of the scientists with a view to deciding who might be a security risk security on the manhattan project was a nightmare the top scientists were foreigners most of the rest were leftwingers either communists themselves or liberals who had communist friends if everyone suspicious was fired there would be hardly any scientists left so greg was trying to figure out which ones were the worst risks enrico fermi was about forty a small balding man with a long nose he smiled engagingly while supervising this terrifying experiment he was smartly dressed in a suit with a waistcoat it was midmorning when he ordered the trial to begin he instructed a technician to withdraw all but one of the control rods from the pile greg said what all at once it seemed frighteningly precipitate the scientist standing next to him barney mchugh said we took it this far last night it worked fine im glad to hear it said greg mchugh bearded and podgy was low down on gregs list of suspects he was american with no interest in politics the only black mark against him was a foreign wife she was british never a good sign but not in itself evidence of treachery greg had assumed there would be some sophisticated mechanism for moving the rods in and out but it was simpler than that the technician just put a ladder up against the pile climbed halfway up it and pulled out the rods by hand speaking conversationally mchugh said we were originally going to do this in the argonne forest wheres that twenty miles southwest of chicago pretty isolated fewer casualties greg shivered so why did you change your minds and decide to do it right here on fiftyseventh street the builders we hired went on strike so we had to build the damn thing ourselves and we couldnt be that far away from the laboratories so you took the risk of killing everyone in chicago we dont think that will happen greg had not thought so either but he did not feel so sure now standing a few feet away from the pile fermi was checking his monitors against a forecast he had prepared of radiation levels at every stage of the experiment apparently the initial stage went according to plan for he now ordered the last rod to be pulled halfway out there were some safety measures a weighted rod hung poised to be dropped into the pile automatically if the radiation rose too high in case that did not work a similar rod was tied to the gallery railing with a rope and a young physicist looking as if he felt a bit silly stood holding an axe ready to cut the rope in an emergency finally three more scientists called the suicide squad were positioned near the ceiling standing on the platform of the elevator used during construction holding large jugs of cadmium sulphate solution which they would throw on to the pile as if dousing a bonfire greg knew that neutron generation multiplied in thousandths of a second however fermi argued that some neutrons took longer perhaps several seconds if fermi was right there would be no problem but if he was wrong the squad with the jugs and the physicist with the axe would be vaporized before they could blink greg heard the clicking become more rapid he looked anxiously at fermi who was doing calculations with a sliderule fermi looked pleased anyway greg thought if things go wrong it will probably happen so fast that well never know anything about it the rate of clicking levelled off fermi smiled and gave the order for the rod to be pulled out another six inches more scientists were arriving climbing the stairs to the gallery in their heavyweight chicagowinter clothing coats and hats and scarves and gloves greg was appalled at the lack of security no one was checking credentials any one of these men could have been a spy for the japanese among them greg recognized the great szilard tall and heavy with a round face and thick curly hair leo szilard was an idealist who had imagined nuclear power liberating the human race from toil it was with a heavy heart that he had joined the team designing the atom bomb another six inches another increase in the pace of the clicking greg looked at his watch it was eleventhirty suddenly there was a loud crash everyone jumped mchugh said fuck greg said what happened oh i see said mchugh the radiation level activated the safety mechanism and released the emergency control rod thats all fermi announced im hungry lets go to lunch in his italian accent it came out im hungary les go to luncha how could they think about food but no one argued you never know how long an experiment is going to take said mchugh could be all day best to eat when you can greg could have screamed all the control rods were reinserted into the pile and locked into position and everyone left most of them went to a campus canteen greg got a grilledcheese sandwich and sat next to a solemn physicist called wilhelm frunze most scientists were badly dressed but frunze was notably so in a green suit with tan suede trimmings buttonholes collar lining elbow patches pocket flaps this guy was high on gregs suspect list he was german though he had left in the mids and gone to london he was an antinazi but not a communist his politics were socialdemocrat he was married to an american girl an artist talking to him over lunch greg found no reason for suspicion he seemed to love living in america and to be interested in little but his work but with foreigners you could never be quite sure where their ultimate loyalty lay after lunch he stood in the derelict stadium looking at thousands of empty stands and thought about georgy he had told no one he had a son not even margaret cowdry with whom he was now enjoying delightfully carnal relations but he longed to tell his mother he felt proud for no reason he had made no contribution to bringing georgy into the world apart from making love to jacky probably about the easiest thing he had ever done most of all he felt excited he was at the beginning of some kind of adventure georgy was going to grow and learn and change and one day become a man and greg would be there watching and marvelling the scientists reassembled at two oclock now there were about forty people crowded into the gallery with the monitoring equipment the experiment was carefully reset in the position at which they had left off fermi checking his instruments constantly then he said this time withdraw the rod twelve inches the clicks became rapid greg waited for the increase to level off as it had before but it did not instead the clicking became faster and faster until it was continuous roar the radiation level was above the maximum of the counters greg realized when he noticed that everyones attention had switched to the pen recorder its scale was adjustable as the level rose the scale was changed then changed again and again fermi raised a hand they all went silent the pile has gone critical he said he smiled and did nothing greg wanted to scream so turn the fucker off but fermi remained silent and still watching the pen and such was his authority that no one challenged him the chain reaction was happening but it was under control he let it run for a minute then another mchugh muttered jesus christ greg did not want to die he wanted to be a senator he wanted to sleep with margaret cowdry again he wanted to see georgy go to college i havent had half a life yet he thought at last fermi ordered the control rods to be pushed in the noise of the counters reverted to a clicking that gradually slowed and stopped greg breathed normally mchugh was jubilant we proved it he said the chain reaction is real and its controllable more importantly said greg yes i suppose that is more important from the practical point of view greg smiled scientists were like this he knew from harvard for them theory was reality and the world a rather inaccurate model someone produced a bottle of italian wine in a straw basket and some paper cups the scientists all drank a tiny share this was another reason greg was not a scientist they had no idea how to party someone asked fermi to sign the basket he did so then all the others signed it the technicians shut down the monitors everyone began to drift away greg stayed observing after a while he found himself alone in the gallery with fermi and szilard he watched as the two intellectual giants shook hands szilard was a big roundfaced man fermi was elfin and for a moment greg was inappropriately reminded of laurel and hardy then he heard szilard speak my friend he said i think this will go down as a black day in the history of mankind greg thought now what the hell did he mean by that v greg wanted his parents to accept georgy it would not be easy no doubt it would be unnerving for them to be told they had a grandson who had been concealed from them for six years they might be angry on top of that they might look down on jacky they had no right to take a moralistic attitude he thought wryly they themselves had an illegitimate child himself but people were not rational he was not sure how much difference it would make that georgy was black gregs parents were laid back about race and never talked viciously about niggers or kikes as some people of their generation did but they might change when they learned there was a negro in the family his father would be the more difficult one he guessed so he spoke to his mother first he got a few days leave at christmas and went home to her place in buffalo marga had a large apartment in the best building in town she lived mostly alone but she had a cook two maids and a chauffeur she had a safe full of jewellery and a dress closet the size of a twocar garage but she did not have a husband lev was in town but traditionally he took olga out on christmas eve he was still married to her technically though he had not spent a night at her house for years as far as greg knew olga and lev hated one another but for some reason they met once a year that evening greg and his mother had dinner together in the apartment he put on a tuxedo to please her i love to see my men dressed up she often said they had fish soup roast chicken and gregs boyhood favourite peach pie i have some news for you mother he said nervously as the maid poured coffee he feared she would be angry he was not frightened for himself but for georgy and he wondered if this was what parenthood was about worrying about someone else more than you worried about yourself good news she said she had become heavier in recent years but she was still glamorous at fortysix if there was any grey in her dark hair it had been carefully camouflaged by her hairdresser tonight she wore a simple black dress and a diamond choker very good news but i guess a little surprising so please dont fly off the handle she raised a black eyebrow but said nothing he reached inside his dinner jacket and took out a photograph it showed georgy on a red bicycle with a ribbon around the handlebars the rear wheel of the bike had a pair of stabilizing wheels so that it would not fall over the expression on the boys face was ecstatic greg was kneeling beside him looking proud he handed the picture to his mother she studied it thoughtfully after a minute she said im assuming you gave this little boy a bicycle for christmas thats right she looked up are you telling me you have a child greg nodded his name is georgy are you married no she threw down the photo for gods sake she said angrily what is the matter with you peshkov men greg was dismayed i dont know what you mean another illegitimate child another woman bringing him up alone he realized that she saw jacky as a younger version of herself mother i was fifteen why cant you be normal she stormed for the love of jesus christ whats wrong with having a regular family greg looked down theres nothing wrong with it he felt ashamed until this moment he had seen himself as a passive player in this drama even a victim everything that had happened had been done to him by his father and jacky but his mother did not view it that way and now he saw that she was right he had not thought twice about sleeping with jacky he had not questioned her when she had said airily that there was no need to worry about contraception and he had not confronted his father when jacky left he had been very young yes but if he was old enough to fuck her he was old enough to take responsibility for the consequences his mother was still raging dont you remember how you used to carry on where is my daddy why doesnt he sleep here why cant we go with him to daisys house and then later the fights you had at school when the boys called you a bastard and you were so angry to be refused membership of that goddamned yacht club of course i remember she banged a beringed fist on the table causing crystal glasses to shake then how can you put another little boy through the same torture i didnt know he existed until two months ago father scared the mother away who is she her name is jacky jakes shes a waitress he took out another photo his mother sighed a pretty negress she was calming down she was hoping to be an actress but i guess she gave that up when georgy came along marga nodded a baby will ruin your career faster than a dose of the clap mother assumed that an actress had to sleep with the right people to progress greg noted how the hell would she know but then she had been a nightclub singer when his father met her he did not want to go down that road she said what did you give her for christmas medical insurance good choice better than a fluffy bear greg heard a step in the hall his father was home hastily he said mother will you meet jacky will you accept georgy as your grandson her hand went to her mouth oh my god im a grandmother she did not know whether to be shocked or pleased greg leaned forward i dont want father to reject him please before she could reply lev came into the room marga said hello darling how was your evening he sat at the table looking grumpy well ive had my shortcomings explained to me in full detail so i guess i had a great time you poor thing did you get enough to eat i can make you an omelette in a minute the food was fine the photographs were on the table but lev had not noticed them yet the maid came in and said would you like coffee mr peshkov no thank you marga said bring the vodka in case mr peshkov would like a drink later yes maam greg noticed how solicitous marga was about levs comfort and pleasure he guessed that was why lev was here not at olgas for the night the maid brought a bottle and three small glasses on a silver tray lev still drank vodka the russian way warm and neat greg said father you know jacky jakes her again lev said irritably yes because theres something you dont know about her that got his attention he hated to think other people knew things he did not what she has a child he pushed the photographs across the polished table it it yours hes six years old what do you think she kept this pretty damned quiet she was scared of you what did she think i might do cook the baby and eat it i dont know father youre the expert at scaring people lev gave him a hard look youre learning though he was talking about the scene with the razor maybe i am learning to scare people greg thought lev said why are you showing me these photos i thought you might like to know that you have a grandson by a goddamn twobit actress who was hoping to snag herself a rich man marga said darling please remember that i was a twobit nightclub singer hoping to snag myself a rich man he looked furious for a moment he glared at marga then his expression changed you know what he said youre right who am i to judge jacky jakes greg and marga stared at him astonished at this sudden humility he said im just like her i was a twokopek hoodlum from the slums of st petersburg until i married olga vyalov my bosss daughter greg caught his mothers eye and she gave an almost imperceptible shrug that simply said you never can tell lev looked again at the photo apart from the colour this kid looks like my brother grigori theres a surprise until now i thought all these piccaninnies looked the same greg could hardly breathe will you see him father will you come with me and meet your grandson hell yes lev uncorked the bottle poured vodka into three glasses and passed them round whats the boys name anyway georgy lev raised his glass so heres to georgy they all drank i lloyd williams walked along a narrow uphill path at the tail end of a line of desperate fugitives he breathed easily he was used to this he had now crossed the pyrenees several times he wore ropesoled espadrilles that gave his feet a better grip on the rocky ground he had a heavy coat on top of his blue overalls the sun was hot now but later when the party reached higher altitudes and the sun went down the temperature would drop below freezing ahead of him were two sturdy ponies three local people and eight weary bedraggled escapers all loaded with packs there were three american airmen the surviving crew of a b liberator bomber that had crashlanded in belgium two more were british officers who had escaped from the oflag prisonerofwar camp in strasbourg the others were a czech communist a jewish woman with a violin and a mysterious englishman called watermill who was probably some kind of spy they had all come a long way and suffered many hardships this was the last leg of their journey and the most dangerous if captured now they would all be tortured until they betrayed the brave men and women who had helped them en route leading the party was teresa the climb was hard work for people who were not used to it but they had to keep up a brisk pace to minimize their exposure and lloyd had found that the refugees were less likely to fall behind when they were led by a small ravishingly pretty woman the path levelled and broadened into a small clearing suddenly a loud voice rang out speaking french with a german accent it shouted halt the column came to an abrupt halt two german soldiers emerged from behind a rock they carried standard mauser boltaction rifles each holding five rounds of ammunition reflexively lloyd touched the overcoat pocket that contained his loaded mm luger pistol escaping from mainland europe had become harder and lloyds job had grown even more dangerous at the end of last year the germans had occupied the southern half of france contemptuously ignoring the vichy french government like the flimsy sham it had always been a forbidden zone ten miles deep was declared all along the frontier with spain lloyd and his party were in that zone now teresa addressed the soldiers in french good morning gentlemen is everything all right lloyd knew her well and he could hear the tremor of fear in her voice but he hoped it was too faint for the sentries to notice among the french police there were many fascists and a few communists but all of them were lazy and none wanted to chase refugees across the icy passes of the pyrenees however the germans did german troops had moved into border towns and begun to patrol the hill paths and mule trails lloyd and teresa used the occupiers were not crack troops those were fighting in russia where they had recently surrendered stalingrad after a long and murderous struggle many of the germans in france were old men boys and the walking wounded but that seemed to make them more determined to prove themselves unlike the french they rarely turned a blind eye now the older of the two soldiers cadaverously thin with a grey moustache said to teresa where are you going to the village of lamont we have groceries for you and your comrades this particular german unit had moved into a remote hill village kicking out the local inhabitants then they had realized how difficult it was to supply troops in that location it had been a stroke of genius on teresas part to undertake to carry food to them at a healthy profit and thereby get permission to enter the prohibited zone the thin soldier looked suspiciously at the men with their backpacks all this is for german soldiers i hope so teresa said theres no one else up here to sell it to she took a piece of paper from her pocket heres the order signed by your sergeant eisenstein the man read it carefully and handed it back then he looked at lieutenantcolonel will donelly a beefy american pilot is he french lloyd put his hand on the gun in his pocket the appearance of the fugitives was a problem in this part of the world the local people french and spanish were usually small and dark and everyone was thin both lloyd and teresa fitted that description as did the czech and the violinist but the british were pale and fairhaired and the americans were huge teresa said guillaume was born in normandy all that butter the younger of the two soldiers a pale boy with glasses smiled at teresa she was easy to smile at do you have wine he said of course the two sentries brightened visibly teresa said would you like some right now the older man said its thirsty in the sun lloyd opened a pannier on one of the ponies took out four bottles of roussillon white wine and handed them over the germans took two each suddenly everyone was smiling and shaking hands the older sentry said carry on friends the fugitives went on lloyd had not really expected trouble but you could never be sure and he was relieved to have got past the sentry post it took them two more hours to reach lamont a dirtpoor hamlet with a handful of crude houses and some empty sheep pens it stood on the edge of a small upland plain where the new spring grass was just beginning to show lloyd pitied the people who had lived here they had had so little and even that had been taken from them the party walked into the centre of the village and gratefully unshouldered their burdens they were surrounded by german soldiers this was the most dangerous moment lloyd thought sergeant eisenstein was in charge of a platoon of fifteen or twenty men everyone helped to unload the supplies bread sausage fresh fish condensed milk canned food the soldiers were pleased to get supplies and glad to see new faces they merrily attempted to engage their benefactors in conversation the fugitives had to say as little as possible this was the moment when they could so easily betray themselves by a slip some germans spoke french well enough to detect an english or american accent even those who had passable accents such as teresa and lloyd could give themselves away with a grammatical error it was so easy to say sur le table instead of sur la table but it was a mistake no french person would ever make to compensate the two genuine frenchmen in the party went out of their way to be voluble any time a soldier began to talk to a fugitive someone would jump into the conversation teresa presented the sergeant with a bill and he took a long time to check the numbers then count out the money at last they were able to take their leave with empty backpacks and lighter hearts they walked back down the mountain half a mile then they split up teresa went on down with the frenchmen and the horses lloyd and the fugitives turned on to an upward path the german sentries at the clearing would probably be too drunk by now to notice that fewer people were coming down than went up but if they asked questions teresa would say some of the party had started a card game with the soldiers and would be following later then there would be a change of shift and the germans would lose track lloyd made his group walk for two hours then he allowed them a tenminute break they had all been given bottles of water and packets of dried figs for energy they were discouraged from bringing anything else lloyd knew from experience that treasured books silverware ornaments and gramophone records would become too heavy and be thrown into a snowfilled ravine long before the footsore travellers crested the pass this was the hard part from now on it would only get darker and colder and rockier just before the snowline he instructed them to refill their water bottles at a clear cold stream when night fell they kept going it was dangerous to let people sleep they might freeze to death they were tired and they slipped and stumbled on the icy rocks inevitably their pace slowed lloyd could not let the line spread stragglers might lose their way and there were precipitous ravines for the careless to fall into but he had never lost anyone yet many of the fugitives were officers and this was the point where they would sometimes challenge lloyd arguing when he ordered them to keep going lloyd had been promoted to major to give him more authority in the middle of the night when their morale was at rock bottom lloyd announced you are now in neutral spain and they raised a ragged cheer in truth he did not know exactly where the border was and always made the announcement when they seemed most in need of a boost their spirits lifted again when dawn broke they still had some way to go but the route now led downhill and their cold limbs gradually thawed at sunrise they skirted a small town with a dustcoloured church at the top of a hill just beyond they reached a large barn beside the road inside was a green ford flatbed truck with a grimy canvas cover the lorry was large enough to carry the whole party at the wheel was captain silva a middleaged englishman of spanish descent who worked with lloyd also there to lloyds surprise was major lowther who had been in charge of the intelligence course at tŷ gwyn and had been snootily disapproving or perhaps just envious of lloyds friendship with daisy lloyd knew that lowthie had been posted to the british embassy in madrid and guessed he worked for mi the secret intelligence service but he would not have expected to see him this far from the capital lowther wore an expensive white flannel suit that was crumpled and grubby he stood beside the truck looking proprietorial ill take over from here williams he said he looked at the fugitives which one of you is watermill watermill could have been a real name or a code the mysterious englishman stepped forward and shook hands im major lowther im taking you straight to madrid turning back to lloyd he said im afraid your party will have to make your way to the nearest railway station just a minute said lloyd that truck belongs to my organization he had purchased it with his budget from mi the department that helped escaping prisoners and the driver works for me cant be helped lowther said briskly watermill has priority the secret intelligence service always thought they had priority i dont agree lloyd said i see no reason why we cant all go to barcelona in the truck as planned then you can take watermill on to madrid by train i didnt ask for your opinion laddie just do as youre told watermill himself interjected in a reasonable tone im perfectly happy to share the truck leave this to me please lowther told him lloyd said all these people have just walked across the pyrenees theyre exhausted then theyd better have a rest before going on lloyd shook his head too dangerous the town on the hill has a sympathetic mayor thats why we rendezvous here but farther down the valley their politics are different the gestapo are everywhere you know that and most of the spanish police are on their side not ours my group will be in serious danger of arrest for entering the country illegally and you know how difficult it is to get people out of francos jails even when theyre innocent im not going to waste my time arguing with you i outrank you no you dont what im a major so dont call me laddie ever again unless you want a punch on the nose my mission is urgent so why didnt you bring your own vehicle because this one was available but it wasnt will donelly the big american stepped forward im with major williams he drawled hes just saved my life you major lowther havent done shit thats got nothing to do with it said lowther well the situation here seems pretty clear donelly said the truck is under the authority of major williams major lowther wants it but he cant have it end of story lowther said you keep out of this i happen to be a lieutenantcolonel so i guess i outrank you both but this isnt under your jurisdiction nor yours evidently donelly turned to lloyd should we get going i insist spluttered lowther donelly turned back to him major lowther he said shut the fuck up and thats an order lloyd said all right everybody climb aboard lowther glared furiously at lloyd ill get you for this you little welsh bastard he said ii the daffodils were out in london on the day daisy and boy went for their medical the visit to the doctor was daisys idea she was fed up with boy blaming her for not getting pregnant he constantly compared her to his brother andys wife may who now had three children there must be something wrong with you he had said aggressively i got pregnant once before she winced at the remembered pain of her miscarriage then she recalled how lloyd had taken care of her and she felt a different kind of pain boy said something could have happened since then to make you infertile or you what do you mean there might just as easily be something wrong with you dont be absurd tell you what ill make a deal the thought flashed through her mind that she was negotiating rather as her father lev might have done ill go for an examination if you will that had surprised him and he had hesitated then said all right you go first if they say theres nothing wrong with you ill go no she said you go first why because i dont trust you to keep your promises all right then well go together daisy was not sure why she was bothering she did not love boy had not loved him for a long time she was in love with lloyd williams still in spain on a mission he could not say much about but she was married to boy he had been unfaithful to her of course with numerous women but she had committed adultery too albeit with only one man she had no moral ground to stand on and in consequence she was paralysed she just felt that if she did her duty as a wife she might retain the last shreds of her selfrespect the doctors office was in harley street not far from their house though in a less expensive neighbourhood daisy found the examination unpleasant the doctor was a man and he was grumpy about her being ten minutes late he asked her a lot of questions about her general health her menstrual periods and what he called her relations with her husband not looking at her but making notes with a fountain pen then he put a series of cold metal instruments up her vagina i do this every day so you dont need to worry he said then he gave her a grin that told her the opposite when she came out of the doctors office she half expected boy to renege on their deal and refuse to take his turn he looked sour about it but he went in while she was waiting daisy reread a letter from her halfbrother greg he had discovered he had a child from an affair he had with a black girl when he was fifteen to daisys astonishment the playboy greg was excited about his son and keen to be part of the childs life albeit as an uncle rather than a father even more surprising lev had met the child and announced that he was smart it was ironic she thought that greg had a son even though he had never wanted one and boy had no son even though he longed for one so badly boy came out of the doctors office an hour later the doctor promised to give them their results in a week they left at twelve noon i need a drink after that boy said so do i said daisy they looked up and down the street of identical row houses this neighbourhood is a bloody desert not a pub in sight im not going to a pub said daisy i want a martini and they dont know how to make them in pubs she spoke from experience she had asked for a dry martini at the kings head in chelsea and had been served a glass of disgustingly warm vermouth take me to claridges hotel please its only five minutes walk now thats a damn good idea the bar at claridges was full of people they knew there were austerity rules about the meals restaurants could sell but claridges had found a loophole there were no restrictions on giving food away so they offered a free buffet charging only their usual high prices for drinks daisy and boy sat in art deco splendour and sipped perfect cocktails and daisy began to feel better the doctor asked me if id had mumps boy said but you have it was mainly a childhood illness but boy had caught it a couple of years back he had been briefly billeted at a vicarage in east anglia and had picked up the infection from the vicars three small sons it had been very painful did he say why no you know what these chaps are like never tell you a bloody thing it occurred to daisy that she was not as happygolucky as she had once been in the old days she would never have brooded about her marriage this way she had always liked what scarlett ohara said in gone with the wind ill think about that tomorrow not any more perhaps she was growing up boy was ordering a second cocktail when daisy looked towards the door and saw the marquis of lowther walking in dressed in a creased and stained uniform daisy disliked him ever since he had guessed at her relationship with lloyd he had treated her with oily familiarity as if they shared a secret that made them intimates now he sat at their table uninvited dropping cigar ash on his khaki trousers and asked for a manhattan daisy knew at once that he was up to no good there was a look of malignant relish in his eye that could not be explained merely as anticipation of a good cocktail boy said i havent seen you for a year or so lowthie where have you been madrid lowthie said cant say much about it hushhush you know how about you i spend a lot of time training pilots though ive flown a few missions lately now that weve stepped up the bombing of germany jolly good thing too give the germans a taste of their own medicine you may say that but theres a lot of muttering among the pilots really why because all this stuff about military targets is absolute rubbish theres no point in bombing german factories because they just rebuild them so were targeting large areas of dense workingclass housing they cant replace the workers so fast lowther looked shocked that would mean its our policy to kill civilians exactly but the government assures us the government lies boy said and the bomber crews know it many of them dont give a damn of course but some feel bad they believe that if were doing the right thing then we should say so and if were doing the wrong thing we should stop lowther looked uneasy im not sure we should be talking like this here youre probably right boy said the second round of cocktails came lowther turned to daisy and what about the little woman he said you must have some war work the devil finds mischief for idle hands according to the proverb daisy replied in a neutral matteroffact tone now that the blitz is over they dont need women ambulance drivers so im working with the american red cross we have an office in pall mall we do what we can to help american servicemen over here men lonely for a bit of feminine company eh mostly theyre just homesick they like to hear an american accent lowthie leered i expect youre very good at consoling them i do what i can i bet you do boy said look here lowthie are you a bit drunk because this sort of talk is awfully bad form you know lowthers expression turned spiteful oh come on boy dont tell me you dont know what are you blind daisy said take me home please boy he ignored her and spoke to lowther what the devil do you mean ask her about lloyd williams boy said who the hell is lloyd williams daisy said im going home alone if you wont take me do you know a lloyd williams daisy hes your brother daisy thought and she felt a powerful impulse to reveal the secret and knock him sideways but she resisted the temptation you know him she said he was up at cambridge with you he took us to a music hall in the east end years ago oh said boy remembering then puzzled he said to lowther him it was difficult for boy to see someone such as lloyd as a rival with growing incredulity he added a man who cant even afford his own dress clothes lowther said three years ago he was on my intelligence course down at tŷ gwyn while daisy was living there you were risking your life in a hawker hurricane over france at the time i seem to remember she was dallying with that welsh weasel in your familys house boy was getting red in the face if youre making this up lowthie by god ill thrash you ask your wife said lowther with a confident grin boy turned to daisy she had not slept with lloyd at tŷ gwyn she had slept with him in his own bed at his mothers house during the blitz but she could not explain that to boy in front of lowther and anyway it was a detail the accusation of adultery was true and she was not going to deny it the secret was out all she wanted now was to retain some semblance of dignity she said i will tell you everything you want to know boy but not in front of this leering slob boy raised his voice in astonishment so you dont deny it the people at the next table looked around seemed embarrassed and returned their attention to their drinks daisy raised her own voice i refuse to be crossexamined in the bar of claridges hotel you admit it then he shouted the room went quiet daisy stood up i dont admit or deny anything here ill tell you everything in private at home which is where civilized couples discuss such matters my god you did it you slept with him boy roared even the waiters had paused in their work and were standing still watching the row daisy walked to the door boy yelled you slut daisy was not going to exit on that line she turned around you know about sluts of course i had the misfortune to meet two of yours remember she looked around the room joanie and pearl she said contemptuously how many wives would put up with that she went out before he could reply she stepped into a waiting taxi as it pulled away she saw boy emerge from the hotel and get into the next cab in line she gave the driver her address in a way she felt relieved that the truth was out but she also felt terribly sad something had ended she knew the house was only a quarter of a mile away as she arrived boys taxi pulled up behind hers he followed her into the hall she could not stay here with him she realized that was over she would never again share his home or his bed bring me a suitcase please she said to the butler very good my lady she looked around it was an eighteenthcentury town house of perfect proportions with an elegantly curving staircase but she was not really sorry to leave it boy said where are you going to a hotel i suppose probably not claridges to meet your lover no hes overseas but yes i do love him im sorry boy you have no right to judge me your offences are worse but i judge myself thats it he said im going to divorce you those were the words she had been waiting for she realized now they had been said and everything was over her new life began from this moment she sighed thank god she said iii daisy rented an apartment in piccadilly it had a large americanstyle bathroom with a shower there were two separate toilets one for guests a ridiculous extravagance in the eyes of most english people fortunately money was not an issue for daisy her grandfather vyalov had left her rich and she had had control of her own fortune since she was twentyone and it was all in american dollars new furniture was difficult to buy so she shopped for antiques of which there were plenty for sale cheap she hung modern paintings for a gay youthful look she hired an elderly laundress and a girl to clean and found it was easy to manage the place without a butler or a cook especially when you did not have a husband to mollycoddle the servants at the mayfair house packed all her clothes and sent them to her in a pantechnicon daisy and the laundress spent an afternoon opening the boxes and putting everything away tidily she had been both humiliated and liberated on balance she thought she was better off the wound of rejection would heal but she would be free of boy for ever after a week she wondered what had been the results of the medical examination the doctor would have reported to boy of course as the husband she did not want to ask him and anyway it did not seem important any longer so she forgot about it she enjoyed making a new home for a couple of weeks she was too busy to socialize when she had fixed up the apartment she decided to see all the friends she had been ignoring she had a lot of friends in london she had been here seven years for the last four years boy had been away more than he was home and she had gone to parties and balls on her own so being without a husband would not make much difference to her life she figured no doubt she would be crossed off the fitzherbert familys invitation lists but they were not the only people in london society she bought crates of whisky gin and champagne scouring london for what little was available legitimately and buying the rest on the black market then she sent out invitations to a flatwarming party the responses came back with ominous promptness and they were all declines in tears she phoned eva murray why wont anyone come to my party she wailed eva was at her door ten minutes later she arrived with three children and a nanny jamie was six anna four and baby karen two daisy showed her around the apartment then ordered tea while jamie turned the couch into a tank using his sisters as crew speaking english with a mixture of german american and scots accents eva said daisy dear this isnt rome i know are you sure youre comfortable eva was heavily pregnant with her fourth child would you mind if i put my feet up of course not daisy fetched a cushion london society is respectable eva went on dont imagine i approve of it i have been excluded often and poor jimmy is snubbed sometimes for having married a halfjewish german thats awful i wouldnt wish it on anyone whatever the reason sometimes i hate the british youre forgetting what americans are like dont you remember telling me that all the girls in buffalo were snobs daisy laughed what a long time ago it seems youve left your husband eva said and you did so in undeniably spectacular fashion hurling insults at him in the bar of claridges hotel and id only had one martini eva grinned how i wish id been there i kind of wish i hadnt needless to say everyone in london society has talked about little else for the last three weeks i guess i should have anticipated that now im afraid anyone who appears at your party will be seen as approving of adultery and divorce even i wouldnt like my motherinlaw to know id come here and had tea with you but its so unfair boy was unfaithful first and you thought women were treated equally daisy remembered that eva had a great deal more to worry about than snobbery her family was still in nazi germany fitz had made inquiries through the swiss embassy and learned that her doctor father was now in a concentration camp and her brother a violin maker had been beaten up by the police his hands smashed when i think about your troubles im ashamed of myself for complaining daisy said dont be but cancel the party daisy did but it made her miserable her work for the red cross filled her days but in the evenings she had nowhere to go and nothing to do she went to the movies twice a week she tried to read moby dick but found it tedious one sunday she went to church st jamess the wren church opposite her apartment building in piccadilly had been bombed so she went to st martininthefields boy was not there but fitz and bea were and daisy spent the service looking at the back of fitzs head reflecting that she had fallen in love with two of this mans sons boy had his mothers looks and his fathers singleminded selfishness lloyd had fitzs good looks and ethels big heart why did it take me so long to see that she wondered the church was full of people she knew and after the service none of them spoke to her she was lonely and almost friendless in a foreign country in the middle of a war one evening she took a taxi to aldgate and knocked at the leckwith house when ethel opened the door daisy said ive come to ask for your sons hand in marriage ethel let out a peal of laughter and hugged her she had brought a gift an american tin of ham she had got from a usaf navigator such things were luxuries to british families on rations she sat in the kitchen with ethel and bernie listening to dance tunes on the radio they all sang along with underneath the arches by flanagan and allen bud flanagan was born right here in the east end bernie said proudly real name chaim reuben weintrop the leckwiths were excited about the beveridge report a government paper that had become a bestseller commissioned under a conservative prime minister and written by a liberal economist said bernie yet it proposes what the labour party has always wanted you know youre winning in politics when your opponents steal your ideas ethel said the idea is that everyone of working age should pay a weekly insurance premium then get benefits when they are sick unemployed retired or widowed a simple proposal but it will transform our country bernie said enthusiastically cradle to grave no one will ever be destitute again daisy said has the government accepted it no said ethel clem attlee pressed churchill very hard but churchill wont endorse the report the treasury thinks it will cost too much bernie said well have to win an election before we can implement it ethel and bernies daughter millie dropped in i cant stay long she said abies watching the children for half an hour she had lost her job women were not buying expensive gowns now even if they could afford them but fortunately her husbands leather business was flourishing and they had two babies lennie and pammie they drank cocoa and talked about the young man they all adored they had little real news of lloyd every six or eight months ethel received a letter on the headed paper of the british embassy in madrid saying he was safe and well and doing his bit to defeat fascism he had been promoted to major he had never written to daisy for fear boy might see the letters but now he could daisy gave ethel the address of her new flat and took down lloyds address which was a british forces post office number they had no idea when he might come home on leave daisy told them about her halfbrother greg and his son georgy she knew that the leckwiths of all people would not be censorious and would be able to rejoice in such news she also told the story of evas family in berlin bernie was jewish and tears came to his eyes when he heard about rudis broken hands they should have fought the bastard fascists on the street when they had the chance he said thats what we did millie said ive still got the scars on my back where the police pushed us through gardiners plateglass window i used to be ashamed of them abie never saw my back until wed been married six months but he says they make him proud of me it wasnt pretty the fighting in cable street said bernie but we put a stop to their bloody nonsense he took off his glasses and wiped his eyes with his handkerchief ethel put her arm around his shoulders i told people to stay home that day she said i was wrong and you were right he smiled ruefully doesnt happen often but it was the public order act brought in after cable street that finished the british fascists ethel said parliament banned the wearing of political uniforms in public that finished them if they couldnt strut up and down in their black shirts they were nothing the conservatives did that credit where credits due always a political family the leckwiths were planning the postwar reform of britain by the labour party their leader the quietly brilliant clement attlee was now deputy prime minister under churchill and union hero ernie bevin was minister of labour their vision made daisy feel excited about the future millie left and bernie went to bed when they were alone ethel said to daisy do you really want to marry my lloyd more than anything in the world do you think it will be all right i do why not because we come from such different backgrounds youre all such good people you live for public service except for our millie shes like bernies brother she wants to make money even she has scars on her back from cable street true lloyd is like you political work isnt something extra he does like a hobby its the centre of his life and im a selfish millionaire i think there are two kinds of marriage ethel said thoughtfully one is a comfortable partnership where two people share the same hopes and fears raise children as a team and give each other comfort and help she was talking about herself and bernie daisy realized the other is a wild passion madness and joy and sex possibly with someone completely unsuitable maybe someone you dont admire or dont even really like she was thinking about her affair with fitz daisy felt sure she held her breath she knew ethel was now telling her the raw truth ive been lucky ive had both ethel said and heres my advice to you if you get the chance of the mad kind of love grab it with both hands and to hell with the consequences wow said daisy she left a few minutes later she felt privileged that ethel had given her a glimpse into her soul but when she got back to her empty apartment she felt depressed she made a cocktail and poured it away she put the kettle on and took it off again the radio went off the air she lay between cold sheets and wished lloyd was there she compared lloyds family with her own both had troubled histories but ethel had forged a strong supportive family out of unfavourable materials which daisys own mother had been unable to do though that was more levs fault than olgas ethel was a remarkable woman and lloyd had many of her qualities where was he now and what was he doing whatever the answer he was sure to be in danger would he be killed now when at last she was free to love him without restraint and eventually to marry him what would she do if he died her own life would be at an end she felt no husband no lover no friends no country in the early hours of the morning she cried herself to sleep next day she slept late at midday she was drinking coffee in her little dining room dressed in a black silk wrap when her fifteenyearold maid came in and said major williams is here my lady what she screeched he cant be then he came through the door with his kitbag over his shoulder he looked tired and had several days growth of beard and he had evidently slept in his uniform she threw her arms around him and kissed his bristly face he kissed her back inhibited somewhat by being unable to stop grinning i must stink he said between kisses i havent changed my clothes for a week you smell like a cheese factory she said i love it she pulled him into her bedroom and started to take his clothes off ill take a quick shower he said no she said she pushed him back on the bed im in too much of a hurry her longing for him was frantic and the truth was that she relished the strong smell it should have repelled her but it had the opposite effect it was him the man she had thought might be dead and he was filling her nostrils and her lungs she could have wept with joy taking off his trousers would require removing his boots and she could see that would be complicated so she did not bother she just unbuttoned his fly she threw off her black silk robe and hiked her nightdress up to her waist all the time staring with happy lust at the white penis sticking up out of the rough khaki cloth then she straddled him easing herself down and leaned forward and kissed him oh god she said i cant tell you how much ive been longing for you she lay on him not moving much kissing him again and again he held her face in his hands and stared at her this is real isnt it he said not just another happy dream its real she said good i wouldnt like to wake up now i want to stay like this for ever nice idea but i cant keep still much longer he began to move under her if you do that ill come she said and she did afterwards they lay on her bed for a long time talking he had two weeks leave live here she said you can visit your parents every day but i want you at night i wouldnt like you to get a bad reputation that ship has sailed ive already been shunned by london society i know he had telephoned ethel from waterloo station and she had told him about daisys separation from boy and given him the address of the flat we must do something about contraception he said ill get some rubber johnnies but you might want to get fixed up with a device what do you think you want to make sure i dont get pregnant she said there was a note of sadness in her voice she realized and he heard it dont get me wrong he said he raised himself on his elbow im illegitimate i was told lies about my parentage and when i found out the truth it was a terrible shock his voice shook a little with emotion ill never put my children through that never we wouldnt have to lie to them would we tell them that were not married that in fact youre married to someone else i dont see why not think how they would be teased at school she was not convinced but clearly the issue was a profound one for him so whats your plan she said i want us to have children but not until were married to each other i get that she said so we have to wait men were slow to pick up hints im not much of a girl for tradition she said but still there are some things at last he saw what she was getting at oh okay just a minute he knelt upright on the bed daisy dear she burst out laughing he looked comical in full uniform with his limp dick hanging out of his fly can i take a photo of you like that she said he looked down and saw what she meant oh sorry no dont you dare put it away stay just as you are and say what you were going to say he grinned daisy dear will you be my wife in a heartbeat she said they lay down again embracing soon the novelty of his odour wore off they got into the shower together she soaped him all over taking merry pleasure in his embarrassment when she washed his most intimate places she put shampoo on his hair and scrubbed his grimy feet with a brush when he was clean he insisted on washing her but he had only got as far as her breasts when they had to make love again they did it standing in the shower with the hot water coursing down their bodies clearly he had momentarily forgotten his aversion to illegitimate pregnancy and she did not care afterwards he stood at her mirror shaving she wrapped a large towel around herself and sat on the lid of the toilet watching him he asked how long will it take you to get divorced i dont know id better speak to boy not today though i want you to myself all day when will you go to see your parents tomorrow maybe then ill go to see boy at the same time i want to get this over as soon as possible good he said thats settled then iv daisy felt strange going into the house where she had lived with boy a month ago it had been hers she had been free to come and go as she wished and enter any room without asking permission the servants had obeyed her every order without question now she was a stranger in the same house she kept her hat and gloves on and she had to follow the old butler as he led her to the morning room boy did not shake hands or kiss her cheek he looked full of righteous indignation i havent hired a lawyer yet daisy said as she sat down i wanted to talk to you personally first im hoping we can do this without hating one another after all there are no children to fight over and we both have plenty of money you betrayed me he said daisy sighed clearly it was not going to go the way she had hoped we both committed adultery she said you first ive been humiliated everyone in london knows i did try to stop you making a fool of yourself in claridges but you were too busy humiliating me i hope youve thrashed the loathsome marquis how could i he did me a favour he might have done you a bigger favour by having a quiet word at the club i dont understand how you could fall for such a lowclass oik as williams ive found out a few things about him his mother was a housemaid shes probably the most impressive woman ive ever met i hope you realize that no one really knows who his father is that was about as ironic as you could get daisy thought i know who his father is she said who im certainly not telling you there you are then this isnt getting us anywhere is it no perhaps i should just have a lawyer write to you she stood up i loved you once boy she said sadly you were fun im sorry i wasnt enough for you i wish you happiness i hope you marry someone who suits you better and that she gives you lots of sons i would be happy for you if that came about well it wont he said she had turned towards the door but now she looked back why do you say that i got the report from that doctor we went to she had forgotten about the medical it had seemed irrelevant after they split what did he say theres nothing wrong with you you can have a whole litter of pups but i cant father children mumps in adult men sometimes causes infertility and i copped it he laughed bitterly all those bloody germans shooting at me for years and ive been downed by a vicars three little brats she felt sad for him oh boy im really sorry to hear that well youre going to be sorrier because im not divorcing you she suddenly felt cold what do you mean why not why should i bother i dont want to marry again i cant have children andys son will inherit but i want to marry lloyd why should i care about that why should he have children if i cant daisy was devastated would happiness be snatched away from her just when it seemed to be within her reach boy you cant mean this ive never been more serious in my life her voice was anguished but lloyd wants children of his own he should have thought of that before he fffucked another mans wife very well then she said defiantly ill divorce you on what grounds adultery of course but you have no evidence she was about to say that that shouldnt be a problem when he grinned maliciously and added and ill take care you dont get any he could do that if he was discreet about his liaisons she realized with growing horror but you threw me out she said i shall tell the judge youre welcome to come home any time she tried to stop herself crying i never thought youd hate me this much she said miserably didnt you said boy well now you bloody well know v lloyd williams went to boy fitzherberts house in mayfair at midmorning when boy would be sober and told the butler he was major williams a distant relative he thought a mantoman conversation was worth a try surely boy did not really want to dedicate the rest of his life to revenge lloyd was in uniform hoping to appeal to boy as one fighting man to another good sense must surely prevail he was shown into the morning room where boy sat reading the paper and smoking a cigar it took boy a moment to recognize him you he said when comprehension dawned you can piss off right away ive come to ask you to give daisy a divorce lloyd said get out boy got to his feet lloyd said i can see that youre toying with the idea of taking a swing at me so in fairness i should tell you that it wont be as easy as you imagine im a bit smaller than you but i box at welterweight and ive won quite a lot of contests im not going to soil my hands on you good decision but will you reconsider the divorce absolutely not theres something you dont know lloyd said i wonder if it might change your mind i doubt it boy said but go on now that youre here give it a shot he sat down but did not offer lloyd a chair be it on your own head lloyd thought he took from his pocket a faded sepia photograph if youd be so kind glance at this picture of me he put it on the side table next to boys ashtray boy picked it up this isnt you it looks like you but the uniform is victorian it must be your father my grandfather in fact turn it over boy read the inscription on the back earl fitzherbert he said scornfully yes the previous earl your grandfather and mine daisy found that photo at tŷ gwyn lloyd took a deep breath you told daisy that no one knows who my father is well i can tell you its earl fitzherbert you and i are brothers he waited for boys response boy laughed ridiculous my reaction exactly when i was first told well i must say you have surprised me i would have thought you could come up with something better than this absurd fantasy lloyd had been hoping the revelation would shock boy into a different frame of mind but so far it was not working nevertheless he continued to reason come on boy how unlikely is it doesnt it happen all the time in great houses maids are pretty young noblemen are randy and nature takes its course when a baby is born the matter is hushed up please dont pretend you had no idea such things could occur no doubt its common enough boys confidence was shaken but still he blustered however lots of people pretend they have connections with the aristocracy oh please lloyd said disparagingly i dont want connections with the aristocracy im not a drapers assistant with daydreams of grandeur i come from a distinguished family of socialist politicians my maternal grandfather was one of the founders of the south wales miners federation the last thing i need is a wrongsideoftheblanket link with a tory peer its highly embarrassing to me boy laughed again but with less conviction youre embarrassed talk about inverted snobbery inverted im more likely to become prime minister than you are lloyd realized they had got into a pissing contest which was not what he wanted never mind that he said im trying to persuade you that you cant spend the rest of your life taking revenge on me if only because were brothers i still dont believe it boy said putting the photo down on the side table and picking up his cigar nor did i at first lloyd kept trying his whole future was at stake then it was pointed out to me that my mother was working at tŷ gwyn when she fell pregnant that she had always been evasive about my fathers identity and that shortly before i was born she somehow acquired the funds to buy a threebedroom house in london i confronted her with my suspicions and she admitted the truth this is laughable but you know its true dont you i know no such thing you do though for the sake of our brotherhood wont you do the decent thing certainly not lloyd saw that he was not going to win he felt downcast boy had the power to blight lloyds life and he was determined to use it he picked up the photograph and put it back in his pocket youll ask our father about this you wont be able to restrain yourself youll have to find out boy made a scornful noise lloyd went to the door i believe he will tell you the truth goodbye boy he went out and closed the door behind him ii colonel albert beck got a russian bullet in his right lung at kharkov in march he was lucky a field surgeon put in a chest drain and reinflated the lung saving his life just weakened by blood loss and the almost inevitable infection beck was put on a train home and ended up in carlas hospital in berlin he was a tough wiry man in his early forties prematurely bald with a protruding jaw like the prow of a viking longboat the first time he spoke to carla he was drugged and feverish and wildly indiscreet were losing the war he said she was immediately alert a discontented officer was a potential source of information she said lightly the newspapers say were shortening the line on the eastern front he laughed scornfully that means were retreating she continued to draw him out and italy looks bad the italian dictator benito mussolini hitlers greatest ally had fallen remember and beck said nostalgically one brilliant lightning victory after another those were the days clearly he was not ideological perhaps not even political he was a normal patriotic soldier who had stopped kidding himself carla led him on it cant be true that the army is short of everything from bullets to underpants this kind of mildly risky talk was not unusual in berlin nowadays of course we are beck was radically disinhibited but quite articulate germany simply cant produce as many guns and tanks as the soviet union great britain and the united states combined especially when were being bombed constantly and no matter how many russians we kill the red army seems to have an inexhaustible supply of new recruits what do you think will happen the nazis will never admit defeat of course so more people will die millions more just because theyre too proud to yield insanity insanity he drifted off to sleep you had to be sick or crazy to voice such thoughts but carla believed that more and more people were thinking that way despite relentless government propaganda it was becoming clear that hitler was losing the war there had been no police investigation of the death of joachim koch it had been reported in the newspaper as a road accident carla had got over the initial shock but every now and again the realization hit her that she had killed a man and she would relive his death in her imagination it made her shake and she had to sit down this had happened only once when she was on duty fortunately and she had passed that off as a faint due to hunger highly plausible in wartime berlin her mother was worse strange that maud had loved joachim weak and foolish as he was but there was no explaining love carla herself had completely misjudged werner franck thinking he was strong and brave only to learn that he was selfish and weak she talked to beck a lot before he was discharged probing to find out what kind of man he was once recovered he never again spoke indiscreetly about the war she learned that he was a career soldier his wife was dead and his married daughter lived in buenos aires his father had been a berlin city councillor he did not say for which party so clearly it was not the nazis or any of their allies he never said anything bad about hitler but he never said anything good either nor did he speak disparagingly of jews or communists these days that in itself was close to insubordination his lung would heal but he would never again be strong enough for active service and he told her he was being posted to the general staff he could become a diamond mine of vital secrets she would be risking her life if she tried to recruit him but she had to try she knew he would not remember their first conversation you were very candid carla told him in a low voice there was no one nearby you said we were losing the war his eyes flashed fear he was no longer a woozy patient in a hospital gown with stubble on his cheeks he was washed and shaved sitting upright in darkblue pyjamas buttoned to the throat i suppose youre going to report me to the gestapo he said i dont think a man should be held to account for what he says when hes sick and raving you werent raving she said you were very clear but im not going to report you to anyone no because you are right he was surprised now i should report you if you do ill say that you insulted hitler in your delirium and when i threatened to report it you made up a story about me in selfdefence if i denounce you youll denounce me he said stalemate but youre not going to denounce me she said i know that because i know you ive nursed you youre a good man you joined the army for love of your country but you hate the war and you hate the nazis she was per cent sure of this its very dangerous to talk like that i know so this isnt just a casual conversation correct you said that millions of people are going to die just because the nazis are too proud to surrender did i you can help save some of those millions how carla paused this was where she put her life on the line any information you have i can pass it to the appropriate quarters she held her breath if she was wrong about beck she was dead she read amazement in his look he could hardly imagine that this briskly efficient young nurse was a spy but he believed her she could see that he said i think i understand you she handed him a green hospital file folder empty he took it whats this for he said youre a soldier you understand camouflage he nodded youre risking your life he said and she saw something like admiration in his eyes so are you now yes said colonel beck but im used to it ii early in the morning thomas macke took young werner franck to the plötzensee prison in the western suburb of charlottenburg you should see this he said then you can tell general dorn how effective we are he parked in the königsdamm and led werner to the rear of the main prison they entered a room twentyfive feet long and about half as wide waiting there was a man dressed in a tailcoat a top hat and white gloves werner frowned at the peculiar costume this is herr reichhart said macke the executioner werner swallowed so were going to witness an execution yes with a casual air that might have been faked werner said why the fancy dress outfit macke shrugged tradition a black curtain divided the room in two macke drew it back to show eight hooks attached to an iron girder that ran across the ceiling werner said for hanging macke nodded there was also a wooden table with straps for holding someone down at one end of the table was a high device of distinctive shape on the floor was a heavy basket the young lieutenant was pale a guillotine he said exactly said macke he looked at his watch we shant be kept waiting long more men filed into the room several nodded in a familiar way to macke speaking quietly into werners ear macke said regulations demand that the judges the court officers the prison governor and the chaplain all attend werner swallowed he was not liking this macke could see he was not meant to mackes motive in bringing him here had nothing to do with impressing general dorn macke was worried about werner there was something about him that did not ring true werner worked for dorn that was not in question he had accompanied dorn on a visit to gestapo headquarters and subsequently dorn had written a note saying that the berlin counterespionage effort was most impressive and mentioning macke by name for weeks afterwards macke had walked around in a miasma of warm pride but macke could not forget werners behaviour on that evening nearly a year ago now when they had almost caught a spy in a disused fur coat factory near the east station werner had panicked or had he accidentally or otherwise he had given the pianist enough warning to get away macke could not shake the suspicion that the panic had been an act and werner had in fact been coolly and deliberately sounding the alarm macke did not quite have the nerve to arrest and torture werner it could be done of course but dorn might well kick up a fuss and then macke would be questioned his boss superintendent kringelein who did not much like him would ask what hard evidence he had against werner and he had none but this ought to reveal the truth the door opened again and two prison guards entered on either side of a young woman called lili markgraf he heard werner gasp whats the matter macke asked werner said you didnt tell me it was going to be a girl do you know her no lili was twentytwo macke knew though she looked younger her fair hair had been cut this morning and it was now as short as a mans she was limping and walked bent over as if she had an abdominal injury she wore a plain blue dress of heavy cotton with no collar just a round neckline her eyes were red with crying the guards held her arms firmly not taking any chances this woman was denounced by a relative who found a code book hidden in her room macke said the fivedigit russian code why is she walking like that the effects of interrogation but we didnt get anything from her werners face was impassive what a shame he said she might have led us to other spies macke saw no sign that he was faking she knew her associate only as heinrich no last name and he may have used a pseudonym anyway i find we rarely profit by arresting women they dont know enough but at least you have her code book for what its worth they change the key word regularly so we still face a challenge in decrypting their signals pity one of the men cleared his throat and spoke loudly enough for everyone to hear he said he was the president of the court then read out the death sentence the guards walked lili to the wooden table they gave her the chance of lying on it voluntarily but she took a step backwards so they picked her up forcibly she did not struggle they laid her face down and strapped her in the chaplain began a prayer lili began to plead no no she said without raising her voice no please let me go let me go she spoke coherently as if she were merely asking someone for a favour the man in the top hat looked at the president who shook his head and said not yet the prayer must be finished lilis voice rose in pitch and urgency i dont want to die im afraid to die dont do this to me please the executioner looked again at the court president this time the president just ignored him macke studied werner he looked sick but so did everybody else in the room as a test this was not really working werners reaction showed that he was sensitive not that he was a traitor macke might have to think of something else lili began to scream even macke felt impatient the pastor hurried through the rest of the prayer when he said amen she stopped screaming as if she knew it was all over the president gave the nod the executioner moved a lever and the weighted blade fell it made a whispering sound as it sliced through lilis pale neck her shortcropped head fell forward and there was a gush of blood the head hit the basket with a loud thump that seemed to resound in the room absurdly macke wondered if the head felt any pain iii carla bumped into colonel beck in the hospital corridor he was in uniform she looked at him in sudden fear ever since he had been discharged she had lived every day in fear that he had betrayed her and the gestapo were on their way but he smiled and said i came back for a checkup with dr ernst was that all had he forgotten their conversation was he pretending to have forgotten it was there a black gestapo mercedes waiting outside beck was carrying a green hospital file folder a cancer specialist in a white coat approached as he went by carla said brightly to beck how are things im as fit as im ever going to be ill never lead a battalion into battle again but aside from athletics i can lead a normal life im glad to hear that people kept walking by carla feared beck would never get the chance to say anything to her privately but he remained unruffled id just like to thank you for your kindness and professionalism youre welcome goodbye sister goodbye colonel when beck left carla was holding the file folder she walked briskly to the nurses cloakroom it was empty she stood with her heel firmly wedged against the door so no one could come in inside the folder was a large envelope made of the cheap buffcoloured paper used in offices everywhere carla opened the envelope it contained several typewritten sheets she looked at the first without removing it from the envelope it was headed operational order no code zitadelle it was the battle plan for the summer offensive on the eastern front her heart raced this was gold dust she had to pass the envelope to frieda unfortunately frieda was not working at the hospital today it was her day off carla considered leaving the hospital right away in the middle of her shift and going to friedas house but she swiftly rejected that idea better to behave normally not to attract attention she slipped the envelope into the shoulder bag hanging on her coat hook she covered it with the blueandgold silk scarf that she always carried for hiding things she stood still for a few moments letting her breathing return to normal then she went back to the ward she worked the rest of her shift as best she could then she put on her coat left the hospital and walked to the station passing a bomb site she saw graffiti on the remains of the building a defiant patriot had written our walls might break but not our hearts but someone else had ironically quoted hitlers election slogan give me four years and you will not recognize germany she bought a ticket to the zoo on the train she felt like an alien all the other passengers were loyal germans and she was the one with secrets in her bag to betray to moscow she did not like the feeling no one looked at her but that only made her think they were all deliberately avoiding her eye she could hardly wait to hand over the envelope to frieda the zoo station was on the edge of the tiergarten the trees were dwarfed now by a huge flak tower one of three in berlin this square concrete block was more than feet high at the corners of the roof were four giant mm antiaircraft guns weighing tons each the raw concrete was painted green in a hopelessly optimistic attempt to make the monstrosity less of an eyesore in the park ugly though it was berliners loved it when the bombs were falling its thunder reassured them that someone was shooting back still in a state of high tension carla walked from the station to friedas house it was midafternoon so the franck parents would probably be out ludi at his factory and monika seeing a friend possibly carlas mother werners motorcycle was parked on the drive the manservant opened the door miss frieda is out but she wont be long he said she went to kadewe to buy gloves mr werner is in bed with a heavy cold ill wait for frieda in her room as usual carla took off her coat and went upstairs still carrying her bag in friedas room she kicked off her shoes and lay on the bed to read the battle plan for operation zitadelle she was as stressed as an overwound clock but she would feel better when she had given the purloined document to someone else from the next room she heard the sound of sobbing she was surprised that was werners room carla found it hard to imagine the suave playboy in tears but the sound definitely came from a man and he seemed to be trying and failing to suppress his grief against her will carla felt pity she told herself that some feisty woman had thrown werner over probably for very good reasons but she could not help responding to the real distress she was hearing she got off the bed put the battle plan back in her bag and stepped outside she listened at werners door she could hear it even more clearly she was too softhearted to ignore it she opened the door and went in werner was sitting on the edge of the bed head in hands when he heard the door he looked up startled his face was red with emotion and wet with tears his tie was pulled down and his collar undone he looked at carla with misery in his eyes he was bowled over devastated and too wretched to care who knew it carla could not pretend to be heartless what is it she said i cant do this any more he said she closed the door behind her what happened they cut off lili markgrafs head and i had to watch carla stared openmouthed what on earth are you talking about she was twentytwo he took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his face youre already in danger but if i tell you this it will be a lot worse her mind was full of amazing surmises i think i can guess but tell me she said he nodded youll figure it out soon anyway lili helped heinrich broadcast to moscow its much quicker if someone reads you the code groups and the faster you go the less likely you are to be caught but lilis cousin stayed at the apartment for a few days and found her code books nazi bitch his words confirmed her astonishing suspicions you know about the spying he looked at her with an ironic smile im in charge of it good god thats why i had to drop the whole business of the murdered children moscow ordered me to and they were right if id lost my job at the air ministry i would have had no access to secret papers nor to other people who could bring me secrets she needed to sit down she perched on the edge of the bed beside him why didnt you tell me we work on the assumption that everyone talks under torture knowing nothing you cant betray others poor lili was tortured but she only knew volodya whos back in moscow now and heinrich and she never knew heinrichs second name or anything else about him carla was chilled to the bone everyone talks under torture werner finished im sorry ive told you but after seeing me like this you were on the point of guessing it all anyway so ive completely misjudged you not your fault i deliberately misled you i feel a fool just the same ive despised you for two years all the while i was desperate to explain to you she put her arm around him he took her other hand and kissed it can you forgive me she was not sure how she felt but she did not want to reject him when he was so down so she said yes of course poor lili he said his voice fell to a whisper she had been so badly beaten she could hardly walk to the guillotine yet she begged for life right up to the end how come you were there ive befriended a gestapo man inspector thomas macke he took me macke i remember him he arrested my father she vividly recalled a roundfaced man with a small black moustache and she experienced again her rage at the arrogant power macke had to take her father away and her grief when he died of the injuries he suffered at mackes hands i think he suspects me and taking me to the execution was a test perhaps he thought i might lose my selfcontrol and try to intervene anyway i think i passed the test but if you were arrested werner nodded everyone talks under torture and you know everything every agent every code the only thing i dont know is where they broadcast from i leave it up to them to pick the locations and they dont tell me they held hands in silence after a while carla said i came to give it to frieda but i might as well give it to you give what the battle plan for operation zitadelle werner was electrified but ive been trying to put my hands on that for weeks where did you get it from an officer on the general staff perhaps i shouldnt say his name quite right dont tell me but is it authentic youd better take a look she went to friedas room and returned with the buff envelope it had never occurred to her that the document might not be genuine it looks all right to me but what do i know he took out the typewritten sheets after a minute he said this is the real thing fantastic im so glad he stood up i have to take this to heinrich right away we must get this encrypted and broadcast tonight carla felt disappointed that their moment of intimacy was over so soon though she could not have said what she had been expecting she followed him through the door she picked up her bag from friedas room and went downstairs with his hand on the front door werner said im so glad were friends again me too do you think well be able to forget this period of estrangement she did not know what he was trying to say did he want to be her lover again or was he telling her that was out of the question i think we can put it behind us she said neutrally good he bent and kissed her lips very quickly then he opened the door they left the house together and he climbed on his motorcycle carla walked down the driveway to the street and headed for the station a moment later werner drove past her with a honk and a wave now that she was alone she could begin to think about his revelation how did she feel for two years she had hated him but in that time she had not had a serious boyfriend had she remained in love with him all along at a minimum she had retained in her heart of hearts a fondness for him despite everything today when she heard him in such distress her hostility had melted away now she felt a glow of affection did she love him still she did not know iv macke sat in the rear seat of the black mercedes with werner beside him around mackes neck was a bag like a school satchel except that he wore it in front instead of behind it was small enough to be covered by a buttoned overcoat a thin wire ran from the bag to a small earphone its the latest thing macke said as you get closer to the broadcaster the sound gets louder werner said more discreet than a van with a big aerial on its roof we have to use both the van to discover the general area and this to pinpoint the exact location macke was in trouble operation zitadelle had been a catastrophe even before the offensive opened the red army had attacked the airfields where the luftwaffe were assembling zitadelle had been called off after a week but even that was too late to prevent irreparable damage to the german army germanys leaders were always quick to blame jewishbolshevik conspirators whenever things went wrong but in this case they were right the red army had appeared to know the entire battle plan in advance and that according to superintendent kringelein was thomas mackes fault he was head of counterespionage for the city of berlin his career was on the line he faced dismissal and worse his only hope now was a tremendous coup a massive operation to round up the spies who were undermining the german war effort so tonight he had set a trap for werner franck if franck turned out to be innocent he did not know what he would do in the front seat of the car a walkietalkie crackled mackes pulse quickened the driver picked up the handset wagner here he started the engine were on our way he said over and out it had started macke asked him where are we headed kreuzberg it was a densely populated lowrent neighbourhood south of the city centre as they pulled away the air raid siren sounded that was an unwelcome complication macke looked out of the window the searchlights came on waving like giant wands macke supposed they must find planes sometimes but he had never seen it happen when the sirens ceased their howling he could hear the thunder of approaching bombers in the early years of the war a british bombing mission had consisted of a few dozen aircraft which was bad enough but now they were sending hundreds at a time the noise was terrifying even before they dropped their bombs werner said i suppose wed better call off our mission tonight hell no said macke the roar of the planes grew flares and small incendiary bombs began to fall as the car approached kreuzberg the neighbourhood was a typical target for the rafs current strategy of killing as many civilian factory workers as possible with staggering hypocrisy churchill and attlee were claiming they attacked only military targets and civilian casualties were a regrettable side effect berliners knew better wagner drove as fast as he could along streets lit fitfully by flames there were no people around apart from air raid officials everyone else was legally obliged to take shelter the only other vehicles were ambulances fire engines and police cars macke covertly studied werner the boy was edgy never quite still staring out of the window anxiously tapping his foot in unconscious tension macke had not confided his suspicions to anyone but his immediate team it was going to be difficult for him if he had to admit that he had demonstrated gestapo operations to someone who he now thought was a spy he could end up under interrogation in his own basement torture chamber he was not going to do it until he was sure the only way he might get away with it would be if at the same time he could present his superiors with a captured spy but then if his suspicion turned out to be true he would arrest not just werner but his family and friends and announce the destruction of a massive spy ring that would transform the picture he might even be promoted as the raid progressed the type of bombs changed and macke heard the profound thudding sound of high explosive once the target was illuminated the raf liked to drop a mixture of large oil bombs to start fires and high explosive to ventilate the flames and hamper the emergency services it was cruel but macke knew that the luftwaffes bombing pattern was similar the sound in mackes earphone started up as they drove cautiously along a street of fivestorey tenements the area was taking a terrific pounding and several buildings were newly demolished werner said shakily were in the middle of the target area for christs sake macke did not care tonight was already life or death to him all the better he said the pianist will imagine he doesnt need to worry about the gestapo in the middle of an air raid wagner stopped the car next to a burning church and pointed along a side street down there he said macke and werner jumped out macke walked quickly along the street with werner beside him and wagner behind werner said are you sure its a spy could it be anything else broadcasting a radio signal macke said what else could it be macke could still hear his earphone but only just for the air raid was cacophonous the planes the bombs the antiaircraft guns the crash of falling buildings and the roar of huge fires they passed a stable where horses were neighing in terror the signal growing ever stronger werner was glancing from side to side anxiously if he was a spy he would now be afraid that one of his colleagues was about to be arrested by the gestapo and wondering what the hell he could do about it would he repeat the trick he used last time or think of some new way of giving a warning if he was not a spy this whole farce was a waste of time macke took out the earpiece and handed it to werner listen he said continuing to walk werner nodded getting stronger he said the look in his eyes was almost frantic he handed the earpiece back i believe ive got you macke thought triumphantly there was a thunderous crash as a bomb landed in a building they had just passed they turned to see flames already licking up beyond the smashed windows of a bakery wagner said christ that was close they came to a school a low brick building in an asphalt yard in there i think said macke the three men walked up a short flight of stone steps to the entrance the door was not locked they went in they were at one end of a broad corridor at its far end was a large door that probably led to the school hall straight ahead said macke he drew his gun a mm luger pistol werner was not armed there was a crash a thud and the roar of an explosion all terrifyingly close all the windows in the corridor smashed and shards of glass rained on the tiled floor a bomb must have landed in the playground werner shouted clear out everyone the building is about to collapse there was no danger of the building collapsing macke could see this was werners ruse for giving the alarm to the pianist werner broke into a run but instead of heading back the way they had come he went on down the corridor towards the hall to warn his friends macke thought wagner drew his gun but macke said no dont shoot werner reached the end of the corridor and flung open the door to the hall run everyone he yelled then he fell silent and stood still inside the hall mackes colleague mann the electrical engineer was tapping out nonsense on a suitcase radio beside him stood schneider and richter both holding drawn guns macke smiled triumphantly werner had fallen straight into his trap wagner walked forward and put his gun to werners head macke said youre under arrest you subhuman bolshevik werner acted fast he jerked his head away from wagners gun seized wagners arm and pulled him into the hall for a moment wagner shielded werner from the guns in the hall then he thrust wagner away from him causing wagner to stumble and fall in the next moment he stepped out of the hall and slammed the door for a few seconds it was just macke and werner in the corridor werner walked towards macke macke pointed his luger stop or ill shoot no you wont werner came closer you need to interrogate me and find out who the others are macke pointed his gun at werners legs i can interrogate you with a bullet in your knee he said and he fired the shot missed werner lunged and knocked mackes gun hand aside macke dropped the weapon as he stooped to retrieve it werner ran past macke picked up the gun werner reached the school door macke took careful aim at his legs and fired his first three shots missed and werner went through the door macke fired one more shot through the stillopen door and werner cried out and fell down macke ran along the corridor behind him he heard the others coming out of the school hall then the roof opened with a crash there was another noise like a thud and liquid fire splashed like a fountain macke screamed in terror then in agony as his clothes caught alight he fell to the ground then there was silence then darkness v the doctors were triaging patients in the hospital lobby those merely bruised and cut were sent into the outpatients waiting area where the most junior nurses cleaned their cuts and consoled them with aspirins the serious cases were given emergency treatment right there in the lobby then sent to specialists upstairs the dead were taken into the yard and laid on the cold ground until someone claimed them dr ernst examined a screaming burn victim and prescribed morphine then get his clothes off and put some gel on those burns he said and moved on to the next one carla loaded a syringe while frieda cut the patients blackened clothes away he had severe burns all down his right side but the left was not so bad carla found an intact patch of skin and flesh on his left thigh she was about to inject the patient when she looked at his face and froze she knew that fat round countenance with the moustache like a dirt mark under the nose two years ago he had come into the hall of her house and arrested her father next time she saw her father he had been dying this was inspector thomas macke of the gestapo you killed my father she thought now i can kill you it would be simple she would give him four times the maximum dose of morphine no one would notice especially on a night like tonight he would fall unconscious immediately and die in a few minutes a doctor who was almost asleep on his feet would assume his heart had failed no one would doubt the diagnosis and no one would ask sceptical questions he would be one of thousands killed in a massive air raid rest in peace she knew that werner feared macke might be on to him any day now werner could be arrested everyone talks under torture werner would give away frieda and heinrich and others and carla she could save them all now in a minute but she hesitated she asked herself why macke was a torturer and a killer he deserved to die a thousand deaths carla had killed joachim or at least helped to kill him but joachim had been kicking carlas mother to death when she hit him over the head with a soup cauldron this was different macke was a patient carla was not very religious but she did believe that some things were sacred she was a nurse and patients put their trust in her she knew that macke would torture and kill her without hesitation but she was not like macke she was not that kind this was nothing to do with him it was about her if she killed a patient she felt she would have to leave the profession and never again dare to care for sick people she would be like a banker who steals money or a politician who takes bribes or a priest who feels up the young girls who come to him for first communion classes she would have betrayed herself frieda said what are you waiting for i cant gel him until he calms down carla stuck the needle in thomas macke and he stopped screaming frieda started to put gel on his burned skin this ones only concussed dr ernst was saying of another patient but hes got a bullet in his backside he raised his voice to talk to the patient how did you get shot bullets are about the only things the raf isnt throwing at us tonight carla turned to look the patient was lying on his front his trousers had been cut off showing his rear he had white skin and fine fair hair on the small of his back he was woozy but he muttered something ernst said policemans gun went off by accident did you say the patient spoke more clearly yes im going to take the bullet out it will hurt but were short of morphine and there are worse cases than you go ahead carla swabbed the wound ernst picked up a long narrow pair of forceps bite the pillow he said he inserted the forceps into the wound a muffled cry of pain came from the patient dr ernst said try not to tense your muscles it makes it worse carla thought that was a stupid thing to say no one could relax their muscles while a wound was being probed the patient roared ah shit ive got it dr ernst said try to keep still the patient lay still and ernst drew the slug out and dropped it into a tray carla wiped the blood from the hole and slapped a dressing on the wound the patient rolled over no carla said you must lie on your she stopped the patient was werner carla he said its me she said happily putting a bandage on your bum i love you he said she threw her arms around him in the most unprofessional way possible and said oh my dearest i love you too vi thomas macke came around slowly at first he was in a dreamlike state then he became more aware and realized he was in a hospital and drugged he knew why too his skin hurt intensely especially down his left side he was able to figure out that the drugs must be reducing the pain but not completely eliminating it slowly he remembered how he had come here he had been bombed he would be dead if he had not been running away from the blast chasing a fugitive those behind him were certainly dead mann schneider richter and young wagner his whole team but he had caught werner or had he he had shot werner and werner had fallen then the bomb had dropped macke had survived so werner might have too macke was now the only man living who knew that werner was a spy he had to speak to his boss superintendent kringelein he tried to sit upright but found he did not have the strength to move he decided to call a nurse but when he opened his mouth no sound came out the effort exhausted him and he went back to sleep the next time he awoke he sensed it was night the place was quiet no one moving he opened his eyes to see a face hovering over him it was werner youre leaving here now werner said macke tried to call for help but found he could not speak youre going to a new place werner said you wont be a torturer any more in fact youll be the one who gets tortured there macke opened his mouth to scream a pillow descended on his face it was pressed firmly over his mouth and nose he found he could not breathe he tried to struggle but there was no strength in his limbs he tried to gasp for air but there was no air he started to panic he managed to move his head from side to side but the pillow was pressed down more firmly at last he made a noise but it was only a whimper in his throat the universe became a disc of light that shrank slowly until it was a pinpoint then it went out iii will you marry me said volodya peshkov and held his breath no said zoya vorotsyntsev but thank you she was remarkably matteroffact about everything but this was unusually brisk even for her they were in bed at the lavish hotel moskva and they had just made love zoya had come twice her preferred type of sex was cunnilingus she liked to recline on a pile of pillows while he knelt worshipfully between her legs he was a willing acolyte and she returned the favour with enthusiasm they had been a couple for more than a year and everything seemed to be going wonderfully well her refusal baffled him he said do you love me yes i adore you thank you for loving me enough to propose marriage that was a bit better so why wont you accept i dont want to bring children into a world at war she said okay i can understand that ask me again when weve won by then i may not want to marry you if thats how inconstant you are its a good thing i refused you today sorry for a moment there i forgot that you dont understand teasing i have to pee she got off the bed and walked naked across the hotel room volodya could hardly believe he was allowed to see this she had the body of a fashion model or a movie star her skin was milkwhite and her hair pale blonde all of it she sat on the toilet without closing the bathroom door and he listened to her peeing her lack of modesty was a perpetual delight he was supposed to be working the moscow intelligence community was thrown into disarray every time allied leaders visited and volodyas normal routine had been disrupted again for the foreign ministers conference that had opened on october the visitors were the american secretary of state cordell hull and the british foreign secretary anthony eden they had a harebrained scheme for a fourpower pact including china stalin thought it was all nonsense and did not understand why they were wasting time on it the american hull was seventytwo years old and coughing blood his doctor had come to moscow with him but he was no less forceful for that and he was insistent on the pact there was so much to do during the conference that the nkvd the secret police were forced to cooperate with their hated rivals in red army intelligence volodyas outfit microphones had to be concealed in hotel rooms there was one in here only volodya had disconnected it the visiting ministers and all their aides had to be kept under minutebyminute surveillance their luggage had to be clandestinely opened and searched their phone calls had to be taperecorded and transcribed and translated into russian and read and summarized most of the people they met including waiters and chambermaids were nkvd agents but anyone else they happened to speak to in the hotel lobby or on the street had to be checked out perhaps arrested and imprisoned and interrogated under torture it was a lot of work volodya was riding high his spies in berlin were producing remarkable intelligence they had given him the battle plan for the germans main summer offensive zitadelle and the red army had inflicted a tremendous defeat zoya was happy too the soviet union had resumed nuclear research and zoya was part of the team trying to design a nuclear bomb they were a long way behind the west because of the delay caused by stalins scepticism but in compensation they were getting invaluable help from communist spies in england and america including volodyas old school friend willi frunze zoya came back to bed volodya said when we first met you didnt seem to like me much i didnt like men she replied i still dont most of them are drunks and bullies and fools it took me a while to figure out that you were different thanks i think he said but are men really so bad look around you she said look at our country he reached over her and turned on the bedside radio even though he had disconnected the listening device behind the headboard you couldnt be too careful when the radio had warmed up a military band played a march satisfied that he could not be overheard volodya said youre thinking of stalin and beria but they wont always be around do you know how my father fell from favour she said no my parents never mentioned it theres a reason for that go on according to my mother there was an election at my fathers factory for a deputy to attend the moscow soviet a menshevik candidate stood against the bolshevik and my father went to a meeting to hear him speak he did not support the menshevik nor vote for him but everyone who went to that meeting was sacked and a few weeks later my father was arrested and taken to the lubyanka she meant the nkvd headquarters and prison in lubyanka square she went on my mother went to your father and begged him to help he immediately went with her to the lubyanka they saved my father but they saw twelve other workers shot thats terrible volodya said but it was stalin no this was stalin was just a red army commander fighting in the sovietpolish war lenin was leader this happened under lenin yes so you see its not just stalin and beria volodyas view of communist history was badly shaken what is it then the door opened volodya reached for his gun in the bedsidetable drawer but the person who came in was a girl wearing a fur coat and as far as he could see nothing else sorry volodya she said i didnt know you had company zoya said who the fuck is she volodya said natasha how did you open my door you gave me a pass key it opens every door in the hotel well you might have knocked sorry i just came to tell you the bad news what i went into woody dewars room just as you told me but i didnt succeed what did you do this natasha opened her coat to show her naked body she had a voluptuous figure and a luxuriant bush of dark pubic hair all right i get the picture close your coat said volodya what did he say she switched to english he just said no i said what do you mean no he said its the opposite of yes then he just held the door wide open until i went out bugger said volodya ill have to think of something else ii chuck dewar knew there was going to be trouble when captain vandermeier came into the enemy land section in the middle of the afternoon redfaced from a beery lunch the intelligence unit at pearl harbor had expanded formerly called station hypo it now had the grand title of joint intelligence center pacific ocean area or jicpoa vandermeier had a marine sergeant in tow hey you two powder puffs vandermeier said you got a customer complaint here the operation had grown everyone began to specialize and chuck and eddie had become experts at mapping the territory where american forces were about to land as they fought their way island by island across the pacific vandermeier said this is sergeant donegan the marine was very tall and looked as hard as a rifle chuck guessed that the sexually troubled vandermeier was smitten chuck stood up good to meet you sergeant im chief petty officer dewar chuck and eddie had both been promoted as thousands of conscripts poured into the us military there was a shortage of officers and prewar enlisted men who knew the ropes rose fast chuck and eddie were now permitted to live off base they had rented a small apartment together chuck put out his hand but donegan did not shake it chuck sat down again he slightly outranked a sergeant and he was not going to be polite to one who was rude something i can do for you captain vandermeier there were many ways a captain could torment petty officers in the navy and vandermeier knew them all he adjusted rotas so that chuck and eddie never had the same day off he marked their reports adequate knowing full well that anything less than excellent was in fact a black mark he sent confusing messages to the pay office so that chuck and eddie were paid late or got less than they should have and had to spend hours straightening things out he was a royal pain and now he had thought up some new mischief donegan pulled from his pocket a grubby sheet of paper and unfolded it is this your work he said aggressively chuck took the paper it was a map of new georgia a group in the solomon islands let me check he said it was his work and he knew it but he was playing for time he went to a filing cabinet and pulled open a drawer he took out the file for new georgia and shut the drawer with his knee he returned to his desk sat down and opened the file it contained a duplicate of donegans map yes chuck said thats my work well im here to tell you its shit said donegan is it look right here you show the jungle coming down to the sea in fact theres a beach a quarter of a mile wide im sorry to hear that sorry donegan had drunk about the same amount of beer as vandermeier and he was spoiling for a fight fifty of my men died on that beach vandermeier belched and said how could you make a mistake like that dewar chuck was shaken if he was responsible for an error that had killed fifty men he deserved to be shouted at this is what we had to work on he said the file contained an inaccurate map of the islands that might have been victorian and a more recent naval chart that showed sea depths but almost no terrain features there were no onthespot reports and no wireless decrypts the only other item in the file was a blurred blackandwhite aerial reconnaissance photograph putting his finger on the relevant spot in the photo chuck said it sure looks as if the trees come all the way to the waterline is there a tide if not the sand might have been covered with algae when the photograph was taken algae can bloom suddenly and die off just as fast donegan said you wouldnt be so goddamn casual about it if you had to fight over the terrain maybe that was true chuck thought donegan was aggressive and rude and he was being egged on by the malicious vandermeier but that did not mean he was wrong vandermeier said yeah dewar maybe you and your nancyboy friend should go with the marines on their next assault see how your maps are used in action chuck was trying to think of a smart retort when it occurred to him to take the suggestion seriously maybe he ought to see some action it was easy to be blasé behind a desk donegans complaint deserved to be taken seriously on the other hand it would mean risking his life chuck looked vandermeier in the eye that sounds like a good idea captain he said id like to volunteer for that duty donegan looked startled as if he was beginning to think he might have misjudged the situation eddie spoke for the first time so would i ill go too good said vandermeier youll come back wiser or not at all iii volodya could not get woody dewar drunk in the bar of the hotel moskva he thrust a glass of vodka in front of the young american and said in schoolboy english youll like this its the very best thank you very much said woody i appreciate it and he left the glass untouched woody was tall and gangly and seemed straightforward to the point of naivety which was why volodya had targeted him speaking through the interpreter woody said is peshkov a common russian name not especially volodya replied in russian im from buffalo where there is a wellknown businessman called lev peshkov i wonder if youre related volodya was startled his fathers brother was called lev peshkov and had gone to buffalo before the first world war but caution made him prevaricate i must ask my father he said i was at harvard with lev peshkovs son greg he could be your cousin possibly volodya glanced nervously at the police spies around the table woody did not understand that any connection with someone in america could bring down suspicion on a soviet citizen you know woody in this country its considered an insult to refuse to drink woody smiled pleasantly not in america he said volodya picked up his own glass and looked around the table at the assorted secret policemen pretending to be civil servants and diplomats a toast he said to friendship between the united states and the soviet union the others raised their glasses high woody did the same friendship they all echoed everyone drank except woody who put his glass down untasted volodya began to suspect that he was not as naive as he seemed woody leaned across the table volodya you need to understand that i dont know any secrets im too junior so am i said volodya it was far from the truth woody said what im trying to explain is that you can just ask me questions if i know the answers ill tell you i can do that because anything i know cant possibly be secret so you dont need to get me drunk or send prostitutes to my room you can just ask me it was some kind of trick volodya decided no one could be so innocent but he decided to humour woody why not all right he said i need to know what youre after not you personally of course your delegation and secretary hull and president roosevelt what do you want from this conference we want you to back the fourpower pact it was the standard answer but volodya decided to persist this is what we dont understand he was being candid now perhaps more than he should have but instinct was telling him to take the risk of opening up a little who cares about a pact with china we need to defeat the nazis in europe we want you to help us do that and we will so you say but you said you would invade europe this summer well we did invade italy its not enough france next year weve promised that so why do you need the pact well woody paused collecting his thoughts we have to show the american people how its in their interests to invade europe why why what why do you need to explain this to the public roosevelt is president isnt he he should just do it next year is election year he wants to get reelected so american people wont vote for him if they think hes involved them unnecessarily in the war in europe so he wants to put it to them as part of his overall plan for world peace if we have the fourpower pact showing that were serious about the united nations organization then american voters are more likely to accept that the invasion of france is a step on the road to a more peaceful world this is amazing volodya said hes the president yet he has to make excuses all the time for what he does something like that woody said we call it democracy volodya had a sneaking suspicion that this incredible story might actually be the truth so the pact is necessary to persuade american voters to support the invasion of europe exactly then why do we need china stalin was particularly scornful of the allies insistence that china should be included in the pact china is a weak ally so ignore china if the chinese are left out they will become discouraged and may fight less enthusiastically against the japanese so so we will have to bolster our forces in the pacific theatre and that will take away from our strength in europe that alarmed volodya the soviet union did not want allied forces diverted from europe to the pacific so you are making a friendly gesture to china simply in order to conserve more forces for the invasion of europe yes you make it seem simple it is said woody iv in the early hours of the morning on november chuck and eddie ate a steak breakfast with the us marine rd division just off the south sea island of bougainville the island was about miles long it had two japanese naval air bases one in the north and one in the south the marines were getting ready to land halfway along the lightly defended west coast their object was to establish a beachhead and win enough territory to build an airstrip from which to launch attacks on the japanese bases chuck was on deck at twentysix minutes past seven when marines in helmets and backpacks began to swarm down the rope nets hanging over the sides of the ship and jump into highsided landing craft with them were a small number of war dogs dobermann pinschers that made tireless sentries as the boats approached land chuck could already see a flaw in the map he had prepared tall waves crashed on to a steeply sloping beach as he watched a boat turned sideways to the waves and capsized the marines swam for shore we have to show surf conditions chuck said to eddie who was standing beside him on the deck how do we find them out reconnaissance aircraft will have to fly low enough for whitecaps to register on their photographs they cant risk coming that low when there are enemy air bases so close eddie was right but there had to be a solution chuck filed it away as the first question to be considered as a result of this mission for this landing they had benefited from more information than usual as well as the normal unreliable maps and hardtodecipher aerial photographs they had a report from a reconnaissance team landed by submarine six weeks earlier the team had identified twelve beaches suitable for landing along a fourmile stretch of coast but they had not warned of the surf perhaps it was not so high that day in other respects chucks map was right so far there was a sandy beach about a hundred yards wide then a tangle of palm trees and other vegetation just beyond the brush line according to the map there should be a swamp the coast was not completely undefended chuck heard the roar of artillery fire and a shell landed in the shallows it did no harm but the gunners aim would improve the marines were galvanized with a new urgency as they leaped from the landing craft to the beach and ran for the brush line chuck was glad he had decided to come he had never been careless or slack about his maps but it was salutary to see firsthand how correct mapping could save mens lives and how the smallest errors could be deadly even before they embarked he and eddie had become a lot more demanding they asked for blurred photographs to be taken again they interrogated reconnaissance parties by phone and they cabled all over the world for better charts he was glad for another reason he was at sea which he loved he was on a ship with seven hundred young men and he relished the camaraderie the jokes the songs and the intimacy of crowded berths and shared showers its like being a straight guy in a girls boarding school he said to eddie one evening except that that never happens and this does eddie said he felt the same as chuck they loved each other but they did not mind looking at naked sailors now all seven hundred marines were getting off the ship and on to land as fast as they could the same was happening at eight other locations along this stretch of coast as soon as a landing craft emptied out it lost no time in turning around and coming back for more but the process still seemed desperately slow the japanese artillery gunner hidden somewhere in the jungle found his range at last and to chucks shock a wellaimed shell exploded in a knot of marines sending men and rifles and body parts flying through the air to litter the beach and stain the sand red chuck was staring in horror at the carnage when he heard the roar of a plane and looked up to see a japanese zero flying low following the coast the red suns painted on the wings struck fear into his heart last time he saw that sight had been at the battle of midway the zero strafed the beach marines who were in the process of disembarking from landing craft were caught defenceless some threw themselves flat in the shallows some tried to get behind the hull of the boat some ran for the jungle for a few seconds blood spurted and men fell then the plane was gone leaving the beach scattered with american dead chuck heard it open up a moment later strafing the next beach it would be back there were supposed to be us planes in attendance but he could not see any air support was never where you wanted it to be which was directly above your head when all the marines were ashore alive and dead the boats transported medics and stretcher parties to the beach then they began landing supplies ammunition drinking water food drugs and dressings on the return trip the landing craft brought the wounded back to the ship chuck and eddie as nonessential personnel went ashore with the supplies the boat skippers had got used to the swell now and their craft held a stable position with its ramp on the sand and the waves breaking on its stern while the boxes were unloaded and chuck and eddie jumped into the surf to wade to shore they reached the waterline together as they did so a machine gun opened up it seemed to be in the jungle about four hundred yards along the beach had it been there all along the gunner biding his time or had it just been moved into position from another location eddie and chuck bent double and ran for the tree line a sailor with a crate of ammunition on his shoulder gave a shout of pain and fell dropping the box then eddie cried out chuck ran on two paces before he could stop when he turned eddie was rolling on the sand clutching his knee yelling ah fuck chuck came back and knelt beside him its okay im here he shouted eddies eyes were closed but he was alive and chuck could see no wounds other than the knee he glanced up the boat that had brought them was still close to shore being unloaded he could get eddie back to the ship in minutes but the machine gun was still firing he got into a crouching position this is going to hurt he said yell as much as you like he got his right arm under eddies shoulder then slid his left under eddies thighs he took the weight and straightened up eddie screamed with pain as his smashed leg swung free hang in there buddy chuck said he turned towards the water he felt sudden unbearably sharp pains in his legs his back and finally his head in the next fraction of a second he thought he must not drop eddie a moment later he knew he was going to there was a flash of light behind his eyes that rendered him blind and then the world came to an end v on her day off carla worked at the jewish hospital dr rothmann had persuaded her he had been released from the camp no one knew why except the nazis and they did not tell anyone he had lost one eye and he walked with a limp but he was alive and capable of practising medicine the hospital was in the northern workingclass district of wedding but there was nothing proletarian about the architecture it had been built before the first world war when berlins jews had been prosperous and proud there were seven elegant buildings set in a large garden the different departments were linked by tunnels so that patients and staff could move from one to another without braving the weather it was a miracle there was still a jewish hospital very few jews were left in berlin they had been rounded up in their thousands and sent away in special trains no one knew where they had gone or what happened to them there were incredible rumours about extermination camps the few jews still in berlin could not be treated if they were sick by aryan doctors and nurses so by the tangled logic of nazi racism the hospital was allowed to remain it was mainly staffed by jews and other unfortunate people who did not count as properly aryan slavs from eastern europe people of mixed ancestry and those married to jews but there were not enough nurses so carla helped out the hospital was harassed constantly by the gestapo critically short of supplies especially drugs understaffed and almost completely without funds carla was breaking the law as she took the temperature of an elevenyearold boy whose foot had been crushed in an air raid it was also a crime for her to smuggle medicines out of her everyday hospital and bring them here but she wanted to prove if only to herself that not everyone had given in to the nazis as she finished her ward round she saw werner outside the door in his air force uniform for several days he and carla had lived in fear wondering whether anyone had survived the bombing of the school and lived to condemn werner but it was now clear they had all died and no one else knew of mackes suspicions they had got away with it again werner had recovered quickly from his bullet wound and they were lovers werner had moved into the von ulrichs large halfempty house and he slept with carla every night their parents made no objection everyone felt they could die any day and people should take what joy they could from a life of hardship and suffering but werner looked more solemn than usual as he waved to carla through the glass panel in the door to the ward she beckoned him inside and kissed him i love you she said she never tired of saying it he was always happy to say i love you too what are you doing here she said did you just want a kiss ive got bad news ive been posted to the eastern front oh no tears came to her eyes its really a miracle ive avoided it this long but general dorn cant keep me any longer half our army consists of old men and schoolboys and im a fit twentyfouryearold officer she whispered please dont die ill do my best still whispering she said but what will happen to the network you know everything who else could run it he looked at her without speaking she realized what was in his mind oh no not me youre the best person friedas a follower not a leader youve shown the ability to recruit new people and motivate them youve never been in trouble with the police and you have no record of political activity no one knows the role you played in opposing aktion t as far as the authorities are concerned you are a blameless nurse but werner im scared you dont have to do it but no one else can just then they heard a commotion the neighbouring ward was for mental patients and it was not unusual to hear shouting and even screaming but this seemed different a cultured voice was raised in anger then they heard a second voice this one with a berlin accent and the insistent bullying tone that outsiders said was typical of berliners carla stepped into the corridor and werner followed dr rothmann wearing a yellow star on his jacket was arguing with a man in ss uniform behind them the double doors to the psychiatric ward normally locked were wide open the patients were leaving two more policemen and a couple of nurses were herding a ragged line of men and women most in pyjamas some walking upright and apparently normal others shambling and mumbling as they followed one another down the staircase carla was immediately reminded of adas son kurt and werners brother axel and the socalled hospital in akelberg she did not know where these patients were going but she was quite sure they would be killed there dr rothmann was saying indignantly these people are sick they need treatment the ss officer replied theyre not sick theyre lunatics and were taking them where lunatics belong to a hospital you will be informed in due course thats not good enough carla knew she should not intervene if they found out she was not jewish she would be in deep trouble she did not look particularly aryan or otherwise with dark hair and green eyes if she kept quiet probably they would not bother her but if she protested about what the ss were doing she would be arrested and questioned and then it would come out that she was working illegally so she clamped her teeth together the officer raised his voice hurry up get those cretins in the bus rothmann persisted i must be informed where they are going they are my patients they were not really his patients he was not a psychiatrist the ss man said if youre so concerned about them you can go with them dr rothmann paled he would almost certainly be going to his death carla thought of his wife hannelore his son rudi and his daughter in england eva and she felt sick with fear the officer grinned suddenly not so concerned he jeered rothmann straightened up on the contrary he said i accept your offer i swore an oath many years ago to do all i can to help sick people im not going to break my oath now i hope to die at peace with my conscience he limped down the stairs an old woman went by wearing nothing but a robe open at the front showing her nakedness carla could not remain silent its november out there she cried they have no outdoor clothing the officer gave her a hard look theyll be all right on the bus ill get some warm clothing carla turned to werner come and help me grab blankets from anywhere the two of them ran around the emptying psychiatric ward pulling blankets off beds and out of the cupboards each carrying a pile they hurried down the stairs the garden of the hospital was frozen earth outside the main door was a grey bus its engine idling its driver smoking at the wheel carla saw that he was wearing a heavy coat plus a hat and gloves which told her that the bus was not heated a small group of gestapo and ss men stood in a knot watching the proceedings the last few patients were climbing aboard carla and werner boarded the bus and began to distribute the blankets dr rothmann was standing at the back carla he said you youll tell my hannelore how it was i have to go with the patients i have no choice of course her voice was choked i may be able to protect these people carla nodded though she did not really believe it in any event i cannot abandon them ill tell her and say that i love her carla could no longer stop the tears rothmann said tell her that was the last thing i said i love her carla nodded werner took her arm lets go they got off the bus an ss man said to werner you in the air force uniform what the hell do you think youre doing werner was so angry that carla was frightened he would start a fight but he spoke calmly giving blankets to old people who are cold he said is that against the law now you should be fighting on the eastern front im going there tomorrow how about you take care what you say if you would be kind enough to arrest me before i go you might save my life the man turned away the gears of the bus crashed and its engine note rose carla and werner turned to look at every window was a face and they were all different babbling drooling laughing hysterically distracted or distorted with spiritual distress all insane psychiatric patients being taken away by the ss the mad leading the mad the bus pulled away vi i might have liked russia if id been allowed to see it woody said to his father i feel the same i didnt even get any decent photographs they were sitting in the grand lobby of the hotel moskva near the entrance to the subway station their bags were packed and they were on their way home woody said i have to tell greg peshkov that i met a volodya peshkov though volodya was not so pleased about it i guess anyone with connections in the west might fall under suspicion you bet your socks anyway we got what we came for thats the main thing the allies are committed to the united nations organization yes said gus with satisfaction stalin took some persuading but he saw sense in the end you helped with that i think by your straighttalking to peshkov youve fought for this all your life papa i dont mind admitting that this is a pretty good moment a worrying thought crossed woodys mind youre not going to retire now are you gus laughed no weve won agreement in principle but the job has only just begun cordell hull had already left moscow but some of his aides were still here and now one of them approached the dewars woody knew him a young man called ray baker i have a message for you senator he said he seemed nervous well you just caught me in time im about to leave said gus what is it its about your son charles chuck gus went pale and said what is the message ray the young man was having trouble speaking sir its bad news hes been in a battle in the solomon islands is he wounded no sir its worse oh christ said gus and he began to cry woody had never seen his father cry im sorry sir said ray the message is that hes dead woody stood in front of the mirror in his bedroom at his parents washington apartment he was wearing the uniform of a second lieutenant in the th parachute regiment of the united states army he had had the suit made by a good washington tailor but it did not look well on him khaki made his complexion sallow and the badges and flashes on the tunic jacket just seemed untidy he could probably have avoided the draft but he had decided not to part of him wanted to continue to work with his father who was helping president roosevelt plan a new global order that would avoid any more world wars they had won a triumph in moscow but stalin was inconstant and seemed to relish creating difficulties at the tehran conference in december the soviet leader had revived the halfwayhouse idea of regional councils and roosevelt had had to talk him out of it clearly the united nations organization was going to require tireless vigilance but gus could do that without woody and woody was feeling worse and worse about letting other men fight the war for him he was looking as good as he ever would in the uniform so he went into the drawing room to show his mother rosa had a visitor a young man in navy whites and after a moment woody recognized the freckled good looks of eddie parry he was sitting on the couch with rosa holding a walking stick he got to his feet with difficulty to shake woodys hand mama had a sad face she said eddie was telling me about the day chuck died eddie sat down again and woody sat opposite id like to hear about that woody said it doesnt take long to tell eddie began we were on the beach at bougainville for about five seconds when a machine gun opened up from somewhere in the swamp we ran for cover but i got a couple of bullets in my knee chuck should have gone on to the tree line thats the drill you leave the wounded to be picked up by the medics of course chuck disobeyed that rule he stopped and came back for me eddie paused there was a cup of coffee on the small table beside him and he took a gulp he picked me up in his arms he went on darn fool made hisself a target but i guess he wanted to get me back in the landing craft those boats have high sides and theyre made of steel we would have been safe and i could have got medical attention right away on the ship but he shouldnt have done it soon as he stood upright he got hit by a spray of bullets legs back and head i think he must have died before he hit the sand anyway by the time i was able to lift my head and look at him he just wasnt there any more woody saw that his mother was controlling herself with difficulty he was afraid that if she cried he would too i lay on that beach beside his body for an hour eddie said i held his hand all the time then they brought a stretcher for me i didnt want to go i knew id never see him again he buried his face in his hands i loved him so much he said rosa put her arm around his big shoulders and hugged him he laid his head on her chest and sobbed like a child she stroked his hair there there she said there there woody realized that his mother knew what chuck and eddie were after a minute eddie began to pull himself together he looked at woody you know what this is like he said he was talking about the death of joanne yes i do woody said its the worst thing in the world but it hurts a little less every day i sure hope so are you still in hawaii yes chuck and i work in the enemy land unit used to work he swallowed chuck decided we needed to get a better feel for how our maps were used in action thats why we went to bougainville with the marines you must be doing a good job woody said we seem to be beating the japs in the pacific inch by inch eddie said he glanced at woodys uniform where are you stationed ive been at fort benning in georgia doing parachute training woody said now im on my way to london i leave tomorrow he caught his mothers eye suddenly she looked older he realized her face was lined her fiftieth birthday had passed with no big fuss however he guessed that talking about chucks death while her other son stood there in army uniform had struck her a hard blow eddie did not pick that up people say well invade france this year he said i assume thats why my training was accelerated woody said you should see some action rosa muffled a sob woody said i hope ill be as brave as my brother eddie said i hope you never find out ii greg peshkov took darkeyed margaret cowdry to an afternoon symphony concert margaret had a wide generous mouth that loved kissing but greg had something else on his mind he was following barney mchugh so was an fbi agent called bill bicks barney mchugh was a brilliant young physicist he was on leave from the us armys secret laboratory at los alamos new mexico and had brought his british wife to washington to see the sights the fbi had found out in advance that mchugh was coming to the concert and special agent bicks had managed to get greg two seats a few rows behind mchughs a concert hall with hundreds of strangers crowding together to come in and go out was the perfect location for a clandestine rendezvous and greg wanted to know what mchugh might be up to it was a pity they had met before greg had talked to mchugh in chicago on the day the nuclear pile was tested it had been a year and a half ago but mchugh might remember so greg had to make sure mchugh did not see him when greg and margaret arrived mchughs seats were empty either side were two ordinarylooking couples a middleaged man in a cheap grey chalkstripe suit and his dowdy wife on the left and two elderly ladies on the right greg hoped mchugh was going to show up if the guy was a spy greg wanted to nail him they were going to hear tchaikovskys first symphony so you like classical music said margaret chattily as the orchestra tuned up she had no idea of the real reason she had been brought here she knew that greg was working in weapons research which was secret but like almost all americans she had no inkling of the nuclear bomb i thought you only listened to jazz she said i love russian composers theyre so dramatic greg told her i expect its in my blood i was raised listening to classical my father likes to have a small orchestra at dinner parties margarets family were rich enough to make greg feel a pauper by comparison but he still had not met her parents and he suspected they would disapprove of the illegitimate son of a famous hollywood womanizer what are you looking at she said nothing the mchughs had arrived whats your perfume chichi by renoir i love it the mchughs looked happy a bright and prosperous young couple on holiday greg wondered if they were late because they had been making love in their hotel room barney mchugh sat next to the man in the grey chalk stripe greg knew it was a cheap suit by the unnatural stiffness of the padded shoulders the man did not look at the newcomers the mchughs started to do a crossword their heads leaning together intimately as they studied the newspaper barney was holding a few minutes later the conductor appeared the opening piece was by saintsaëns german and austrian composers had declined in popularity since war broke out and concertgoers were discovering alternatives there was a revival of sibelius mchugh was probably a communist greg knew this because j robert oppenheimer had told him oppenheimer a leading theoretical physicist from the university of california was director of the los alamos laboratory and scientific leader of the entire manhattan project he had strong communist ties though he insisted he had never joined the party special agent bicks had said to greg why does the army have to have all these pinkos whatever it is youre trying to achieve out there in the desert arent there enough bright young conservative scientists in america to do it no there arent greg had told him if there were we would have hired them communists were sometimes more loyal to their cause than to their country and might think it right to share the secrets of nuclear research with the soviet union this would not be like giving information to the enemy the soviets were americas allies against the nazis in fact they had done more of the fighting than all the other allies put together all the same it was dangerous information intended for moscow might find its way to berlin and anyone who thought about the postwar world for more than a minute could guess that the usa and the ussr might not always be friends the fbi thought oppenheimer was a security risk and kept trying to persuade gregs boss general groves to fire him but oppenheimer was the outstanding scientist of his generation so the general insisted on keeping him in an attempt to prove his loyalty oppenheimer had named mchugh as a possible communist and that was why greg was tailing him the fbi were sceptical oppenheimer is blowing smoke up your ass bicks had said greg said i cant believe it ive known him for a year now hes a fucking communist like his wife and his brother and his sisterinlaw hes working nineteen hours a day to build better weapons for american soldiers what kind of traitor does that greg hoped mchugh did turn out to be a spy for that would lift suspicion from oppenheimer bolster general grovess credibility and boost gregs own status too he watched mchugh constantly throughout the first half of the concert not wanting to take his eyes off him the physicist did not look at the people either side of him he seemed absorbed in the music and only moved his gaze from the stage to look lovingly at mrs mchugh who was a pale english rose had oppenheimer simply been wrong about mchugh or more subtly was oppenheimers accusation a distraction to divert suspicion away from himself bicks was watching too greg knew he was upstairs in the dress circle perhaps he had seen something in the interval greg followed the mchughs out and stood in the same line for coffee neither the dowdy couple nor the two old ladies were anywhere nearby greg felt thwarted he did not know what to conclude were his suspicions unfounded or was it simply that this visit by the mchughs was innocent as he and margaret were returning to their seats bill bicks came up beside him the agent was middleaged a little overweight and losing his hair he wore a lightgrey suit that had sweat stains under the armpits he said in a low voice you were right how do you know that guy sitting next to mchugh in a grey striped suit yeah hes nikolai yenkov a cultural attaché at the soviet embassy greg said good god margaret turned around what nothing greg said bicks moved away youve got something on your mind she said as they took their seats i dont believe you heard a single bar of the saintsaëns just thinking about work tell me its not another woman and ill forget it its not another woman in the second half he began to feel anxious he had seen no contact between mchugh and yenkov they did not speak and greg saw nothing pass from one to the other no file no envelope no roll of film the symphony came to an end and the conductor took his bows the audience began to file out gregs spy hunt was a washout in the lobby margaret went to the ladies room while greg was waiting bicks approached him nothing greg said me neither maybe its a coincidence mchugh sitting by yenkov there are no coincidences perhaps there was a snag a wrong code word say bicks shook his head they passed something we just didnt see it mrs mchugh also went to the ladies room and like greg mchugh waited nearby greg studied him from behind a pillar he had no briefcase no raincoat under which to conceal a package or a file but all the same something about him was wrong what was it then greg realized the newspaper he said what when barney came in he was carrying a newspaper they did the crossword while waiting for the show now he doesnt have it either he threw it away or he passed it to yenkov with something concealed inside yenkov and his wife have left already they may still be outside bicks and greg ran for the door bicks shoved his way through the crowd still filing out of the exits greg stayed close behind they reached the sidewalk outside and looked both ways greg could not see yenkov but bicks had sharp eyes across the street he cried the attaché and his dowdy wife were standing at the kerb and a black limousine was approaching them slowly yenkov was holding a folded newspaper greg and bicks ran across the road the limousine stopped greg was faster than bicks and reached the far sidewalk first yenkov had not noticed them unhurriedly he opened the car door then stepped back to let his wife get in greg threw himself at yenkov they both fell to the ground mrs yenkov screamed greg scrambled to his feet the chauffeur had got out of the car and was coming around it but bicks yelled fbi and held up his badge yenkov had dropped the newspaper now he reached for it but greg was faster he picked it up stepped back and opened it inside was a sheaf of papers the top one was a diagram greg recognized it immediately it showed the working of an implosion trigger for a plutonium bomb jesus christ he said this is the very latest stuff yenkov jumped into the car slammed the door and locked it from the inside the chauffeur got back in and drove away iii it was saturday night and daisys apartment in piccadilly was heaving there had to be a hundred people there she thought feeling pleased she had become the leader of a social group based on the american red cross in london every saturday she gave a party for american servicemen and invited nurses from st barts hospital to meet them raf pilots came too they drank her unlimited scotch and gin and danced to glenn miller records on her gramophone conscious that it might be the last party the men ever attended she did everything she could to make them happy except kiss them but the nurses did plenty of that daisy never drank liquor at her own parties she had too much to think about couples were always locking themselves in the toilet and having to be dragged out because the room was needed for its regular purpose if a really important general got drunk he had to be seen safely home she often ran out of ice she could not make her british staff understand how much ice a party needed for a while after she split up with boy fitzherbert her only friends had been the leckwith family lloyds mother ethel had never judged her although ethel was the height of respectability now she had made mistakes in her past and that made her more understanding daisy still went to ethels house in aldgate every wednesday evening and drank cocoa around the radio it was her favourite night of the week she had now been socially rejected twice once in buffalo and again in london and the depressing thought occurred to her that it might be her fault perhaps she did not really belong in those prissy highsociety groups with their strict rules of conduct she was a fool to be attracted to them the trouble was that she loved parties and picnics and sporting events and any gathering where people dressed up and had fun however she now knew she did not need british aristocrats or oldmoney americans to have fun she had created her own society and it was a lot more exciting than theirs some of the people who had refused to speak to her after she left boy now hinted heavily that they would like an invitation to one of her famous saturday nights and many guests came to her apartment to let their hair down after an excruciatingly grand dinner in a palatial mayfair residence tonight was the best party so far for lloyd was home on leave he was openly living with her at the flat she did not care what people thought her reputation in respectable circles was already so bad that no further damage could be done anyway the urgency of wartime love had driven many people to break the rules in similar ways domestic staff could sometimes be as rigid as duchesses about such things but all daisys employees adored her so she and lloyd did not even pretend to be occupying separate bedrooms she loved sleeping with him he was not as experienced as boy but he made up for that in enthusiasm and he was eager to learn every night was a voyage of exploration in a double bed as they looked at their guests talking and laughing drinking and smoking dancing and smooching lloyd smiled at her and said happy almost she said almost she sighed i want to have children lloyd i dont care that were not married well i do care of course but i still want a baby his face darkened you know how i feel about illegitimacy yes you explained it to me but i want some part of you to cherish if you die ill do my best to stay alive i know but if her suspicion was correct and he was working undercover in occupied territory he could be executed as german spies were executed in britain he would be gone and she would have nothing left its the same for a million women i realize that but i cant face the thought of life without you i think ill die if i could make boy divorce you i would well this is no kind of talk for a party she looked across the room what do you know i believe thats woody dewar woody was wearing a lieutenants uniform she went over and greeted him it was strange to see him again after nine years though he did not look much different just older there are thousands of american soldiers here now daisy said as they foxtrotted to pennsylvania sixfive thousand we must be about to invade france what else the top brass certainly dont share their plans with greenhorn lieutenants woody said but like you i cant think of any other reason why im here we cant leave the russians to bear the brunt of the fighting much longer when do you think it will happen offensives always begin in the summer late may or early june is everyones best guess that soon but no one knows where dover to calais is the shortest sea crossing daisy said and for that reason the german defences are concentrated around calais so maybe well try to surprise them say by landing on the south coast near marseilles perhaps then it will be over at last i doubt it once we have a bridgehead we still have to conquer france then germany theres a long road ahead oh dear woody seemed to need cheering up and daisy knew just the girl to do it isabel hernandez was a rhodes scholar doing a masters in history at st hildas college oxford she was gorgeous but the boys called her a ballbuster because she was so fiercely intellectual however woody would be oblivious to that come over here she called to isabel woody this is my friend bella shes from san francisco bella meet woody dewar from buffalo they shook hands bella was tall with thick dark hair and olive skin just like joanne rouzrokhs woody smiled at her and said what are you doing here in london daisy left them she served supper at midnight when she could get american supplies it was ham and eggs otherwise cheese sandwiches it provided a lull when people could talk a bit like the interval at the theatre she noticed that woody dewar was still with bella hernandez and they seemed to be deep in conversation she made sure everyone had what they needed then sat in a corner with lloyd ive decided what id like to do after the war if im still alive he said as well as marry you that is what im going to try for parliament daisy was thrilled lloyd thats wonderful she put her arms around his neck and kissed him its too early for congratulations ive put my name down for hoxton the constituency next to mams but the local labour party may not pick me and if they do i may not win hoxton has a strong liberal mp at the moment i want to help you she said i could be your righthand woman ill write your speeches i bet id be good at that id love you to help me then its settled the older guests left after supper but the music continued and the drink never ran out so the party became even more uninhibited woody was now slowdancing with bella daisy wondered if this was his first romance since joanne the petting got heavier and people began disappearing into the two bedrooms they could not lock the doors daisy had taken the keys out so there were sometimes several couples in the same room but no one seemed to mind daisy had once found two people in the broom cupboard fast asleep in each others arms at one oclock her husband arrived she had not invited boy but he showed up in the company of a couple of american pilots and daisy shrugged and let him in he was amiably squiffy and danced with several nurses then politely asked her was he just drunk she wondered or had he softened towards her and if so might he reconsider the divorce she consented and they did the jitterbug most of the guests had no idea they were a separated husband and wife but those who knew were amazed i read in the papers that you bought another racehorse she said making small talk lucky laddie he said cost me eight thousand guineas a record price i hope hes worth it she loved horses and she had thought they would buy and train racehorses together but he had not wanted to share that enthusiasm with his wife it had been one of the frustrations of her marriage he read her mind i disappointed you didnt i he said yes and you disappointed me that was a new thought to her after a minutes reflection she said by not turning a blind eye to your infidelities exactly he was drunk enough to be honest she saw her opportunity how long do you think we should punish one another punish he said whos punishing anyone were punishing each other by staying married we should get divorced as sensible people do perhaps youre right he said but this time on a saturday night is not the best moment to discuss it her hopes rose why dont i come and see you she said when were both fresh and sober he hesitated all right she pressed her advantage eagerly how about tomorrow morning all right ill see you after church say twelve noon all right said boy iv as woody was walking bella home through hyde park to a friends flat in south kensington she kissed him he had not done this since joanne died at first he froze he liked bella a lot she was the smartest girl he had met since joanne and the way she had clung to him while they were slowdancing had let him know he could kiss her if he wanted to all the same he had been holding back he kept thinking about joanne then bella took the initiative she opened her mouth and he tasted her tongue but that only made him think of joanne kissing him that way it was only two and a half years since she had died his brain was forming words of polite rejection when his body took over he was suddenly consumed with desire he began to kiss her back hungrily she responded eagerly to his excess of passion she took both his hands and put them on her breasts which were large and soft he groaned helplessly it was dark and he could hardly see but he realized by the halfsmothered sounds coming from the surrounding vegetation that there were numerous couples doing similar things nearby she pressed her body against his and he knew she could feel his erection he was so excited he felt he would ejaculate any second she seemed as madly aroused as he was he felt her unbuttoning his pants with frantic fingers her hands were cool on his hot penis she eased it out of his clothing then to his surprise and delight she knelt down as soon as her lips closed over the head he spurted uncontrollably into her mouth she sucked and licked feverishly as he did so when the climax was over she continued to kiss it until it softened then she gently put it away and stood up that was exciting she whispered thank you he had been about to thank her instead he put his arms around her and pulled her close he felt so grateful to her that he could have wept he had not realized how badly he needed a womans affection tonight some kind of shadow had been lifted from him i cant tell you he began but he could not find words to explain how much it meant to him then dont she said i know anyway i could feel it they walked to her building at the door he said can we she put a finger on his lips to silence him go and win the war she said then she went inside v when daisy went to a sunday service which was not often she now avoided the elite churches of the west end whose congregations had snubbed her and instead caught the tube to aldgate and attended the calvary gospel hall the doctrinal differences were wide but they did not matter to her the singing was better in the east end she and lloyd arrived separately people in aldgate knew who she was and they liked having a rogue aristocrat sitting on one of their cheap seats but it would have been pushing their tolerance too far for a marriedandseparated woman to walk in on the arm of her paramour ethels brother billy had said jesus did not condemn the adulteress but he did tell her to sin no more during the service she thought about boy had he really meant last nights conciliatory words or were they just the softness of the drunken moment boy had even shaken hands with lloyd as he left surely that meant forgiveness but she told herself not to let her hopes rise boy was the most completely selfabsorbed person she had ever known worse than his father or her brother greg after church daisy often went to eth leckwiths house for sunday dinner but today she left lloyd to his family and hurried away she returned to the west end and knocked on the door of her husbands house in mayfair the butler showed her into the morning room boy came in shouting what the hell is this he roared and he threw a newspaper at her she had seen him in this mood plenty of times and she was not afraid of him only once had he raised a hand to strike her she had seized a heavy candlestick and threatened to bop him it had not happened again though not scared she was disappointed he had been in such a good mood last night but perhaps he might still listen to reason what has happened to displease you she said calmly look at that bloody paper she bent and picked it up it was todays edition of the sunday mirror a popular leftwing tabloid on the front page was a photograph of boys new horse lucky laddie and the headline lucky laddie worth coal miners the story of boys recordbreaking purchase had appeared in yesterdays press but today the mirror had an outraged opinion piece pointing out that the price of the horse was exactly twentyeight times the standard compensation paid to the widow of a miner who died in a pit accident and the fitzherbert family wealth came from coal mines boy said my father is furious he was hoping to be foreign secretary in the postwar government this has probably ruined his chances daisy said in exasperation boy kindly explain why this is my fault look who wrote the damned thing daisy looked by billy williams member of parliament for aberowen boy said your boyfriends uncle do you imagine he consults me before writing his articles he wagged a finger for some reason that family hates us they think its unfair that you should make so much money from coal when the miners themselves get such a raw deal there is a war on you know you live on inherited money he said and i didnt see much sign of wartime austerity at your piccadilly apartment last night youre right she said but i gave a party for the troops you spent a fortune on a horse its my money but you got it from coal youve spent so much time in bed with that williams bastard that youve become a bloody bolshevik and thats one more thing thats driving us apart boy do you really want to stay married to me you could find someone who suits you half the girls in london would love to be viscountess aberowen i wont do anything for that damned williams family anyway i heard last night that your boyfriend wants to be a member of parliament hell make a great one not with you in tow he wont even get elected hes a bloody socialist youre an exfascist ive thought about this i know its a bit of a problem problem its an insuperable barrier wait till the papers get that story youll be crucified the way ive been today i suppose youll give the story to the daily mail i wont need to his opponents will do that you mark my words with you by his side lloyd williams doesnt stand a bloody chance vi for the first five days of june lieutenant woody dewar and his platoon of paratroopers plus a thousand or so others were isolated at an airfield somewhere northwest of london an aircraft hangar had been converted into a giant dormitory with hundreds of cots in long rows there were movies and jazz records to entertain them while they waited their objective was normandy by means of elaborate deception plans the allies had tried to convince the german high command that the target would be two hundred miles northeast at calais if the germans had been fooled the invasion force would meet relatively light resistance at least for the first few hours the paratroopers were to be the first wave in the middle of the night the second wave would be the main force of men aboard a fleet of five thousand vessels landing on the beaches of normandy at dawn by then the paratroopers should have already destroyed inland strongpoints and taken control of key transport links woodys platoon had to capture a bridge across a river in a small town called eglisedessoeurs ten miles inland when they had done so they had to keep control of the bridge blocking any german units that might be sent to reinforce the beach until the main invasion force caught up with them at all costs they must prevent the germans from blowing up the bridge while they waited for the green light ace webber ran a marathon poker game winning a thousand dollars and losing it again lefty cameron obsessively cleaned and oiled his lightweight m semiautomatic carbine the paratrooper model with a folding stock lonnie callaghan and tony bonanio who did not like one another went to mass together every day sneaky pete schneider sharpened the commando knife he had bought in london until he could have shaved with it patrick timothy who looked like clark gable and had a similar moustache played a ukulele the same tune over and over again driving everybody crazy sergeant defoe wrote long letters to his wife then tore them up and started again mack trulove and smoking joe morgan cropped and shaved each others hair believing that would make it easier for the medics to deal with head injuries most of them had nicknames woody had discovered that his own was scotch dday was set for sunday june then postponed because of bad weather on monday june in the evening the colonel made a speech men he shouted tonight is the night we invade france they roared their approval woody thought it was ironic they were safe and warm here but they could hardly wait to get over there jump out of airplanes and land in the arms of enemy troops who wanted to kill them they were given a special meal all they could eat steak pork chicken fries ice cream woody did not want any he had more idea than the men of what was ahead of him and he did not want to do it on a full stomach he got coffee and a donut the coffee was american fragrant and delicious unlike the frightful brew served up by the british when they had any coffee at all he took off his boots and lay down on his cot he thought about bella hernandez her lopsided smile and her soft breasts next thing he knew a hooter was sounding for a moment woody thought he was waking from a bad dream in which he was going into battle to kill people then he realized it was true they all put on their jump suits and assembled their equipment they had too much some of it was essential a carbine with rounds of ammunition antitank grenades a small bomb known as a gammon grenade krations water purifying tablets a firstaid kit with morphine other things they might have done without an entrenching tool shaving kit a french phrase book they were so overloaded that the smaller men struggled to walk to the planes lined up on the runway in the dark their transport aircraft were c skytrains to woodys surprise he saw by the dim lights that they had all been painted with distinctive black and white stripes the pilot of his aircraft a badtempered midwesterner called captain bonner said thats to prevent us being shot down by our own goddamn side before boarding the men were weighed donegan and bonanio both had disassembled bazookas packed in bags that dangled from their legs adding eighty pounds to their weight as the total mounted captain bonner became angry youre overloading me he snarled at woody i wont get this motherfucker off the ground not my decision captain woody said talk to the colonel sergeant defoe boarded first and went to the front of the plane taking a seat beside the open arch leading to the flight deck he would be the last to jump any man who developed a lastminute reluctance to leap into the night would be helped along with a good shove from defoe donegan and bonanio carrying the leg bags holding their bazookas as well as everything else had to be helped up the steps woody as platoon commander boarded last he would be first out and first on the ground the interior was a tube with a row of simple metal seats on either side the men had trouble fastening seat belts around their equipment and some did not bother the door closed and the engines roared into life woody felt excited as well as scared against all reason he felt eager for the battle to come to his surprise he found himself impatient to get down on the ground meet the enemy and fire his weapons he wanted the waiting to be over he wondered if he would ever see bella hernandez again he thought he could feel the plane straining as it lumbered down the runway painfully it picked up speed it seemed to rumble along on the ground for ever woody found himself wondering how long the damn runway was anyhow then at last it lifted there was little sensation of flying and he thought the plane must be remaining just a few feet above the ground then he looked out he was sitting by the rearmost of the seven windows next to the door and he could see the shrouded lights of the base dropping away they were airborne the sky was overcast but the clouds were faintly luminous presumably because the moon had risen beyond them there was a blue light at the tip of each wing and woody could see as his plane moved into formation with others forming a giant v shape the cabin was so noisy that men had to shout into one anothers ears to be heard and conversation soon ceased they all shifted in their hard seats trying in vain to get comfortable some closed their eyes but woody doubted that anyone actually slept they were flying low not much above a thousand feet and occasionally woody saw the dull pewter gleam of rivers and lakes at one point he glimpsed a crowd of people hundreds of faces all staring up at the planes roaring overhead woody knew that more than a thousand aircraft were flying over southern england at the same time and he realized it must be a remarkable sight it occurred to him that those people were watching history being made and he was part of it after half an hour they crossed the english beach resorts and were over the sea for a moment the moon shone through a break in the cloud and woody saw the ships he could hardly believe what he was looking at it was a floating town vessels of all sizes sailing in ragged rows like assorted houses in city streets thousands of them as far as the eye could see before he could call the attention of his comrades to the remarkable sight the clouds covered the moon again and the vision was gone like a dream the planes headed right in a long curve aiming to hit france to the west of the drop area and then follow the coastline eastwards checking position by terrain features to ensure the paratroopers landed where they should the channel islands british though closer to france had been occupied by germany at the end of the battle of france in and now as the armada overflew the islands german antiaircraft guns opened fire at such a low altitude the skytrains were terribly vulnerable woody realized he could be killed even before he reached the battlefield he would hate to die pointlessly captain bonner zigzagged to avoid the flak woody was glad he did but the effect on the men was unfortunate they all felt airsick woody included patrick timothy was the first to succumb and vomited on the floor the foul smell made others feel worse sneaky pete threw up next then several men all at once they had stuffed themselves with steak and ice cream all of which now came back up the stink was appalling and the floor became disgustingly slippery the flight path straightened as they left the islands behind a few minutes later the french coast appeared the plane banked and turned left the copilot got up from his seat and spoke in the ear of sergeant defoe who turned to the platoon and held up ten fingers ten minutes to drop the plane slowed from its cruising speed of mph to the approximate speed for a parachute jump about mph suddenly they entered fog it was heavy enough to blot out the blue light at the tip of the wing woodys heart raced for planes flying in close formation this was very dangerous how tragic it would be to die in a plane crash not even in combat but bonner could do nothing but fly straight and level and hope for the best any change of direction would cause a collision the plane left the fog bank as suddenly as it had entered it to either side the other planes were still miraculously in formation almost immediately antiaircraft fire broke out the flak exploding in deadly blossoms among the serried planes in these circumstances woody knew the pilots orders were to maintain speed and fly straight to the target zone but bonner defied orders and broke formation the roar of the engines went to full throttle he began to zigzag again the nose of the plane dipped as he tried for more speed looking out of the window woody saw that many other pilots had been equally undisciplined they could not control the urge to save their own lives the red light went on over the door four minutes to go woody felt certain the crew had put the light on too soon desperate to dump their troops and fly to safety but they had the charts and he could not argue he got to his feet stand up and hook he yelled most of the men could not hear him but they knew what he was saying they got up and each man clipped his static line to the overhead cable so that he could not be thrown through the door accidentally the door opened and the wind roared in the plane was still going too fast jumping at this speed was unpleasant but that was not the main problem they would land farther apart and it would take woody much longer to find his men on the ground his approach to his objective would be delayed he would begin his mission behind schedule he cursed bonner the pilot continued to bank one way then the other dodging flak the men struggled to keep their footing on a floor that was slimy with vomit woody looked out of the open door bonner had lost height while trying to gain speed and the plane was now at about five hundred feet too low there might not be enough time for the parachutes to open fully before the men hit the ground he hesitated then beckoned his sergeant forward defoe stood beside him and looked down then shook his head he put his mouth to woodys ear and shouted half our men will break their ankles if we jump at this height the bazooka carriers will kill themselves woody made a decision make sure no one jumps he yelled at defoe then he unhooked his static line and went forward pushing through the double row of standing men to the flight deck there were three crew yelling at the top of his voice woody said climb climb bonner yelled get back there and jump no one is going to jump at this altitude woody leaned over and pointed at the altimeter which showed feet its suicide get off the flight deck lieutenant thats an order woody was outranked but he stood his ground not until you gain height well be past your target zone if you dont jump now woody lost his temper climb you dumb fuck climb bonner looked furious but woody did not move he knew the pilot would not want to return home with a full plane he would face a military inquiry into what had gone wrong bonner had disobeyed too many orders tonight for that with a curse he jerked the control lever back the nose went up immediately and the aircraft began to gain height and lose speed satisfied bonner snarled hell no woody was not going to go aft now and give bonner the chance to reverse the manoeuvre we jump at a thousand feet bonner went to full throttle woody kept his eyes on the altimeter when it touched he went aft he pushed through his men reached the door looked out gave the men the thumbsup and jumped his chute opened immediately he dropped fast through the air while it spread its dome then his fall was arrested seconds later he hit water he suffered a splitsecond of panic fearing that the cowardly bonner had dropped them all in the sea then his feet touched solid ground or at least soft mud and he understood that he had come down in a flooded field the silk of the parachute fell around him he struggled out of its folds and unfastened his harness standing in two feet of water he looked around this was either a water meadow or more likely a field that had been flooded by the germans to impede an invasion force he saw no one enemy or friend and no animals either but the light was poor he checked his watch it was am then looked at his compass and oriented himself next he took his m carbine out of its case and unfolded the stock he snapped a round magazine into the slot then worked the slide to chamber a round finally he rotated the safety lever into the disengaged position he reached into a pocket and took out a small tin object like a childs toy when pressed it made a distinctive clicking sound it had been issued to everyone so that they could recognize each other in the dark without resorting to giveaway english passwords when he was ready he looked around again experimentally he pressed the click twice after a moment an answering click came from directly ahead he splashed through the water he smelled vomit in a low voice he said whos there patrick timothy lieutenant dewar here follow me timothy had been second to jump so woody figured if he continued in the same direction he had a good chance of finding the others fifty yards along he bumped into mack and smoking joe who had found one another they emerged from the water on to a narrow road and found their first casualties lonnie and tony with their bazookas in leg bags had both landed too hard i think lonnies dead said tony woody checked he was right lonnie was not breathing he looked as if he had broken his neck tony himself could not move and woody thought the mans leg was broken he gave him a shot of morphine then dragged him off the road into the next field tony would have to wait there for the medics woody ordered mack and smoking joe to hide lonnies body for fear it might lead the germans to tony he tried to see the landscape around him straining to recognize something that corresponded to his map the task seemed impossible especially in the dark how was he going to lead these men to the objective if he did not know where he was the only thing of which he could be reasonably sure was that they had not landed where they were supposed to he heard a strange noise and a moment later he saw a light he motioned the others to duck down the paratroopers were not supposed to use flashlights and french people were subject to a curfew so the person approaching was probably a german soldier in the dim light woody saw a bicycle he stood up and aimed his carbine he thought of shooting the rider immediately but could not bring himself to do it instead he shouted halt arretez the cycle stopped hello loot said the rider and woody recognized the voice of ace webber woody lowered his weapon where did you get the bike he said incredulously outside a farmhouse ace said laconically woody led the group the way ace had come figuring that the others were more likely to be in that direction than any other he looked anxiously for terrain features to match his map but it was too dark he felt useless and stupid he was the officer he had to solve such problems he picked up more of his platoon on the road then they came to a windmill woody decided he could not blunder around any longer so he went to the mill house and hammered on the door an upstairs window opened and a man said in french who is it the americans woody said vive la france what do you want to set you free woody said in schoolboy french but first i need some help with my map the miller laughed and said im coming down a minute later woody was in the kitchen spreading his silk map over the table under a bright light the miller showed him where he was it was not as bad as woody had feared despite captain bonners panic they were only four miles northeast of eglisedessoeurs the miller traced the best route on the map a girl of about thirteen crept into the room in a nightdress maman says youre american she said to woody thats right mademoiselle he said do you know gladys angelus woody laughed as it happens i did meet her once at the apartment of a friends father is she really really beautiful even more beautiful than she looks in the movies i knew it the miller offered him wine no thanks said woody maybe after weve won the miller kissed him on both cheeks woody went back outside and led his platoon away heading in the direction of eglisedessoeurs including himself nine of the original eighteen were now together they had suffered two casualties lonnie dead and tony wounded and seven more had not yet appeared his orders were not to spend too much time trying to find everyone as soon as he had enough men to do the job he was to proceed to the target one of the missing seven showed up right away sneaky pete emerged from a ditch and joined the group with a casual hi gang as if it was the most natural thing in the world what were you doing in there woody asked him i thought you were german pete said i was hiding woody had seen the pale gleam of parachute silk in the ditch pete must have been hiding there since he landed he had obviously panicked and curled up in a ball but woody pretended to accept his story the one woody really wanted to find was sergeant defoe he was an experienced soldier and woody had been planning to rely heavily on him but he was nowhere to be seen they were approaching a crossroads when they heard noises woody identified the sound of an engine idling and two or three voices in conversation he ordered everyone down on their hands and knees and the platoon advanced crawling up ahead he saw that a motorcycle rider had stopped to talk to two men on foot all three were in uniform they were speaking german there was a building at the crossroads perhaps a small tavern or a bakery he decided to wait perhaps they would leave he wanted his group to move silently and unobserved for as long as possible after five minutes he ran out of patience he turned around patrick timothy he hissed someone else said pukey pat scotch wants you timothy crawled forward he still smelled of vomit and now it had become his name woody had seen timothy play baseball and knew he could throw hard and accurately hit that motorcycle with a grenade woody said timothy took a grenade from his pack pulled the pin and lobbed it there was a clang one of the men said in german what was that then the grenade detonated there were two explosions the first knocked all three germans to the ground the second was the motorcycles fuel tank blowing up and it sent a starburst of flame that burned the men leaving a stink of scorched flesh stay where you are woody shouted to his platoon he watched the building was there anyone inside during the next five minutes no one opened a window or a door either the place was empty or the occupants were hiding under their beds woody got to his feet and waved the platoon on he felt strange as he stepped over the grisly bodies of the three germans he had ordered their deaths men who had mothers and fathers wives or girlfriends perhaps sons and daughters now each man was an ugly mess of blood and burned flesh woody should have felt triumphant it was his first encounter with the enemy and he had vanquished them but he just felt a bit sick past the crossroads he set a brisk pace and ordered no talking or smoking to keep up his strength he ate a bar of dration chocolate which was a bit like builders putty with sugar added after half an hour he heard a car and ordered everyone to hide in the fields the vehicle was travelling fast with its headlights on it was probably german but the allies were sending over jeeps by glider along with antitank guns and other artillery so it was just possible this was a friendly vehicle he lay under a hedge and watched it go by it went too fast for him to identify it he wondered whether he should have ordered the platoon to shoot it up no he thought on balance they did better to focus on their mission they passed through three hamlets that woody was able to identify on his map dogs barked occasionally but no one came to investigate doubtless the french had learned to mind their own business under enemy occupation it was eerie creeping along foreign roads in the dark armed to the teeth passing quiet houses where people slept unconscious of the deadly firepower outside their windows at last they came to the outskirts of eglisedessoeurs woody ordered a short rest they entered a little stand of trees and sat on the ground they drank from their canteens and ate rations woody still would not permit smoking the glow of a cigarette could be seen from surprisingly far the road they were on should lead straight to the bridge he reckoned there was no hard information about how the bridge was guarded since the allies had decided it was important he assumed the germans thought the same therefore some security was likely but it might be anything from one man with a rifle to a whole platoon woody could not plan the assault until he saw the target after ten minutes he moved them on the men did not have to be nagged about silence now they sensed the danger they trod quietly along the street past houses and churches and shops keeping to the sides peering into the gloomy night jumping at the least sound a sudden loud cough from an open bedroom window almost caused woody to fire his carbine eglisedessoeurs was a large village rather than a small town and woody saw the silver glint of the river sooner than he expected he raised a hand for them all to halt the main street led gently downhill at a slight angle to the bridge so he had a good view the waterway was about a hundred feet wide and the bridge had a single curved span it must be an old structure he guessed because it was so narrow that two cars could not have passed the bad news was that there was a pillbox at each end twin concrete domes with horizontal shooting slits a pair of sentries patrolled the bridge between the pillboxes they stood one at each end the nearer one was speaking through a firing slit presumably chatting to whomever was inside then they both walked to the middle where they looked over the parapet at the black water flowing beneath they did not appear very tense so woody deduced they had not yet learned that the invasion had begun on the other hand they were not slacking they were awake and moving and looking about them with some degree of alertness woody could not guess how many men were inside nor how they were armed were there machine guns behind those slits or just rifles it would make a big difference woody wished he had some experience of battle how was he supposed to deal with this situation he guessed there must be thousands of men like him new junior officers who just had to make it up as they went along if only sergeant defoe were here the easy way to neutralize a pillbox was to sneak up and put a grenade through one of the slits a good man could probably crawl to the nearer one unobserved but woody needed to take out both at the same time otherwise the attack on the first would forewarn the occupants of the second how could he reach the farther pillbox without being seen by the patrolling sentries he sensed his men getting restless they did not like to think their leader might be unsure as to what to do next sneaky pete he said youll crawl up to that nearest pillbox and put a grenade through the slit pete looked terrified but he said yes sir next woody named the two best shots in the platoon smoking joe and mack he said choose one each of the sentries as soon as pete deploys his grenade take the sentries out the two men nodded and hefted their weapons in the absence of defoe he decided to make ace webber his deputy he named four others and said go with ace as soon as the shooting starts run like hell across the bridge and storm the pillbox on the other side if youre quick enough youll catch them napping yes sir said ace the bastards wont know whats hit them his aggression was masking fear woody guessed everyone not in aces group follow me into the near pillbox woody felt bad about giving ace and those with him the more dangerous assignment and himself the relative safety of the nearer pillbox but it had been drummed into him that an officer must not risk his life unnecessarily for then he might leave his men leaderless they walked towards the bridge pete in the lead this was a dangerous moment ten men going along a street together could not remain unnoticed for long even at night anyone looking carefully in their direction would sense movement if the alarm was raised too soon sneaky pete might not get to the pillbox and then the platoon would lose the advantage of surprise it was a long walk pete reached a corner and stopped woody guessed he was waiting for the near sentry to leave his post outside the pillbox and walk to the middle the two sharpshooters found cover and settled in woody dropped to one knee and signalled the others to do likewise they all watched the sentry the man took a long pull on his cigarette dropped it trod on the end to put it out and blew a long cloud of smoke then he eased himself upright settled his rifle strap on his shoulder and started walking the sentry on the far side did the same pete ran the next block and came to the end of the street he got down on his hands and knees and crawled rapidly across the road he reached the pillbox and stood up no one had noticed the two sentries were still approaching one another pete took out a grenade and pulled the pin then he waited a few seconds woody guessed he did not want the men inside to have time to throw the grenade out again pete reached around the curve of the dome and gently dropped the grenade inside joe and macks carbines barked the nearer sentry fell but the farther one was unhurt to his credit he did not turn and run but courageously went down on one knee and unslung his rifle he was too slow though the carbines spoke again almost simultaneously and he fell without firing then petes grenade exploded inside the nearer pillbox with a muffled thump woody was already running full pelt and the men were close behind him within seconds he reached the bridge the pillbox had a low wooden door woody flung it open and stepped inside three men in german uniforms were dead on the floor he moved to a firing slit and looked out ace and his four men were haring across the short bridge shooting at the farther pillbox as they ran the bridge was only a hundred feet long but that proved to be fifty feet too much as they reached the middle a machine gun opened up the americans were trapped in a narrow corridor with no cover the machine gun clacked insanely and in seconds all five of them had fallen the gun continued to rake them for several seconds to be certain they were dead and in the process making sure of the two german sentries too when it stopped they were all still silence fell beside woody lefty cameron said jesus christ almighty woody could have wept he had sent ten men to their deaths five americans and five germans yet he had failed to achieve his objective the enemy still held the far end of the bridge and could stop allied forces crossing it he had four men left if they tried again and ran across the bridge together they would all be killed he needed a new plan he studied the townscape what could he do he wished he had a tank he had to act fast there might well be enemy troops elsewhere in the town they would have been alerted by the gunfire they would respond soon he could deal with them if he had both pillboxes otherwise he would be in trouble if his men could not cross the bridge he thought desperately perhaps they could swim the river he decided to take a quick look at the bank mack and smoking joe he said fire at the other pillbox see if you can get a bullet through the slit keep them busy while i scout around the carbines opened up and he went out through the door he was able to shelter behind the near pillbox while he looked over the parapet at the upstream bank then he had to scuttle across the road to see the other edge however no fire came from the enemy position there was no river wall instead an earth slope went down to the water it looked the same on the far bank he thought though there was not enough light to be sure a good swimmer might get across under the span of the arch he would not be easy to see from the enemy position then he could repeat on the far side what sneaky pete had done this side and grenade the pillbox looking at the structure of the bridge he had a better idea below the level of the parapet was a stone ledge a foot wide a man with steady nerves could crawl across all the time remaining out of sight he returned to the captured pillbox the smallest man was lefty cameron he was also feisty not the type to get the shakes lefty said woody theres a hidden ledge that runs across the outside of the bridge below the parapet probably used by workmen doing repairs i want you to crawl across and grenade the other pillbox you bet said lefty it was a gutsy response from someone who had just seen five comrades killed woody turned to mack and smoking joe and said give him cover they began to shoot lefty said what if i fall in its only fifteen or twenty feet above the water at most woody said youll be fine okay said lefty he went to the door i cant swim though he said then he was gone woody saw him dart across the road he looked over the parapet then straddled it and eased down the other side until he was lost to view okay he said to the others hold your fire hes on his way they all stared out nothing moved it was dawn woody realized the town was coming more clearly into view but none of the inhabitants showed themselves they knew better perhaps german troops were mobilizing in some neighbouring street but he could hear nothing he realized he was listening for a splash fearful that lefty would fall in the river a dog came trotting across the bridge a mediumsize mongrel with a curled tail that stuck up jauntily it sniffed the dead bodies with curiosity then moved on purposefully as if it had an important rendezvous elsewhere woody watched it pass the far pillbox and continue into the other side of the town dawn meant the main force was now landing on the beaches someone had said it was the largest amphibious attack in the history of warfare he wondered what kind of resistance they were meeting there was no one more vulnerable than an infantryman loaded with gear splashing through the shallows the flat beach ahead of him offering a clear field of fire to gunners in the dunes woody felt grateful for this concrete pillbox lefty was taking a long time had he fallen in the water quietly could something else have gone wrong then woody saw him a slim khaki form bellying over the parapet of the bridge at the far end woody held his breath lefty dropped to his knees crawled to the pillbox and came upright with his back flat against the curved concrete with his left hand he drew out a grenade he pulled the pin waited a couple of seconds then reached around and threw the grenade through the slit woody heard the boom of the explosion and saw a flash of lurid light from the firing slits lefty raised his arms above his head like a champion get back under cover asshole woody said though lefty could not hear him there could be a german soldier hiding in a nearby building waiting to avenge the deaths of his friends but no shot rang out and after a brief victory dance lefty went inside the pillbox and woody breathed more easily however he was not yet fully secure at this point a sudden sally by a couple of dozen germans could win the bridge back then it would all have been in vain he forced himself to wait another minute to see if any enemy troops showed themselves still nothing moved it was beginning to look as if there were no germans in eglisedessoeurs other than those manning the bridge they were probably relieved every twelve hours from a barracks a few miles away smoking joe he said get rid of the dead germans throw them in the river joe dragged the three bodies out of the pillbox and disposed of them then did the same with the two sentries pete and mack woody said go over to the other pillbox and join lefty make sure the three of you stay alert we havent killed all the germans in france yet if you see enemy troops approaching your position dont hesitate dont negotiate just shoot them the two men left the pillbox and walked briskly across the bridge to the far end there were now three americans in the far pillbox if the germans tried to retake the bridge they would have a hard time of it especially in the growing light woody realized that the dead americans on the bridge would forewarn any approaching enemy forces that the pillboxes had been captured otherwise he might retain an element of surprise that meant he had to get rid of the american corpses too he told the others what he was going to do then stepped outside the morning air tasted fresh and clean he walked to the middle of the bridge he checked each body for a pulse but there was no doubt they were all dead one by one he picked up his comrades and dropped them over the parapet the last one was ace webber as he hit the water woody said rest in peace buddies he stood still for a minute with his head bent and his eyes closed when he turned around the sun was coming up vii the great fear of allied planners was that the germans would rapidly reinforce their troops in normandy and mount a powerful counterattack that would drive the invaders back into the sea in a repeat of the dunkirk disaster lloyd williams was one of the people trying to make sure that did not happen his job helping escaped prisoners get home had low priority after the invasion and he was now working with the french resistance at the end of may the bbc broadcast coded messages that triggered a campaign of sabotage in germanoccupied france during the first few days of june hundreds of telephone lines were cut usually in hardtofind places fuel depots were set on fire roads were blocked by trees and tyres were slashed lloyd was assisting the railwaymen who were strongly communist and called themselves resistance fer for years they had maddened the nazis with their sly subversion german troop trains somehow got diverted down obscure branch lines and sent many miles out of their way engines broke down unaccountably and carriages were derailed it was so bad that the occupiers brought railwaymen from germany to run the system but the disruption got worse in the spring of the railwaymen began to damage their own network they blew up tracks and sabotaged the heavy lifting cranes required for moving crashed trains the nazis did not take this lying down hundreds of railwaymen were executed and thousands deported to camps but the campaign escalated and by dday rail traffic in some parts of france had come to a halt now on dday plus one lloyd lay at the summit of an embankment beside the main line to rouen capital city of normandy at a point where the track entered a tunnel from his vantage point he could see approaching trains a mile away with lloyd were two others codenamed legionnaire and cigare legionnaire was leader of the resistance in this neighbourhood cigare was a railwayman lloyd had brought the dynamite supplying weaponry was the main role played by the british in the french resistance the three men were half hidden by long grass dotted with wild flowers it was the kind of place to bring a girl on a fine day such as this lloyd thought daisy would like it a train appeared in the distance cigare scrutinized it as it came nearer he was about sixty wiry and small with the lined face of a heavy smoker when the train was still a quarter of a mile away he shook his head in negation this was not the one they were waiting for the engine passed them puffing smoke and entered the tunnel it was hauling four passenger coaches all full carrying a mixture of civilians and uniformed men lloyd had more important prey in his sights legionnaire looked at his watch he had dark skin and a black moustache and lloyd guessed he might have a north african somewhere in his ancestry now he was jumpy they were exposed here in the open air and in daylight the longer they stayed the higher the chance they would be spotted how much longer he said worriedly cigare shrugged well see lloyd said in french you can leave now if you wish everything is set legionnaire did not reply he was not going to miss the action for the sake of his prestige and authority he had to be able to say i was there cigare tensed peering into the distance the skin around his eyes creasing with the effort so he said cryptically he raised himself to his knees lloyd could hardly see the train let alone identify it but cigare was alert it was moving a lot faster than the previous one lloyd could tell as it came closer he observed that it was longer too twentyfour carriages or more he thought this is it said cigare lloyds pulse quickened if cigare was right this was a german troop train carrying more than a thousand officers and men to the normandy battlefield perhaps the first of many such trains it was lloyds job to make sure neither this train nor any following passed through the tunnel then he saw something else a plane was tracking the train as he watched the aircraft matched course with the train and began to lose height the plane was british lloyd recognized it as a hawker typhoon nicknamed a tiffy a oneman fighterbomber tiffies were often given the dangerous mission of penetrating deep behind enemy lines to harass communications there was a brave man at the controls lloyd thought but this formed no part of lloyds plan he did not want the train to be wrecked before it reached the tunnel shit he said the tiffy fired a machinegun burst at the carriages legionnaire said but what is this lloyd replied in english fucked if i know he could see now that the engine was hauling a mixture of passenger coaches and cattle trucks however the cattle trucks probably also contained men the plane travelling faster strafed the carriages as it overhauled the train it had four beltfed mm cannon and they made a fearsome rattling sound that could be heard over the roar of the planes engine and the energetic puffing of the train lloyd could not help feeling sorry for the trapped soldiers unable to get out of the way of the lethal hail of bullets he wondered why the pilot did not fire his rockets they were highly destructive against trains or cars though difficult to fire accurately perhaps they had been used up in an earlier encounter some of the germans bravely put their heads out of the windows and fired pistols and rifles at the plane with no effect but lloyd now saw a light antiaircraft battery emplaced on a flatbed car immediately behind the engine two gunners were hastily deploying the big gun it swivelled on its base and the barrel lifted to aim at the british plane the pilot did not appear to have seen it for he held his course rounds from his cannon tearing through the roofs of the carriages as he overhauled them the big gun fired and missed lloyd wondered if he knew the flyer there were only about five thousand pilots on active service in the uk at any one time quite a lot of them had been to daisys parties lloyd thought of hubert st john a brilliant cambridge graduate with whom he had been reminiscing about student days a few weeks ago of dennis chaucer a west indian from trinidad who complained bitterly about tasteless english food especially the mashed potatoes that seemed to be served with every meal and of brian mantel an amiable australian he had brought across the pyrenees on his last trip the brave man in the tiffy could easily be someone lloyd had met the antiaircraft gun fired again and missed again either the pilot still had not seen the gun or he felt it could not hit him for he took no evasive action but continued to fly dangerously low and wreak carnage on the troop train the engine was just a few seconds from the tunnel when the plane was hit flame flared from the planes engine and black smoke billowed too late the pilot veered away from the railway track the train entered the tunnel and the carriages flashed past lloyds position he saw that every one was packed full with dozens hundreds of german soldiers the tiffy flew directly at lloyd for a moment he thought it would crash where he lay he was already flat on the ground but he stupidly put his hands over his head as if that could protect him the tiffy roared by a hundred feet above him then legionnaire pressed the plunger of the detonator there was a roar like thunder inside the tunnel as the track blew up followed by a terrible screeching of tortured steel as the train crashed at first the carriages full of soldiers continued to flash by but a second later their charge was arrested the ends of two linked carriages rose in the air forming an inverted v lloyd heard the men inside screaming all the carriages came off the rails and tumbled like dropped matchsticks around the dark o of the tunnels mouth iron crumpled like paper and broken glass rained on the three saboteurs watching from the top of the embankment they were in danger of being killed by their own explosion and without a word they all leaped to their feet and ran by the time they had reached a safe distance it was all over smoke was billowing out of the tunnel in the unlikely event that any men in there had survived the crash they would burn to death lloyds plan was a success not only had he killed hundreds of enemy troops and wrecked a train he had also blocked a main railway line crashes in tunnels took weeks to clear he had made it much more difficult for the germans to reinforce their defences in normandy he was horrified he had seen death and destruction in spain but nothing like this and he had caused it there was another crash and when he looked in the direction of the sound he saw that the tiffy had hit the ground it was burning but the fuselage had not broken up the pilot might be alive he ran towards the plane and cigare and legionnaire followed the downed aircraft lay on its belly one wing had snapped in half smoke came from the single engine the perspex dome was blackened by soot and lloyd could not see the pilot he stepped on the wing and unfastened the hood catch cigare did the same on the other side together they slid the dome back on its rails the pilot was unconscious he wore a helmet and goggles and an oxygen mask over his nose and mouth lloyd could not tell whether it was someone he knew he wondered where the oxygen tank was and whether it had yet burst legionnaire had a similar thought we have to get him out before the plane blows up he said lloyd reached inside and unfastened the safety harness then he put his hands under the pilots arms and pulled the man was completely limp lloyd had no way of knowing what his injuries might be he was not even sure the man was alive he dragged the pilot out of the cockpit then got him over his shoulder in a firemans lift and carried him a safe distance from the burning wreckage as gently as he could he laid the man on the ground face up he heard a noise that was a cross between a whoosh and a thump and looked back to see that the whole plane was ablaze he bent over the pilot and carefully removed the goggles and the oxygen mask revealing a face that was shockingly familiar the pilot was boy fitzherbert and he was breathing lloyd wiped blood from boys nose and mouth boy opened his eyes at first there seemed no intelligence behind them then after a minute his expression altered and he said you we blew up the train lloyd said boy seemed unable to move anything but his eyes and mouth small world he said isnt it cigare said who is he lloyd hesitated then said my brother my god boys eyes closed lloyd said to legionnaire we have to bring a doctor legionnaire shook his head we must get out of here the germans will be coming to investigate the train crash within minutes lloyd knew he was right well have to take him with us boy opened his eyes and said williams what is it boy boy seemed to grin you can marry the bitch now he said then he died viii daisy cried when she heard boy had been a rotter and treated her badly but she had loved him once and he had taught her a lot about sex and she felt sad that he had been killed his brother andy was now a viscount and heir to the earldom andys wife may was a viscountess and daisys name according to the elaborate rules of the aristocracy was the dowager viscountess aberowen until she married lloyd when she would be relieved to become plain mrs williams however that might be a long time coming even now over the summer hopes of a quick end to the war came to nothing a plot by german army officers to kill hitler on july failed the germany army was in full retreat on the eastern front and the allies took paris in august but hitler was determined to fight on to the terrible end daisy had no idea when she would see lloyd let alone marry him one wednesday in september when she went to spend the evening in aldgate she was greeted by a jubilant eth leckwith great news ethel said when daisy walked into the kitchen lloyd has been selected as prospective parliamentary candidate for hoxton lloyds sister millie was there with her two children lennie and pammie isnt it wonderful she said hell be prime minister i bet yes said daisy and she sat down heavily well i can see youre not happy about that said ethel as my friend mildred would say it went down like a cup of cold sick whats the matter its just that having me as a wife isnt going to help him get elected it was because she loved him so much that she felt so bad how could she blight his prospects but how could she give him up when she thought like this her heart felt heavy and life seemed desolate because youre an heiress said ethel not just that before boy died he told me lloyd would never get elected with an exfascist as his wife she looked at ethel who always told the truth even when it hurt he was right wasnt he not entirely ethel said she put the kettle on for tea then sat opposite daisy at the kitchen table im not going to say it doesnt matter but i dont think you should despair youre just like me daisy thought you say what you think no wonder he loves me im a younger version of his mother millie said love conquers all doesnt it she noticed that fouryearold lennie was hitting twoyearold pammie with a wooden soldier dont bash your sister she said turning back to daisy she went on and my brother loves you to bits i dont think hes ever loved anyone else to tell you the truth i know said daisy she wanted to cry but hes determined to change the world and i cant bear the thought that im standing in his way ethel took the crying twoyearold on to her knee and the toddler calmed down immediately ill tell you what to do she said to daisy be prepared for questions and expect hostility but dont dodge the issue and dont hide your past what should i say you might say you were fooled by fascism as millions of others were but you drove an ambulance in the blitz and you hope youve paid your dues work out the exact words with lloyd be confident be your irresistibly charming self and dont let it get you down will it work ethel hesitated i dont know she said after a pause i really dont but you have to try it would be awful if he had to give up what he loves most for my sake something like that could destroy a marriage daisy was half hoping ethel would deny this but she did not i dont know she said again i woody dewar got used to the crutches quickly he was wounded at the end of in belgium in the battle of the bulge the allies pushing towards the german border had been surprised by a powerful counterattack woody and others of the st airborne division had held out at a vital crossroads town called bastogne when the germans sent a formal letter demanding surrender general mcauliffe sent back a oneword message that became famous nuts woodys right leg was smashed up by machinegun bullets on christmas day it hurt like hell even worse it was a month before he got out of the besieged town and into a real hospital his bones would mend and he might even lose the limp but his leg would never again be strong enough for parachuting the battle of the bulge was the last offensive of hitlers army in the west after that they would never counterattack again woody returned to civilian life which meant he could live at his parents apartment in washington and enjoy being fussed over by his mother when the plaster cast came off he went back to work at his fathers office on thursday april he was in the capitol building the home of the senate and the house of representatives hobbling slowly through the basement talking to his father about refugees we think about twentyone million people in europe have been driven from their homes said gus the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration is ready to help them i guess that will start any day now said woody the red army is almost in berlin and the us army is only fifty miles away how much longer can hitler hold out a sane man would have surrendered by now woody lowered his voice somebody told me the russians found what seems to have been an extermination camp the nazis killed hundreds of people a day there a place called auschwitz in poland gus nodded grimly its true the public dont know yet but theyll find out sooner or later someone should be put on trial for that the un war crimes commission has been at work for a couple of years now making lists of war criminals and collecting evidence someone will be put on trial provided we can keep the united nations going after the war of course we can woody said indignantly roosevelt campaigned on that basis last year and he won the election the united nations conference opens in san francisco in a couple of weeks san francisco had a special significance for woody because bella hernandez lived there but he had not yet told his father about her the american people want to see international cooperation so that we never have another war like this one who could be against that youd be surprised look most republicans are decent men who simply have a view of the world that is different from ours but there is a hard core of fucking nutcases woody was startled his father rarely swore the types who planned an insurrection against roosevelt in the thirties gus went on businessmen like henry ford who thought hitler was a good strong anticommunist leader they sign up for rightwing groups such as america first woody could not remember him speaking this angrily before if these fools have their way there will be a third world war even worse than the first two gus said ive lost a son to war and if i ever have a grandson i dont want to lose him too woody suffered a stab of grief joanne would have given gus grandchildren if she had lived right now woody was not even dating so grandchildren were a distant prospect unless he could track down bella in san francisco we cant do anything about complete idiots gus went on but perhaps we can deal with senator vandenberg arthur vandenberg was a republican from michigan a conservative and an opponent of roosevelts new deal he was on the senate foreign relations committee with gus hes our greatest danger gus said he may be selfimportant and vain but he commands respect the president has been wooing him and hes come around to our point of view but he could backslide why would he do that hes strongly anticommunist nothing wrong with that we are too yes but arthur is kind of rigid about it hell get riled if we do anything he thinks is kowtowing to moscow such as god knows what kind of compromises we might have to make in san francisco weve already agreed to admit belorussia and the ukraine as separate states which is just a way of giving moscow three votes in the general assembly we have to keep the soviets on board but if we go too far arthur could turn against the whole united nations project then the senate may refuse to ratify it exactly the way they rejected the league of nations in so our job in san francisco is to keep the soviets happy without offending senator vandenberg exactly they heard running footsteps an unusual sound in the dignified hallways of the capitol they both looked around woody was surprised to see the vicepresident harry truman running through the hallway he was dressed normally in a grey doublebreasted suit and a polkadot tie though he had no hat he seemed to have lost his normal escort of aides and secret service guards he was running steadily breathing hard not looking at anyone going somewhere in a terrific hurry woody and gus watched in astonishment so did everyone else when truman disappeared around a corner woody said what the heck gus said i think the president must have died ii volodya peshkov entered germany in a tenwheeler studebaker us army truck made in south bend indiana the truck had been carried by rail to baltimore shipped across the atlantic and around the cape of good hope to the persian gulf then sent by train from persia to central russia volodya knew it was one of two hundred thousand studebaker trucks given to the red army by the american government the russians liked them they were tough and reliable the men said the letters usa stencilled on the side stood for ubit sukina syna adolf which meant kill that son of a bitch adolf they also liked the food the americans were sending especially the cans of compressed meat called spam strangely bright pink in colour but gloriously fatty volodya had been posted to germany because the intelligence he was getting from spies in berlin was now not as uptodate as information that could be gained by interviewing german prisoners of war his fluent german made him a firstclass frontline interrogator when he crossed the border he had seen a soviet government poster that said red army soldier you are now on german soil the hour of revenge has struck it was among the milder pieces of propaganda the kremlin had been whipping up hatred of germans for some time believing it would make soldiers fight harder political commissars had calculated or said they had the number of men killed in battle the number of houses torched the number of civilians murdered for being communists or slavs or jews in every village and town overrun by the german army many frontline soldiers could quote the figures for their own neighbourhoods and were eager to do the same kind of damage in germany the red army had reached the river oder which snaked north south across prussia the last barrier before berlin a million soviet soldiers were within fifty miles of the capital poised to strike volodya was with the fifth shock army waiting for the fighting to begin he was studying the army newspaper red star what he read horrified him the hate propaganda went further than anything he had read before if you have not killed at least one german a day you have wasted that day he read if you are waiting for the fighting kill a german before combat if you kill one german kill another there is nothing more amusing for us than a heap of german corpses kill the german this is your old mothers prayer kill the german this is what your children beseech you to do kill the german this is the cry of your russian earth do not waver do not let up kill it was a bit sickening volodya thought but worse was implied the writer made light of looting german women are only losing fur coats and silver spoons that were stolen in the first place and there was a sidelong joke about rape soviet soldiers do not refuse the compliments of german women soldiers were not the most civilized of men in the first place the way the invading germans had behaved in had enraged all russians the government was fuelling their wrath with talk of revenge and now the army newspaper was making it clear they could do anything they liked to the defeated germans it was a recipe for armageddon iii erik von ulrich was consumed by a yearning that the war should be over with his friend hermann braun and their boss dr weiss erik set up a field hospital in a small protestant church then they sat in the nave with nothing to do but wait for the horsedrawn ambulances to arrive loaded with horribly torn and burned men the german army had reinforced seelow heights overlooking the oder river where it passed closest to berlin eriks aid station was in a village a mile back from the line dr weiss who had a friend in army intelligence said there were germans defending berlin against a million soviets with his usual sarcasm he said but our morale is high and adolf hitler is the greatest genius in military history so we are certain to win there was no hope but german soldiers were still fighting fiercely erik believed this was because of the stories filtering back about how the red army behaved prisoners were killed homes were looted and wrecked women were raped and nailed to barn doors the germans believed they were defending their own families from communist brutality the kremlins hate propaganda was backfiring erik was looking forward to defeat he longed for the killing to stop he just wanted to go home he would have his wish soon or he would be dead sleeping on a wooden pew erik was awakened at three oclock in the morning on monday april by the russian guns he had heard artillery bombardments before but this was ten times as loud as anything in his experience for the men on the front line it must have been literally deafening the wounded started to arrive at dawn and the team went wearily to work amputating limbs setting broken bones extracting bullets and cleaning and bandaging wounds they were short of everything from drugs to clean water and they gave morphine only to those who were screaming in agony men who could still walk and hold a gun were sent back to the line the german defenders held out longer than dr weiss expected at the end of the first day they were still in position and as darkness fell the rush of wounded slowed the medical unit got some sleep that night early on the next day werner franck was brought in his right wrist horribly crushed he was a captain now he had been in charge of a section of the line with thirty mm flak guns we only had eight shells for each gun he said while dr weisss clever fingers worked slowly and meticulously to set his smashed bones our orders were to fire seven at the russian tanks then use the eighth to destroy our own gun so that it could not be used by the reds he had been standing by an when it suffered a direct hit from the soviet artillery and turned over on him i was lucky it was only my hand he said it might have been my damn head when his wrist had been taped up he said to erik have you heard from carla erik knew that his sister and werner were now a couple i havent had any letters for weeks nor me i hear things are pretty grim in berlin i hope shes all right i worry too said erik surprisingly the germans held the seelow heights for another day and night the dressing station got no warning that the line had collapsed they were triaging a fresh cartload of wounded when seven or eight soviet soldiers crashed into the church one fired a machinegun burst at the vaulted ceiling and erik threw himself to the ground as did everyone else capable of moving seeing that no one was armed the russians relaxed they went around the room taking watches and rings from those who had them then they left erik wondered what would happen next this was the first time he had been trapped behind enemy lines should they abandon the field hospital and try to catch up with their retreating army or were their patients safer here dr weiss was decisive carry on with your work everyone he said a few minutes later a soviet soldier came in with a comrade over his shoulder pointing his gun at weiss he spoke a rapid stream of russian he was in a panic and his friend was covered in blood weiss replied calmly in halting russian he said no need for the gun put your friend on this table the soldier did so and the team went to work the soldier kept his rifle pointed at the doctor later in the day the german patients were marched or carried out and put into the back of a truck which drove away east erik watched werner franck disappear a prisoner of war as a boy erik had often been told the story of his uncle robert who had been imprisoned by the russians during the first world war and had walked home from siberia a journey of four thousand miles erik wondered now where werner would end up more wounded russians were brought in and the germans took care of them as they would have of their own men later as erik fell into an exhausted sleep he realized that now he too was a prisoner of war iv as the allied armies closed in on berlin the victorious countries began squabbling among themselves at the united nations conference in san francisco woody would have found it depressing except that he was more interested in trying to reconnect with bella hernandez she had been on his mind all through the dday invasion and the fighting in france his time in hospital and his convalescence a year ago she had been at the end of her period at oxford university and planning to do a doctorate at berkeley right here in san francisco she would probably be living at her parents home in pacific heights unless she had an apartment near the campus unfortunately he was having trouble getting a message to her his letters were not answered when he called the number listed in the phone book a middleaged woman who he suspected was bellas mother said with icy courtesy shes not at home right now may i give her a message bella never called back she probably had a serious boyfriend if so he wanted her to tell him but perhaps her mother was intercepting her mail and not passing on messages he should probably give up he might be making a fool of himself but that was not his way he recalled his long stubborn courtship of joanne there seems to be a pattern here he thought is it something about me meanwhile every morning he went with his father to the penthouse at the top of the fairmont hotel where secretary of state edward stettinius held a briefing for the american team at the conference stettinius had taken over from cordell hull who was in hospital the usa also had a new president harry truman who had been sworn in on the death of the great franklin d roosevelt it was a pity gus dewar observed that at such a crucial moment in world history the united states should be led by two inexperienced newcomers things had begun badly president truman had clumsily offended soviet foreign minister molotov at a preconference meeting at the white house consequently molotov arrived in san francisco in a foul mood he announced he was going home unless the conference agreed immediately to admit belorussia ukraine and poland no one wanted the ussr to pull out without the soviets the united nations were not the united nations most of the american delegation were in favour of compromising with the communists but the bowtied senator vandenberg prissily insisted that nothing should be done under pressure from moscow one morning when woody had a couple of hours to spare he went to bellas parents house the swanky neighbourhood where they lived was not far from the fairmont hotel on nob hill but woody was still walking with a cane so he took a taxi their home was a yellowpainted victorian mansion on gough street the woman who came to the door was too well dressed to be a maid she gave him a lopsided smile just like bellas she had to be the mother he said politely good morning maam im woody dewar i met bella hernandez in london last year and id sure like to see her again if i may the smile disappeared she gave him a long look and said so youre him woody had no idea what she was talking about im caroline hernandez isabels mother she said youd better come in thank you she did not offer to shake hands and she was clearly hostile though there was no clue as to why however he was inside the house mrs hernandez led woody into a large pleasant parlour with a breathtaking ocean view she pointed to a chair indicating that he should sit down with a gesture that was barely polite she sat opposite him and gave him another hard look how much time did you spend with bella in england she asked just a few hours but ive been thinking about her ever since there was another pregnant pause then she said when she went to oxford bella was engaged to be married to victor rolandson a splendid young man she has known most of her life the rolandsons are old friends of my husbands and mine or at least they were until bella came home and broke off the engagement abruptly woodys heart leaped with hope she would only say she had realized she did not love victor i guessed shed met someone else and now i know who woody said i had no idea she was engaged she was wearing a diamond ring that was pretty hard to miss your poor powers of observation have caused a tragedy im very sorry woody said then he told himself to stop being a pussy or rather im not he said im very glad shes broken off her engagement because i think shes absolutely wonderful and i want her for myself mrs hernandez did not like that youre mighty fresh young man woody suddenly felt resentful of her condescension mrs hernandez you used the word tragedy just now my fiancée joanne died in my arms at pearl harbor my brother chuck was killed by machinegun fire on the beach at bougainville on dday i sent ace webber and four other young americans to their deaths for the sake of a bridge in a onehorse town called eglisedessoeurs i know what tragedy is maam and its not a broken engagement she was taken aback he guessed young people did not often stand up to her she did not reply but looked a little pale after a moment she got up and left the room without explanation woody was not sure what she expected him to do but he had not yet seen bella so he sat tight five minutes later bella came in woody stood up his pulse quickening just the sight of her made him smile she wore a plain paleyellow dress that set off her lustrous dark hair and coffee skin she would always look good in dramatically simple clothing he guessed just like joanne he wanted to put his arms around her and crush her soft body to his own but he waited for a sign from her she looked anxious and uncomfortable what are you doing here she said i came looking for you why because i cant get you out of my mind we dont even know each other lets put that right starting today will you have dinner with me i dont know he crossed the room to where she stood she was startled to see him using a walking stick what happened to you my knee got shot up in france its getting better slowly im so sorry bella i think youre wonderful i believe you like me were both free of commitments whats worrying you she gave that lopsided grin that he liked so much i guess im embarrassed about what i did that night in london is that all it was a lot for a first date that kind of thing went on all the time not to me necessarily but i heard about it you thought i was going to die she nodded ive never done anything like that not even with victor i dont know what came over me and in a public park i feel like a whore i know exactly what you are woody said youre a smart beautiful woman with a big heart so why dont we forget that mad moment in london and start getting to know one another like the respectable wellbroughtup young people that we are she began to soften can we really you bet okay ill pick you up at seven okay that was an exit line but he hesitated i cant tell you how glad i am that i found you again he said she looked him in the eye for the first time oh woody so am i she said so glad then she put her arms around his waist and hugged him it was what he had been longing for he embraced her and put his face into her wonderful hair they stayed like that for a long minute at last she pulled away ill see you at seven she said you bet he left the house in a cloud of happiness he went from there straight to a meeting of the steering committee in the veterans building next to the opera house there were fortysix members around the long table with aides such as gus dewar sitting behind them woody was an aide to an aide and sat up against the wall the soviet foreign minister molotov made the first speech he was not impressive to look at woody reflected with his receding hair neat moustache and glasses he looked like a store clerk which was what his father had been but he had survived a long time in bolshevik politics a friend of stalins since before the revolution he was the architect of the nazisoviet pact of he was a hard worker and was nicknamed stonearse because of the long hours he spent at his desk he proposed that belorussia and ukraine be admitted as original members of the united nations these two soviet republics had borne the brunt of the nazi invasion he pointed out and each had contributed more than a million men to the red army it had been argued that they were not fully independent of moscow but the same argument could be applied to canada and australia dominions of the british empire that had each been given separate membership the vote was unanimous it had all been fixed up in advance woody knew the latin american countries had threatened to dissent unless hitlersupporting argentina was admitted and that concession had been granted to secure their votes then came a bombshell the czech foreign minister jan masaryk stood up he was a famous liberal and antinazi who had been on the cover of time magazine in he proposed that poland should also be admitted to the un the americans were refusing to admit poland until stalin permitted elections there and masaryk as a democrat should have supported that stand especially as he too was trying to create a democracy with stalin looking over his shoulder molotov must have put terrific pressure on masaryk to get him to betray his ideals in this way and indeed when masaryk sat down he wore the expression of one who has eaten something disgusting gus dewar also looked grim the prearranged compromises over belorussia ukraine and argentina should have ensured that this session went smoothly but now molotov had thrown them a low ball senator vandenberg sitting with the american contingent was outraged he took out a pen and notepad and began writing furiously after a minute he tore the sheet off beckoned woody gave him the note and said take that to the secretary of state woody went to the table leaned over stettiniuss shoulder put the note in front of him and said from senator vandenberg sir thank you woody returned to his chair up against the wall my part in history he thought he had glanced at the note as he handed it over vandenberg had drafted a short passionate speech rejecting the czech proposal would stettinius follow the senators lead if molotov got his way over poland then vandenberg might sabotage the united nations in the senate but if stettinius took vandenbergs line now molotov might walk out and go home which would kill off the un just as effectively woody held his breath stettinius stood up with vandenbergs note in his hand weve just honoured our yalta engagements on behalf of russia he said he meant the commitment made by the usa to support belorussia and ukraine there are other yalta obligations which equally require allegiance he was using the words vandenberg had written one calls for a new and representative polish provisional government there was a murmur of shock around the room stettinius was going up against molotov woody glanced at vandenberg he was purring until that happens stettinius went on the conference cannot in good conscience recognize the lublin government he looked directly at molotov and quoted vandenbergs exact words it would be a sordid exhibition of bad faith molotov looked incandescent the british foreign secretary anthony eden unfolded his lanky figure and stood up to support stettinius his tone was faultlessly courteous but his words were scathing my government has no way of knowing whether the polish people support their provisional government he said because our soviet allies refuse to let british observers into poland woody sensed the meeting turning against molotov the russian clearly had the same impression he was conferring with his aides loudly enough for woody to hear the fury in his voice but would he walk out the belgian foreign minister bald and podgy with a double chin proposed a compromise a motion expressing the hope that the new polish government might be organized in time to be represented here in san francisco before the end of the conference everyone looked at molotov he was being offered a facesaver but would he accept it he still looked angry however he gave a slight but unmistakable nod of assent and the crisis was over well woody thought two victories in one day things are looking up v carla went out to queue for water there had been no water in the taps for two days luckily berlins housewives had discovered that every few blocks there were oldfashioned street pumps long disused connected to underground wells they were rusty and creaky but amazingly they still worked so every morning now the women stood in line holding their buckets and jugs the air raids had stopped presumably because the enemy was on the point of entering the city but it was still dangerous to be on the street because the red armys artillery was shelling carla was not sure why they bothered much of the city had gone whole blocks and even larger areas had been completely flattened all utilities were cut off no trains or buses ran thousands were homeless perhaps millions the city was one huge refugee camp but the shelling went on most people spent all day in their cellars or in public airraid shelters but they had to come out for water on the radio shortly before the electricity went off permanently the bbc had announced that the sachsenhausen concentration camp had been liberated by the red army sachsenhausen was north of berlin so clearly the soviets coming from the east were encircling the city instead of marching straight in carlas mother maud deduced that the russians wanted to keep out the american british french and canadian forces rapidly approaching from the west she had quoted lenin who controls berlin controls germany and who controls germany controls europe yet the german army had not given up outnumbered outgunned short of ammunition and fuel and half starved they slogged on again and again their leaders hurled them at overwhelming enemy forces and again and again they obeyed orders fought with spirit and courage and died in their hundreds of thousands among them were the two men carla loved her brother erik and her boyfriend werner she had no idea where they were fighting or even whether they were alive carla had wound up the spy ring the fighting was deteriorating into chaos battle plans meant little secret intelligence from berlin was of small value to the conquering soviets it was no longer worth the risk the spies had burned their code books and hidden their radio transmitters in the rubble of bombed buildings they had agreed never to speak of their work they had been brave they had shortened the war and they had saved lives but it was too much to expect the defeated german people to see things that way their courage would remain forever secret while carla waited her turn at the tap a hitler youth tankhunting squad went past heading east towards the fighting there were two men in their fifties and a dozen teenage boys all on bicycles strapped to the front of each bicycle were two of the new oneshot antitank weapons called panzerfäuste the uniforms were too large for the boys and their oversize helmets would have looked comical if their plight had not been so pathetic they were off to fight the red army they were going to die carla looked away as they passed she did not want to remember their faces as she was filling her bucket the woman behind her in line frau reichs spoke to her quietly so that no one else could hear youre a friend of the doctors wife arent you carla tensed frau reichs was obviously talking about hannelore rothmann the doctor had disappeared along with the mental patients from the jewish hospital hannelores son rudi had thrown away his yellow star and joined those jews living clandestinely called uboats in berlin slang but hannelore not herself jewish was still at the old house for twelve years a question such as the one just asked are you a friend of a jews wife had been an accusation what was it today carla did not know frau reichs was only a nodding acquaintance she could not be trusted carla turned off the tap dr rothmann was our family physician when i was a child she said guardedly why the other woman took her place at the standpipe and began to fill a large can that had once held cooking oil frau rothmann has been taken away she said i thought youd like to know it was commonplace people were taken away all the time but when it happened to someone close to you it came as a blow to the heart there was no point in trying to find out what had happened to them in fact it was downright dangerous people who inquired about disappearances tended to disappear themselves all the same carla had to ask do you know where they took her this time there was an answer the schulstrasse transit camp carla felt hopeful its in the old jewish hospital in wedding do you know it yes i do carla sometimes worked at the hospital unofficially and illegally so she knew that the government had taken over one of the hospital buildings the pathology lab and surrounded it with barbed wire i hope shes all right said the other woman she was good to me when my steffi was ill she turned off the tap and walked away with her can of water carla hurried away in the opposite direction heading for home she had to do something about hannelore it had always been nearly impossible to get anyone out of a camp but now that everything was breaking down perhaps there might be a way she took the bucket into the house and gave it to ada maud had gone to queue for food rations carla changed into her nurses uniform thinking it might help she explained to ada where she was going and left again she had to walk to wedding it was two or three miles she wondered if it was worth it even if she found hannelore she probably would not be able to help her but then she thought of eva in london and rudi in hiding somewhere here in berlin how terrible it would be if they lost their mother in the last hours of the war she had to try the military police were on the streets stopping people and demanding papers they worked in threes forming summary courts and were mainly interested in men of fighting age they did not bother carla in her nurses uniform it was strange that in this blasted cityscape the apple and cherry trees were gorgeous with white and pink blossoms and that in the quiet moments between explosions she could hear the birds singing as optimistically as they did every spring to her horror she saw several men hanged from lamp posts some in uniform most of the bodies had a card hanging around the neck saying coward or deserter these had been found guilty by those threeman street courts she knew was there not already enough killing to satisfy the nazis it made her want to weep she was forced to take shelter from artillery bombardments three times on the last occasion when she was only a few hundred yards from the hospital the soviets and the germans seemed to be fighting only a few streets away the shooting was so heavy that carla was tempted to turn back hannelore was probably doomed and might already be dead why should carla add her own life to the toll but she went on anyway it was evening when she reached her destination the hospital was in iranische strasse on the corner of schul strasse the trees lining the streets were in new leaf the laboratory building which had been turned into a transit camp was guarded carla considered going up to the guard and explaining her mission but it seemed an unpromising strategy she wondered if she might slip inside from the tunnel system she went into the main building the hospital was functioning all the patients had been moved into the basements and tunnels the staff were working by the light of oil lamps carla could tell by the smell that the toilets were not flushing water was being carried in buckets from an old well in the garden surprisingly soldiers were bringing wounded comrades in for help suddenly they did not care that the doctors and nurses might be jewish she followed a tunnel under the garden to the basement of the laboratory as she expected the door was guarded however the young gestapo man looked at her uniform and waved her through without questioning her perhaps he no longer saw any point in his job she was inside the camp now she wondered whether it would be as easy to get out the smell here was worse and she soon saw why the basement was overcrowded hundreds of people were packed into four storerooms they sat or lay on the floor the lucky ones having a wall to lean against they were dirty smelly and exhausted and they looked at her with dull uninterested gazes she found hannelore after a few minutes the doctors wife had never been beautiful but she had once been a statuesque woman with a strong face now she was gaunt like most people and her hair was grey and lifeless she was hollowcheeked and lined with strain she was talking to an adolescent who was at the age when a girl can seem too voluptuous for her years having womanly breasts and hips but the face of a child the girl was sitting on the floor crying and hannelore was kneeling beside her holding her hand and speaking in a low soothing voice when hannelore saw carla she stood up saying good god why are you in here i thought maybe if i tell them youre not jewish they might let you go that was brave your husband saved many lives someone ought to save yours for a moment carla thought hannelore was going to cry her face seemed about to crumple then she blinked and shook her head this is rebecca rosen she said in a controlled voice her parents were killed by a shell today carla said im so sorry rebecca the girl did not speak carla said how old are you rebecca nearly fourteen youre going to have to be a grownup now why didnt i die too rebecca said i was right beside them i should have died now im all alone youre not alone carla said briskly were with you she turned back to hannelore whos in charge here his name is walter dobberke im going to tell him he must let you go hes left for the day and his secondincommand is a sergeant with the brains of a warthog but look here comes gisela shes dobberkes mistress the young woman walking into the room was pretty with long fair hair and creamy skin no one looked at her she wore a defiant expression hannelore said she has sex with him on the bed in the electrocardiogram room upstairs she gets extra food in exchange no one will speak to her except me i just dont think we can judge people for the compromises they make we are living in hell after all carla was not so sure she would not befriend a jewish girl who slept with a nazi gisela met hannelores eye and came over hes had new orders she said speaking so quietly that carla had to strain to hear her then she hesitated hannelore said well what are the orders giselas voice fell to a whisper to shoot everyone here carla felt a cold hand grasp her heart all these people including hannelore and young rebecca walter doesnt want to do it gisela said hes not a bad man really hannelore spoke with fatalistic calm when is he supposed to kill us immediately but he wants to destroy the records first hanspeter and martin are putting the files into the furnace right now its a long job so we have a few hours left maybe the red army will get here in time to save us and maybe they wont hannelore said crisply is there any way we can persuade him to disobey his orders for gods sake the war is almost over i used to be able to talk him into anything gisela said sadly but hes getting tired of me now you know what men are like but he should be thinking of his own future any day now the allies will be in charge here they will punish nazi crimes gisela said if were all dead whos going to accuse him i will said carla the other two stared at her not speaking carla realized that even though she was not jewish she too would be shot to prevent her bearing witness casting about for ideas she said perhaps if dobberke spared us it would help him with the allies thats a thought said hannelore we could all sign a declaration saying that he saved our lives carla looked enquiringly at gisela her expression was dubious but she said he might do it hannelore looked around theres hilde she said she acts as a secretary for dobberke she called the woman over and explained the plan ill type out release documents for everyone hilde said well ask him to sign them before we give him the declaration there were no guards within the basement area just at the groundfloor door and the tunnel so the prisoners could move around freely inside hilde went into the room that served as dobberkes underground office she typed the declaration first hannelore and carla went around the basement explaining the plan and getting everyone to sign meanwhile hilde typed the release documents by the time they finished it was the middle of the night there was no more they could do until dobberke showed up in the morning carla lay on the floor next to rebecca rosen there was nowhere else to sleep after a while rebecca began to cry quietly carla was not sure what to do she wanted to give comfort but no words came what did you say to a child who had just seen both her parents killed the muffled weeping continued in the end carla rolled over and put her arms around rebecca she knew immediately that she had done the right thing rebecca cuddled up to her head on her breast carla patted her back as if she were a baby slowly the sobs eased and eventually rebecca fell asleep carla did not sleep she spent the night making imaginary speeches to the camp commandant sometimes she appealed to his better nature sometimes she threatened him with allied justice sometimes she argued from his own selfinterest she tried not to think about the process of being shot erik had explained to her how the nazis executed people twelve at a time in russia she supposed they would have an efficient system here too it was hard to imagine perhaps that was just as well she could probably escape shooting if she left the camp right now or first thing in the morning she was not an inmate nor a jew and her papers were perfectly in order she could go out the way she came in dressed in her nurses uniform but that would mean abandoning both hannelore and rebecca she could not bring herself to do that no matter how badly she longed to get out of here the fighting in the streets outside continued until the small hours then there was a short pause it began again at dawn now it was close enough for her to hear machinegun fire as well as artillery early in the morning the guards brought an urn of watery soup and a sack of bread all discarded parts of stale loaves carla drank the soup and ate the bread and then reluctantly used the toilet which was unspeakably dirty with hannelore gisela and hilde she went up to the ground floor to wait for dobberke the shelling had resumed and they were in danger every second but they wanted to confront him the moment he arrived he did not appear at his usual hour he was normally punctual hilde said perhaps he had been delayed by the fighting in the streets he might have been killed of course carla hoped not his secondincommand sergeant ehrenstein was too stupid to argue with when dobberke was an hour late carla began to lose hope after another hour he arrived whats this he said when he saw the four women waiting in the hall a mothers meeting hannelore replied all the prisoners have signed a declaration saying you saved their lives it may save your life if you accept our terms dont be ridiculous he said carla spoke up according to the bbc the united nations has a list of the names of nazi officers who have taken part in mass murders in a weeks time you could be on trial wouldnt you like to have a signed declaration that you spared people listening to the bbc is a crime he said though not as serious as murder hilde had a file folder in her hand she said i have typed release orders for all the prisoners here if you sign them you can have the declaration i could just take it from you no one will believe in your innocence if were all dead dobberke was angered by the situation he found himself in but not confident enough just to walk away i could shoot the four of you for insolence he said carla spoke impatiently this is what defeat is like she said get used to it his face darkened with anger and she realized she had gone too far she wished she could take back her words she stared at dobberkes furious expression trying not to let her fear show at that moment a shell landed outside the building the doors rattled and a window smashed they all ducked instinctively but no one was hurt when they straightened up dobberkes face had changed rage was replaced by something like disgusted resignation carlas heartbeat quickened had he given up sergeant ehrenstein ran in no one hurt sir he reported very good sergeant ehrenstein was about to go out again when dobberke called him back this camp is now closed dobberke said carla held her breath closed sir there was aggression as well as surprise in the sergeants voice new orders tell the men to go dobberke hesitated tell them to report to the railway bunker at freidrich strasse station carla knew dobberke was making this up and ehrenstein seemed to suspect it too when sir immediately immediately ehrenstein paused as if the word immediately required further elucidation dobberke stared him out very good sir said the sergeant ill tell the men he went out carla felt a surge of triumph but told herself she was not yet free dobberke said to hilde show me the declaration hilde opened her folder there were a dozen sheets all with the same wording typed at the top the rest of the space covered with signatures she handed them over dobberke folded the papers and stuffed them in his pocket hilde placed the release orders in front of him sign these please you dont need release orders dobberke said and i dont have time to sign my name hundreds of times he stood up carla said the police are on the streets theyre hanging people from the lamp posts we need papers he patted his pocket theyll hang me if they find this declaration he went to the door gisela cried take me with you walter he turned to her take you he said what would my wife say he went out and slammed the door gisela burst into tears carla went to the door opened it and watched dobberke stride away there were no other gestapo men in sight they had already obeyed his orders and abandoned the camp the commandant reached the street and broke into a run he left the gate open hannelore was standing beside carla looking out with incredulity were free i think said carla we must tell the others hilde said ill tell them she went down the basement stairs carla and hannelore walked fearfully along the path that led from the laboratory entrance to the open gate there they hesitated and looked at one another hannelore said were frightened of freedom behind them a girlish voice said carla dont go without me it was rebecca running down the path her breasts bouncing under a grubby blouse carla sighed ive acquired a child she thought i dont feel ready to be a mother but what can i do come on then she said but be ready to run she realized she did not need to worry about rebeccas agility the girl could undoubtedly run faster than either carla or hannelore they crossed the hospital garden to the main gate there they paused and looked up and down iranische strasse it seemed quiet they crossed the road and ran to the corner as carla looked along schul strasse she heard a burst of machinegun fire and saw that farther up the street there was a firefight she saw german troops retreating towards her and red army soldiers coming after them she looked around there was nowhere to hide except behind trees and that was hardly any protection at all a shell landed in the middle of the road fifty yards away and exploded carla felt the blast but she was not hurt without conferring all three women ran back inside the hospital grounds they returned to the laboratory building some of the other prisoners were standing just inside the barbed wire as if not quite daring to come out carla said to them the basement stinks but right now its the safest place she went inside the building and down the stairs and most of the others followed she wondered how long she would have to stay here the german army must give up but when somehow she could not imagine hitler agreeing to surrender under any circumstances the mans whole life had been based on arrogantly shouting that he was the boss how could such a man admit that he had been wrong stupid and wicked that he had murdered millions and caused his country to be bombed to ruins that he would go down in history as the most evil man who had ever lived he could not he would go mad or die of shame or put a pistol in his mouth and pull the trigger but how long would it take another day another week longer there was a shout from upstairs theyre here the russians are here then carla heard heavy boots clattering down the steps where had the russians got such good boots from the americans then they were in the room four six eight nine men with dirty faces carrying submachine guns with drum magazines ready to kill as quick as look at you they seemed to take up a lot of room people shrank away from them even though they were the liberators the soldiers took in their surroundings they saw that they were in no danger from the emaciated prisoners mainly female they lowered their guns some moved into the adjoining rooms a tall soldier pulled up his left sleeve he was wearing six or seven wristwatches he shouted something in russian pointing at the watches with the stock of his gun carla thought she knew what he was saying but she could hardly believe it the man then grabbed an elderly woman took her hand and pointed to her wedding ring hannelore said are they going to rob us of what little the nazis didnt steal they were the tall soldier looked frustrated and tried to pull off the womans ring when she realized what he wanted she took it off herself and gave it to him the russian took it nodded then pointed all around the room hannelore stepped forward these people are prisoners she said in german jews and families of jews persecuted by the nazis whether he understood her or not he took no notice but just pointed insistently at the watches on his arm those few who had any valuables that had not been stolen or traded for food handed them over liberation by the red army was not going to be the happy event many people had been looking forward to but there was worse to come the tall soldier pointed at rebecca she cringed away from him and tried to hide behind carla a second man small with fair hair grabbed rebecca and pulled her away rebecca screamed and the small man grinned as if he liked the sound carla had a dreadful feeling she knew what was going to happen next the short man held rebecca firmly while the tall man squeezed her breasts roughly then said something that made them both laugh there were cries of protest from the people all around the tall man levelled his gun carla was terrified he would fire he would kill and wound dozens of people if he pulled the trigger of a submachine gun in a crowded room everyone else realized the danger and they went quiet the two soldiers backed towards the door taking rebecca with them she yelled and struggled but she could not break the small soldiers grip when they reached the door carla stepped forward and cried wait something in her voice made them stop shes too young carla said only thirteen she did not know whether they understood her she held up two hands showing ten fingers then one hand showing three thirteen the tall soldier seemed to understand her he grinned and said in german frau ist frau a woman is a woman carla found herself saying you need a real woman she walked slowly forward take me instead she tried to smile seductively im not a child i know what to do she came close close enough to smell the rank odour of a man who had not bathed for months trying to conceal her distaste she lowered her voice and said i understand what a man wants she touched her own breast suggestively forget the child the tall soldier looked again at rebecca her eyes were red with weeping and her nose was running which helpfully made her look more like a child less like a woman he looked back at carla she said theres a bed upstairs shall i show you where again she was not sure he understood the words but she took him by the hand and he followed her up the steps to the ground floor the fair one let go of rebecca and came after now that she had succeeded carla regretted her bravado she wanted to break away from the russians and run but they would probably shoot her down then go back to rebecca carla thought of the devastated child who had lost both parents yesterday to be raped the next day would surely destroy her spirit for ever carla had to save her i will not be smashed by this carla thought i can live through it i will be myself again afterwards she led them to the electrocardiogram room she felt cold as if her heart were freezing and her thoughts becoming sluggish next to the bed was a can of the grease used by the doctors to improve the conductivity of the terminals she pulled off her underpants then took a large dob of grease and pushed it into her vagina that might save her from bleeding she had to keep her act up she turned back to the two soldiers to her horror three more followed them into the room she tried to smile but she could not she lay on her back and parted her legs the tall one knelt between her knees he ripped open her uniform blouse to expose her breasts she could see that he was manipulating himself making his penis erect he lay on top and entered her she told herself this had no connection with what she and werner had done together she turned her head to the side but the soldier grasped her chin and turned her face back making her look at him as he thrust inside her she closed her eyes she felt him kissing her trying to force his tongue into her mouth his breath smelled like rotting meat when she clamped her mouth shut he punched her face she cried out and opened her bruised lips to him she tried to think how much worse this would have been for a thirteenyearold virgin the soldier grunted and ejaculated inside her she tried not to let her disgust show on her face he climbed off and the fairhaired one took his place carla tried to close down her mind to make her body into something detached a machine an object that had nothing to do with her this one did not want to kiss her but he sucked her breasts and bit her nipples and when she cried out in pain he seemed pleased and did it harder time passed and he ejaculated then another one got on top she realized that when this was over she would not be able to bathe or shower for there was no running water in the city that thought pushed her over the top their fluids would be inside her their smell would be on her skin their saliva in her mouth and she would have no effective way to wash somehow that was worse than everything else her courage failed her and she started to cry the third soldier satisfied himself then the fourth lay on her ii adolf hitler killed himself on monday april in his bunker in berlin exactly a week later in london at twenty to eight in the evening the ministry of information announced that germany had surrendered a holiday was declared for the following day tuesday may daisy sat at the window of her apartment in piccadilly watching the celebrations the street was thronged with people making it almost impassable to cars and buses the girls would kiss any man in uniform and thousands of lucky servicemen were taking full advantage by early afternoon many people were drunk through the open window daisy could hear distant singing and guessed that the crowd outside buckingham palace was singing land of hope and glory she shared their happiness but lloyd was somewhere in france or germany and he was the only soldier she wanted to kiss she prayed he had not been killed in the last few hours of the war lloyds sister millie showed up with her two children millies husband abe avery was also with the army somewhere she and the children had come to the west end to join in the celebrations and they took a break from the crowds at daisys place the leckwith home in aldgate had long been a place of refuge for daisy and she was glad to have a chance to reciprocate she made tea for millie her staff were out there celebrating and poured orange juice for the children lennie was five now and pammie three since abe had been conscripted millie had been running his leather wholesaling business his sister naomi avery was the bookkeeper but millie did the selling its going to change now millie said for the past five years the demand has been for tough hides for boots and shoes now were going to need softer leathers calf and pigskin for handbags and briefcases when the luxury market comes back therell be decent money to be made at last daisy recalled that her father had the same way of thinking as millie lev too was always looking ahead searching out the opportunities eva murray appeared next with her four children in tow jamie aged eight organized a game of hideandseek and the apartment became like a kindergarten evas husband jimmy now a colonel was also somewhere in france or germany and eva was suffering the same agonies of anxiety as daisy and millie well hear from them any day now millie said and then it will really be all over eva was also desperate for news of her family in berlin however she thought it might be weeks or months before anyone could learn the fates of individual germans in the postwar chaos i wonder whether my children will ever know my parents she said sadly at five oclock daisy made a pitcher of martinis millie went into the kitchen and with characteristic speed and efficiency produced a plate of sardines on toast to eat with the drinks eth and bernie arrived just as daisy was making a second round bernie told daisy that lennie could read already and pammie could sing the national anthem ethel said typical grandfather thinks there have never been bright children before but daisy could tell that in her heart she was just as proud of them feeling relaxed and happy halfway down her second martini she looked around at the disparate group gathered in her home they had paid her the compliment of coming to her door without an invitation knowing they would be welcomed they belonged to her and she to them they were she realized her family she felt very blessed ii woody dewar sat outside leo shapiros office looking through a sheaf of photographs they were the pictures he had taken at pearl harbor in the hour before joanne died the film had stayed in his camera for months but eventually he had developed it and printed the pictures looking at them had made him so sad that he had put them in a drawer in his bedroom at the washington apartment and left them there but this was a time for change he would never forget joanne but he was in love again at last he adored bella and she felt the same when they parted at the oakland train station outside san francisco he had told her that he loved her and she had said i love you too he was going to ask her to marry him he would have done so already but it seemed too soon less than three months and he did not want to give her hostile parents a pretext for objecting also he needed to make a decision about his future he did not want to go into politics this was going to shock his parents he knew they had always assumed he would follow in his fathers footsteps and end up as the third senator dewar he had gone along with this assumption unthinkingly but in the war and especially while in hospital he had asked himself what he really wanted to do if he survived and the answer was not politics this was a good time to leave his father had achieved his lifes ambition the senate had debated the united nations it was at a similar point in history that the old league of nations had foundered a painful memory for gus dewar but senator vandenberg had spoken passionately in favour speaking of the dearest dream of mankind and the un charter had been ratified by eightynine votes to two the job was done woody would not be letting his father down by quitting now he hoped gus would see it that way too shapiro opened his office door and beckoned woody stood up and went in shapiro was younger than woody had expected somewhere in his thirties he was washington bureau chief for the national press agency he sat behind his desk and said what can i do for senator dewars son id like to show you some photographs if i may all right woody spread his pictures on shapiros desk is this pearl harbor shapiro said yes december seventh my god woody was looking at them upsidedown but still they brought tears to his eyes there was joanne looking so beautiful and chuck grinning happily to be with his family and eddie then the planes coming over the bombs and torpedoes dropping from their bellies the blacksmoke explosions on the ships and the sailors scrambling over the sides dropping into the sea swimming for their lives this is your father shapiro said and your mother i recognize them and my fiancée who died a few minutes later my brother who was killed at bougainville and my brothers best friend these are fantastic photographs how much do you want for them i dont want money woody said shapiro looked up in surprise woody said i want a job iii fifteen days after ve day winston churchill called a general election the leckwith family were taken by surprise like most people ethel and bernie had thought churchill would wait until the japanese surrendered the labour leader clement attlee had suggested an election in october churchill wrongfooted them all major lloyd williams was released from the army to stand as labour candidate for hoxton in the east end of london he was full of eager enthusiasm for the future envisioned by his party fascism had been vanquished and now british people could create a society that combined freedom with welfare labour had a wellthoughtout plan for avoiding the catastrophes of the last twenty years universal comprehensive unemployment insurance to help families through hard times economic planning to prevent another depression and a united nations organization to keep the peace you dont stand a chance said his stepfather bernie in the kitchen of the house in aldgate on monday june bernies pessimism was the more convincing for being so uncharacteristic theyll vote tory because churchill won the war he went on gloomily it was the same with lloyd george in lloyd was about to reply but daisy got in first the war wasnt won by the free market and capitalist enterprise she said indignantly it was people working together and sharing the burdens everybody doing his bit thats socialism lloyd loved her most when she was passionate but he was more deliberate we already have measures that the old tories would have condemned as bolshevism government control of railways mines and shipping for example all brought in by churchill and ernie bevin has been in charge of economic planning all through the war bernie shook his head knowingly an oldman gesture that irritated lloyd people vote with their hearts not brains he said theyll want to show their gratitude well no point sitting here arguing with you lloyd said im going to argue with voters instead he and daisy took a bus a few stops north to the black lion pub in shoreditch where they met up with a canvassing team from the hoxton constituency labour party in fact canvassing was not about arguing with voters lloyd knew its main purpose was to identify supporters so that on election day the party machine could make sure they all went to the polling station firm labour supporters were noted firm supporters of other parties were crossed off only people who had not yet made up their minds were worth more than a few seconds they were offered the chance to speak to the candidate lloyd got some negative reactions major eh one woman said my alf is a corporal he says the officers nearly lost us the war there were also accusations of nepotism arent you the son of the mp for aldgate what is this a hereditary monarchy he remembered his mothers advice you never win a vote by proving the constituent a fool be charming be modest and dont lose your temper if a voter is hostile and rude thank him for his time and go away youll leave him thinking maybe he misjudged you workingclass voters were strongly labour a lot of people told lloyd that attlee and bevin had done a good job during the war the waverers were mostly middleclass when people said that churchill had won the war lloyd quoted attlees gentle putdown it wasnt a oneman government and it wasnt a oneman war churchill had described attlee as a modest man with much to be modest about attlees wit was less brutal and for that reason more effective at least lloyd thought so a couple of constituents mentioned the sitting mp for hoxton a liberal and said they would vote for him because he had helped them solve some problem members of parliament were often called upon by constituents who felt they were being treated unjustly by the government an employer or a neighbour it was timeconsuming work but it won votes overall lloyd could not tell which way public opinion was leaning only one constituent mentioned daisy the man came to the door with his mouth full of food lloyd said good evening mr perkinson i understand you wanted to ask me something your fiancée was a fascist the man said chewing lloyd guessed he had been reading the daily mail which had run a spiteful story about lloyd and daisy under the headline the socialist and the viscountess lloyd nodded she was briefly fooled by fascism like many others how can a socialist marry a fascist lloyd looked around spotted daisy and beckoned her mr perkinson here is asking me about my fiancée being an exfascist pleased to meet you mr perkinson daisy shook the mans hand i quite understand your concern my first husband was a fascist in the thirties and i supported him perkinson nodded he probably believed a wife should take her views from her husband how foolish we were daisy went on but when the war came my first husband joined the raf and fought against the nazis as bravely as anyone is that a fact last year he was flying a typhoon over france strafing a german troop train when he was shot down and killed so im a war widow perkinson swallowed his food im sorry to hear that of course but daisy had not finished for myself i lived in london throughout the war i drove an ambulance all through the blitz very brave of you im sure well i just hope you think that my late husband and i both paid our dues i dont know about that perkinson said sulkily we wont take up any more of your time said lloyd thank you for explaining your views to me good evening as they walked away daisy said i dont think we won him round you never do lloyd said but hes seen both sides of the story now which might make him a bit less vociferous about it later this evening when he talks about us in the pub hmm lloyd sensed he had failed to reassure daisy canvassing finished early for tonight the first of the radio election broadcasts would be aired on the bbc and all party workers would be listening churchill had the privilege of making the first one on the bus home daisy said im worried im an election liability to you no candidate is perfect lloyd said its how you deal with your weaknesses that matters i dont want to be your weakness perhaps i should stay out of the way on the contrary i want everyone to know all about you from the start if you are a liability i will get out of politics no no id hate to think i made you give up your ambitions it wont come to that he said but once again he could see that he had not succeeded in assuaging her anxiety back in nutley street the leckwith family sat around the radio in the kitchen daisy held lloyds hand i came here a lot while you were away she said we used to listen to swing music and talk about you the thought made lloyd feel very lucky churchill came on the familiar rasp was stirring for five grim years that voice had given people strength and hope and courage lloyd felt despairing even he was tempted to vote for this man my friends the prime minister said i must tell you that a socialist policy is abhorrent to the british ideas of freedom well that was routine knockabout stuff all new ideas were condemned as foreign imports but what would churchill offer people labour had a plan but what did the conservatives propose socialism is inseparably interwoven with totalitarianism churchill said lloyds mother ethel said surely hes not going to pretend were like the nazis i think he is though bernie said hell say weve defeated the enemy abroad now we must defeat the enemy in our midst standard conservative tactic people wont believe that ethel said lloyd said hush churchill said a socialist state once thoroughly completed in all its details and its aspects could not afford to suffer opposition this is outrageous said ethel but i will go farther said churchill i declare to you from the bottom of my heart that no socialist system can be established without a political police political police ethel said indignantly where is he getting this stuff from bernie said this is good in a way he cant find anything to criticize in our manifesto therefore hes attacking us for things we arent actually proposing to do bloody liar lloyd shouted listen churchill said they would have to fall back on some form of gestapo suddenly they were all on their feet shouting protests the prime minister was drowned out bastard bernie yelled shaking his fist at the marconi radio set bastard bastard when they had quietened down ethel said is that going to be their campaign just lies about us it bloody well is said bernie lloyd said but will people believe it iv in southern new mexico not far from el paso there is a desert called jornada del muerto the voyage of the dead all day long the cruel sun beats down on needlethorn mesquite and swordleafed yucca plants the inhabitants are scorpions and rattlesnakes fire ants and tarantula spiders here the men of the manhattan project tested the most dreadful weapon the human race had ever devised greg peshkov was with the scientists watching from ten thousand yards away he had two hopes first that the bomb would work and second that ten thousand yards was far enough the countdown started at nine minutes past five in the morning mountain war time on monday july it was dawn and there were streaks of gold in the sky to the east the test was codenamed trinity when greg had asked why the senior scientist the pointyeared jewish new yorker j robert oppenheimer had quoted a poem by john donne batter my heart threepersond god oppie was the cleverest person greg had ever met the most brilliant physicist of his generation he also spoke six languages he had read karl marxs capital in the original german the kind of thing he did for fun was learn sanskrit greg liked and admired him most physicists were geeks but oppie like greg himself was an exception tall handsome charming and a real ladykiller in the middle of the desert oppie had instructed the army corps of engineers to build a onehundredfoot tower of steel struts in concrete footings on top was an oak platform the bomb had been winched up to the platform on saturday the scientists never used the word bomb they called it the gadget at its heart was a ball of plutonium a metal that did not exist in nature but was created as a byproduct in nuclear piles the ball weighed ten pounds and contained all the plutonium in the world someone had calculated that it was worth a billion dollars thirtytwo detonators on the surface of the ball would go off simultaneously creating such powerful inward pressure that the plutonium would become more dense and go critical no one really knew what would happen next the scientists were running a betting pool dollar a ticket on the force of the explosion measured in equivalent tons of tnt edward teller bet tons oppie bet tons the official forecast was tons the night before enrico fermi had offered to take side bets on whether the blast would wipe out the entire state of new mexico general groves had not found it funny the scientists had had a perfectly serious discussion about whether the explosion would ignite the atmosphere of the entire earth and destroy the planet but they had come to the conclusion that it would not if they were wrong greg just hoped it would happen fast the trial had originally been scheduled for july however every time they tested a component it failed so the big day had been postponed several times back at los alamos on saturday a mockup they called the chinese copy had refused to ignite in the betting pool norman ramsey had picked zero gambling that the bomb would be a dud today detonation had been scheduled for am but at that time there had been a thunderstorm in the desert rain would bring the radioactive fallout down on the heads of the watching scientists so the blast was postponed the storm had ended at dawn greg was at a bunker called s which was the control room like most of the scientists he was standing outside for a better view hope and fear struggled for mastery of his heart if the bomb was a dud the efforts of hundreds of people plus about two billion dollars would have gone for nothing and if the bomb was not a dud they might all be killed in the next few minutes beside him was wilhelm frunze the young german scientist he had first met in chicago what would have happened will if lightning had struck the bomb frunze shrugged no one knows a green verey rocket shot into the sky startling greg fiveminute warning frunze said security had been haphazard santa fe the nearest town to los alamos was crawling with welldressed fbi agents leaning nonchalantly against walls in their tweed jackets and neckties they were obvious to local residents who wore blue jeans and cowboy boots the bureau was also illegally tapping the phones of hundreds of people involved in the manhattan project this bewildered greg how could the nations premier law enforcement agency systematically commit criminal acts nevertheless army security and the fbi had identified some spies and quietly removed them from the project including barney mchugh but had they found them all greg did not know groves had been forced to take risks if he had fired everyone the fbi asked him to there would not have been enough scientists left to build the bomb unfortunately most scientists were radicals socialists and liberals there was hardly a conservative among them and they believed that the truths discovered by science were for humankind to share and should never be kept secret in the service of one regime or country so while the american government was keeping this huge project top secret the scientists held discussion groups about sharing nuclear technology with all the nations of the world oppie himself was suspect the only reason he was not in the communist party was that he never joined clubs right now oppie was lying on the ground next to his kid brother frank also an outstanding physicist also a communist they both held pieces of welding glass through which to observe the explosion greg and frunze had similar pieces of glass some of the scientists were wearing sunglasses another rocket went off one minute said frunze greg heard oppie say lord these affairs are hard on the heart he wondered if those would be oppies last words greg and frunze lay on the sandy earth near oppie and frank they all held their visors of welding glass in front of their eyes and gazed towards the test site facing death greg thought about his mother his father and his sister daisy in london he wondered how much they would miss him he thought with mild regret of margaret cowdry who had dumped him for a guy who was willing to marry her but most of all he thought of jacky jakes and his son georgy now nine years old he passionately wanted to watch georgy grow up he realized georgy was the main reason he was hoping to stay alive stealthily the child had crept into his soul and stolen his love the strength of this feeling surprised greg a gong chimed a strangely inappropriate sound in the desert ten seconds greg suffered an impulse to get up and run away silly though it was how far could he get in ten seconds he had to force himself to lie still the bomb went off at five twentynine and fortyfive seconds first there was an awesome flash impossibly bright the fiercest glare greg had ever seen stronger than the sun then a weird dome of fire seemed to come out of the ground with terrifying speed it grew monstrously high it reached the level of the mountains and continued to rise rapidly dwarfing the peaks greg whispered jesus the dome morphed into a square the light was still brighter than noonday and the distant mountains were so vividly illuminated that greg could see every fold and crevice and rock then the shape changed again a pillar appeared below seeming to push miles into the sky like the fist of god the cloud of boiling fire above the pillar spread like an umbrella until the whole thing looked like a mushroom seven miles tall the colours in the cloud were hellish orange green and purple greg was hit by a wave of heat as if the almighty had opened a giant oven at the same moment the bang of the explosion reached his ears like the crack of doom but that was only the beginning a noise like supernaturally loud thunder rolled over the desert drowning all other sound the blazing cloud began to diminish but the thunder went on and on impossibly sustained until greg wondered if this was the sound of the end of the world at last it faded away and the mushroom cloud began to disperse greg heard frank oppenheimer say it worked oppie said yes it worked the two brothers shook hands and the world is still here greg thought but it has been forever changed v lloyd williams and daisy went to hoxton town hall on the morning of july to watch the votes being counted if lloyd lost daisy was going to break off the engagement he fervently denied that she was a political liability but she knew better lloyds political enemies made a point of calling her lady aberowen voters reacted to her american accent by looking indignant as if she had no right to take part in british politics even labour party members treated her differently asking if she would prefer coffee when they were all drinking tea as lloyd had forecast she was often able to overcome peoples initial hostility by being natural and charming and helping the other women wash up the tea cups but was that enough the election results would give the only definite answer she was not going to marry him if it meant his giving up his lifes work he said he was willing to do it but it was a hopeless foundation for marriage daisy shuddered with horror as she imagined him doing some other job working at a bank or in the civil service miserably unhappy and trying to pretend it was not her fault it did not bear thinking about unfortunately everyone thought the conservatives were going to win the election some things had gone labours way in the campaign churchills gestapo speech had backfired even conservatives had been dismayed clement attlee broadcasting the following evening for labour had been coolly ironic when i listened to the prime ministers speech last night in which he gave such a travesty of the policy of the labour party i realized at once what was his object he wanted the voters to understand how great was the difference between winston churchill the great leader in war of a united nation and mr churchill the party leader of the conservatives he feared lest those who had accepted his leadership in war might be tempted out of gratitude to follow him further i thank him for having disillusioned them so thoroughly attlees magisterial disdain had made churchill seem a rabblerouser people had had too much of bloodred passion daisy thought they would surely prefer temperate common sense in peacetime a gallup poll taken the day before voting showed labour winning but no one believed it the idea that you could forecast the result by asking a small number of electors seemed a bit unlikely the news chronicle which had published the poll was predicting a tie all the other papers said the conservatives would win daisy had never before taken any interest in the mechanics of democracy but her fate was in the balance now and she watched mesmerized as the voting papers were taken out of the boxes sorted counted bundled and counted again the man in charge was called the returning officer as if he had been away for a while he was in fact the town clerk observers from each of the parties monitored the proceedings to make sure there was no carelessness or dishonesty the process was long and daisy felt tortured by suspense at half past ten they heard the first result from elsewhere harold macmillan a protégé of churchills and a wartime cabinet minister had lost stocktonontees to labour fifteen minutes later there was news of a huge swing to labour in birmingham no radios were allowed into the hall so daisy and lloyd were relying on rumours filtering in from outside and daisy was not sure what to believe it was midday when the returning officer called the candidates and their agents into a corner of the room to give them the result before making the announcement publicly daisy wanted to go with lloyd but she was not permitted the man spoke quietly to all of them as well as lloyd and the sitting mp there was a conservative and a communist daisy studied their faces but could not guess who had won they all went up on to the platform and the room fell silent daisy felt nauseous i michael charles davies being the duly appointed returning officer for the parliamentary constituency of hoxton daisy stood with the labour party observers and stared at lloyd was she about to lose him the thought squeezed her heart and made her breathless with fear in her life she had twice chosen a man who was disastrously wrong charlie farquharson had been the opposite of her father nice but weak boy fitzherbert had been much like her father wilful and selfish now at last she had found lloyd who was both strong and kind she had not picked him for his social status or for what he could do for her but simply because he was an extraordinarily good man he was gentle he was smart he was trustworthy and he adored her it had taken her a long time to realize that he was what she was looking for how foolish she had been the returning officer read out the number of votes cast for each candidate they were listed alphabetically so williams came last daisy was so anxious that she could not keep the numbers in her head reginald sidney blenkinsop five thousand four hundred and twentyseven when lloyds vote was read out the labour party people all around daisy burst out cheering it took her a moment to realize that meant he had won then she saw his solemn expression turn into a broad grin daisy began to clap and cheer louder than anyone he had won and she did not have to leave him she felt as if her life had been saved i therefore declare that lloyd williams is duly elected member of parliament for hoxton lloyd was a member of parliament daisy watched proudly as he stepped forward and made an acceptance speech there was a formula for such speeches she realized and he tediously thanked the returning officer and his staff then thanked his losing opponents for a fair fight she was impatient to hug him he finished with a few sentences about the task that lay ahead of rebuilding wartorn britain and creating a fairer society he stood down to more applause coming off the stage he walked straight to daisy put his arms around her and kissed her she said well done my darling then she found she could no longer speak after a while they went outside and caught a bus to labour party headquarters at transport house there they learned that labour had already won seats it was a landslide every pundit had been wrong and everyones expectations were confounded when all the results were in labour had seats the conservatives the liberals had twelve and the communists one stepney labour had an overwhelming majority at seven oclock in the evening winston churchill britains great war leader went to buckingham palace and resigned as prime minister daisy thought of one of churchills jibes about attlee an empty car drew up and clem got out the man he called a nonentity had thrashed him at half past seven clement attlee went to the palace in his own car driven by his wife violet and king george vi asked him to become prime minister in the house in nutley street after they had all listened to the news on the radio lloyd turned to daisy and said well thats that can we get married now yes said daisy as quick as you like vi volodya and zoyas wedding reception was held in one of the smaller banqueting halls in the kremlin the war with germany was over but the soviet union was still battered and impoverished and a lavish celebration would have been frowned upon zoya had a new dress but volodya wore his uniform however there was plenty to eat and the vodka flowed freely volodyas nephew and niece were there the twin children of his sister anya and her unpleasant husband ilya dvorkin they were not yet six years old dimka the darkhaired boy sat quietly reading a book while blueeyed tania was running around the room crashing into tables and annoying the guests in a reversal of the expected behaviour of boys and girls zoya looked so desirable in pink that volodya would have liked to leave right away and take her to bed that was out of the question of course his fathers circle of friends included some of the most senior generals and politicians in the country and many of them had come to toast the happy couple grigori was hinting that one extremely distinguished guest might arrive later volodya hoped it was not the depraved nkvd boss beria volodyas happiness did not quite let him forget the horrors he had seen and the profound misgivings he had developed about soviet communism the unspeakable brutality of the secret police the blunders of stalin that had cost millions of lives and the propaganda that had encouraged the red army to behave like crazed beasts in germany had all caused him to doubt the most fundamental things he had been brought up to believe he wondered uneasily what kind of country dimka and tania would grow up in but today was not the day to think about that the soviet elite were in a good mood they had won the war and defeated germany their old enemy japan was being crushed by the usa the insane honour code of japans leaders made it difficult for them to surrender but it was only a matter of time now tragically while they clung to their pride more japanese and american troops would die and more japanese women and children would be bombed out of their homes but the end result would be the same sadly it seemed there was nothing the americans could do to hasten the process and prevent unnecessary deaths volodyas father drunk and happy made a speech the red army has occupied poland he said never again will that country be used as a springboard for a german invasion of russia all the old comrades cheered and thumped the tables in western europe communist parties are being endorsed by the masses as never before in the paris municipal elections last march the communist party won the largest share of the vote i congratulate our french comrades they cheered again as i look around the world today i see that the russian revolution in which so many brave men fought and died he tailed off as drunken tears came to his eyes a hush descended on the room he recovered himself i see that the revolution has never been as secure as it is today they raised their glasses the revolution the revolution everyone drank the doors flew open and comrade stalin walked in everyone stood up his hair was grey and he looked tired he was about sixtyfive and he had been ill there were rumours that he had suffered a series of strokes or minor heart attacks but his mood today was ebullient i have come to kiss the bride he said he walked up to zoya and put his hands on her shoulders she was a good three inches taller than he but she managed to stoop discreetly he kissed her on both cheeks allowing his greymoustached mouth to linger just long enough to make volodya feel resentful then he stepped back and said how about a drink for me several people hastened to get him a glass of vodka grigori insisted on giving stalin his chair in the centre of the head table the buzz of conversation resumed but it was subdued they were thrilled he was here but now they had to be careful of every word and every move this man could have a person killed with a snap of his fingers and he frequently had more vodka was brought the band began to play russian folk dances and slowly people relaxed volodya zoya grigori and katerina did a fourperson dance called a kadril which was intended to be comic and always made people laugh after that more couples danced and the men started to do the barynya in which they had to squat and kick up their legs which caused many of them to fall over volodya kept checking on stalin out of the corner of his eye as did everyone else in the room and he seemed to be enjoying himself tapping his glass on the table in time with the balalaikas zoya and katerina were dancing a troika with zoyas boss vasili a senior physicist working on the bomb project and volodya was sitting out when the atmosphere changed an aide in a civilian suit came in hurried around the edge of the room and went right up to stalin without ceremony he leaned over the leaders shoulder and spoke to him quietly but urgently stalin at first looked puzzled and asked a sharp question then another then his face changed he went pale and seemed to stare at the dancers without seeing them volodya said under his breath what the hell has happened the dancers had not yet noticed but those sitting at the head table looked frightened after a moment stalin stood up those around him deferentially did the same volodya saw that his father was still dancing people had been shot for less but stalin had no eyes for the wedding guests with the aide at his side he left the table he walked towards the door crossing the dance floor terrified revellers jumped out of his way one couple fell over stalin did not seem to notice the band ground to a halt saying nothing looking at nobody stalin left the room some of the generals followed him out looking scared another aide appeared then two more they all sought out their bosses and spoke to them a young man in a tweed jacket went up to vasili zoya seemed to know the man and listened intently to him she looked shocked vasili and the aide left the room volodya went to zoya and said for gods sake whats going on her voice was shaky the americans have dropped a nuclear bomb in japan her beautifully pale face seemed even whiter than normal at first the japanese government couldnt figure out what had happened it took them hours to realize what it was are we sure it flattened five square miles of buildings they estimate that seventyfive thousand people were killed instantly how many bombs one one bomb yes good god no wonder stalin turned pale they both stood silent the news was spreading around the room visibly some people sat stunned others got up and left heading for their offices their telephones their desks and their staff this changes everything volodya said including our honeymoon plans said zoya my leave is sure to be cancelled we thought the soviet union was safe your father has just made a speech about how the revolution has never been so secure now nothing is secure no said zoya not until we have a bomb of our own vii jacky jakes and georgy were in buffalo staying at margas apartment for the first time greg and lev were there too and on victory japan day wednesday august they all went to humboldt park the paths were crowded with jubilant couples and there were hundreds of children splashing in the pond greg was happy and proud the bomb had worked the two devices dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki had wreaked sickening devastation but they had brought the war to a quick end and saved thousands of american lives greg had played a role in that because of what they had all done georgy was going to grow up in a free world hes nine greg said to jacky they were sitting on a bench talking while lev and marga took georgy to buy ice cream i can hardly believe it what will he be i wonder jacky said fiercely hes not going to do something stupid like acting or playing the goddamn trumpet hes got brains would you like him to be a college professor like your father yes in that case greg had been leading up to this and was nervous about how jacky might react he ought to go to a good school what did you have in mind how about boarding school he could go where i went hed be the only black pupil not necessarily when i was there we had a coloured guy an indian from delhi called kamal just one yes was he teased sure we called him camel but the boys got used to him and he made some friends what happened to him do you know he became a pharmacist i hear he already owns two drugstores in new york jacky nodded greg could tell that she was not opposed to this plan she came from a cultured family although she herself had rebelled and dropped out she believed in the value of education what about the school fees i could ask my father would he pay look at them greg pointed along the path lev marga and georgy were returning from the icecream vendors cart lev and georgy were walking side by side eating icecream cones holding hands my conservative father holding the hand of a coloured child in a public park trust me hell pay the school fees georgy doesnt really fit anywhere jacky said looking troubled hes a black boy with a white daddy i know people in your mothers apartment building think im the maid did you know that yes ive been careful not to set them straight if they thought negroes were in the building as guests there might be trouble greg sighed im sorry but youre right life is going to be tough for georgy i know said greg but hes got us jacky gave him a rare smile yeah she said thats something part three the cold peace iii after the wedding volodya and zoya moved into an apartment of their own few russian newlyweds were so lucky for four years the industrial might of the soviet union had been directed to making weapons hardly any homes had been built and many had been destroyed but volodya was a major in red army intelligence as well as the son of a general and he was able to pull strings it was a compact space a living room with a dining table a bedroom so small the bed almost filled it a kitchen that was crowded with two people in it a cramped toilet with a washbasin and shower and a tiny hall with a closet for their clothes when the radio was on in the living room they could hear it all over the flat they quickly made it their own zoya bought a bright yellow coverlet for the bed volodyas mother produced a set of crockery that she had bought in in anticipation of his wedding and saved all through the war volodya hung a picture on the wall a graduation photograph of his class at the military intelligence academy they made love more now being alone made a difference volodya had not anticipated he had never felt particularly inhibited when sleeping with zoya at his parents place or in the apartment she had used to share but now he realized it had an influence you had to keep your voice down you listened in case the bed squeaked and there was always the possibility albeit remote that somebody would walk in on you other peoples homes were never completely private they often woke early made love then lay kissing and talking for an hour before getting dressed for work lying with his head on her thighs on one such morning the smell of sex in his nostrils volodya said do you want some tea yes please she stretched luxuriously reclining on the pillows volodya put on a robe and crossed the tiny hallway to the little kitchen where he lit the gas under the samovar he was displeased to see the pots and dishes from last nights dinner stacked in the sink zoya he said this kitchens in a mess she could hear him easily in the small apartment i know she said he went back to the bedroom why didnt you clean up last night why didnt you it had not occurred to him that it might be his responsibility but he said i had a report to write and i was tired the suggestion that it was his fault irritated him i hate a filthy kitchen so do i why was she being so obtuse if you dont like it clean it lets do it together right away she sprang out of bed she pushed past him with a sexy smile and went into the kitchen volodya followed she said you wash ill dry she took a clean towel from a drawer she was still naked he could not help but smile her body was long and slim and her skin was white she had flat breasts and pointed nipples and the hair of her groin was fine and blonde one of the joys of being married to her was her habit of moving around the apartment in the nude he could stare at her body for as long as he liked she seemed to enjoy it if she caught his eye she showed no embarrassment but just smiled he rolled up the sleeves of his robe and began to wash the dishes passing them to zoya to dry washing up was not a very manly activity volodya had never seen his father do it but zoya seemed to think such chores should be shared it was an eccentric idea did zoya have a highly developed sense of fairness in marriage or was he being emasculated he thought he heard something outside he glanced into the hall the apartment door was only three or four steps from the kitchen sink he could see nothing out of the ordinary then the door was smashed open zoya screamed volodya picked up the carving knife he had just washed he stepped past zoya and stood in the kitchen doorway a uniformed policeman holding a sledgehammer was just outside the ruined door volodya was filled with fear and rage he said what the fuck is this the policeman stepped back and a small thin man with a face like a rodent entered the flat it was volodyas brotherinlaw ilya dvorkin an agent of the secret police he was wearing leather gloves ilya said volodya you stupid weasel speak respectfully said ilya volodya was baffled as well as angry the secret police did not normally arrest the staff of red army intelligence and vice versa otherwise it would have been gang warfare why the hell have you bust my door i would have opened it two more agents stepped into the hall and stood behind ilya they wore their trademark leather coats despite the mild latesummer weather volodya was fearful as well as angry what was going on ilya said in a shaky voice put the knife down volodya no need to be afraid said volodya i was just washing up he handed the knife to zoya standing behind him please step into the living room we can talk while zoya gets dressed do you imagine this is a social call ilya said indignantly whatever kind of call it is im sure you dont want the embarrassment of seeing my wife naked i am here on official police business then why did they send my brotherinlaw ilya lowered his voice dont you understand that it would be much worse for you if someone else had come this looked like bad trouble volodya struggled to keep up the facade of bravado exactly what do you and these other assholes want comrade beria has taken over the direction of the nuclear physics programme volodya knew that stalin had set up a new committee to direct the work and made beria chairman beria knew nothing about physics and was completely unqualified to organize a scientific research project but stalin trusted him it was the usual problem of soviet government incompetent but loyal people were promoted into jobs they could not cope with volodya said and comrade beria needs my wife in her laboratory developing the bomb have you come to drive her to work the americans created their nuclear bomb before the soviets indeed could they perhaps have given research physics higher priority than we did it is not possible that capitalist science should be superior to communist science this is a truism volodya was puzzled where was this heading so what do you conclude there must have been sabotage that was exactly the kind of ludicrous fantasy the secret police would dream up what kind of sabotage some of the scientists deliberately delayed the development of the soviet bomb volodya began to understand and he felt afraid but he continued to respond belligerently it was always a mistake to show weakness with these people why the hell would they do that because they are traitors and your wife is one youd better not be serious you piece of shit i am here to arrest your wife what volodya was flabbergasted this is insane it is the view of my organization there is no evidence for evidence go to hiroshima zoya spoke for the first time since she had screamed ill have to go with them volodya dont get yourself arrested too volodya pointed a finger at ilya you are in so much fucking trouble im carrying out my orders step out of the way my wife is going into the bedroom to get dressed no time for that said ilya she must come as she is dont be ridiculous ilya put his nose in the air a respectable soviet citizen would not walk around the apartment with no clothes on volodya wondered briefly how his sister felt being married to this creep you the secret police morally disapprove of nudity her nakedness is evidence of her degradation we will take her as she is no you fucking wont stand aside you stand aside shes going to get dressed volodya stepped into the hall and stood in front of the three agents holding his arms out so that zoya could pass behind him as she moved ilya reached past volodya and grabbed her arm volodya punched him in the face twice ilya cried out and staggered back the two men in leather coats stepped forward volodya aimed a punch at one but the man dodged it then each man took one of volodyas arms he struggled but they were strong and seemed to have done this before they slammed him against the wall while they held him ilya punched him in the face with leathergloved fists twice three times four then in the stomach again and again until volodya puked blood zoya tried to intervene but ilya punched her too and she screamed and fell back volodyas bathrobe came open in front ilya kicked him in the balls then kicked his knees volodya sagged unable to stand but the two men in leather coats held him up and ilya punched him some more at last ilya turned away rubbing his knuckles the other two released volodya and he crumpled to the floor he could hardly breathe and felt unable to move but he was conscious out of the corner of his eye he saw the two heavies grab zoya and march her naked out of the apartment ilya followed as the minutes went by the pain changed from sharp agony to deep dull ache and volodyas breathing began to return to normal motion eventually returned to his limbs and he dragged himself upright he made it to the phone and dialled his fathers number hoping the old man had not yet left for work he was relieved to hear his fathers voice theyve arrested zoya he said fucking bastards grigori said who was it it was ilya what make some calls volodya said see if you can find out what the fuck is going on i have to wash off the blood what blood volodya hung up it was only a couple of steps to the bathroom he dropped his bloodstained robe and got into the shower the warm water brought some relief to his bruised body ilya was mean but not strong and he had not broken any bones volodya turned off the water he looked in the bathroom mirror his face was covered with cuts and bruises he did not bother to dry himself with considerable effort he got dressed in his red army uniform he wanted the symbol of authority his father arrived as he was trying to tie the laces of his boots what the fucking hell happened here grigori roared volodya said they were looking for a fight and i was foolish enough to give them one his father was unsympathetic at first id have expected you to know better they insisted on taking her away naked fucking creeps did you find out anything not yet i talked to a couple of people no one knows anything grigori looked worried either someone has made a really stupid mistake or for some reason theyre very sure of themselves drive me to my office lemitov is going to be mad as hell he wont let them get away with this if they are allowed to do it to me theyll do it to all of red army intelligence grigoris car and driver were waiting outside they drove to the khodynka airfield grigori stayed in the car while volodya limped into red army intelligence headquarters he went straight to the office of his boss colonel lemitov he tapped on the door walked in and said the fucking secret police have arrested my wife i know said lemitov you know i okayed it volodyas jaw dropped what the fuck sit down what is going on sit down and shut up and ill tell you volodya eased himself painfully into a chair lemitov said we have to have a nuclear bomb and fast at the moment stalin is playing it tough with the americans because were fairly sure they dont have a big enough arsenal of nuclear weapons to wipe us out but theyre building a stockpile and at some point they will use them unless we are in a position to retaliate this made no sense my wife cant design the bomb while the secret police are punching her in the face this is insane shut the fuck up our problem is that there are several possible designs the americans took five years to figure out which would work we dont have that much time we have to steal their research well still need russian physicists to copy the design and for that they have to be in their laboratories not locked in the basement of the lubyanka you know a man called wilhelm frunze i was at school with him the berlin boys academy he gave us valuable information about british nuclear research then he moved to the states where he worked on the nuclear bomb project the washington staff of the nkvd contacted him scared him by their incompetence and fucked up the relationship we need to win him back what has all this got to do with me he trusts you i dont know that i havent seen him for twelve years we want you to go to america and talk to him but why did you arrest zoya to make sure you come back ii volodya told himself he knew how to do this in berlin before the war he had shaken off gestapo tails met with potential spies recruited them and made them into reliable sources of secret intelligence it was never easy especially the part where he had to talk someone into turning traitor but he was expert however this was america the western countries he had visited germany and spain in the thirties and forties were nothing like this he was overwhelmed all his life he had been told that hollywood movies gave an exaggerated impression of prosperity and that in reality most americans lived in poverty but it was clear to volodya from the day he arrived in the usa that the movies hardly exaggerated at all and poor people were hard to find new york was jammed with cars many driven by people who clearly were not important government officials youngsters men in work clothes even women out shopping and everybody was so well dressed all the men appeared to be wearing their best suits the womens calves were clad in sheer stockings everyone seemed to have new shoes he had to keep reminding himself of the bad side of america there was poverty somewhere negroes were persecuted and in the south they could not vote there was a lot of crime americans themselves said that it was rampant although strangely volodya did not actually see any evidence of it and he felt quite safe walking the streets he spent a few days exploring new york he worked on his english which was not good but it hardly mattered the city was full of people who spoke broken english with heavy accents he got to know the faces of some of the fbi agents assigned to tail him and identified several convenient locations where he would be able to lose them one sunny morning he left the soviet consulate in new york hatless and wearing only grey slacks and a blue shirt as if he were going to run a few errands a young man in a dark suit and tie followed him he went to the saks fifth avenue department store and bought underwear and a shirt with a small brown checked pattern whoever was tailing him had to think he was probably just shopping the nkvd chief at the consulate had announced that a soviet team would shadow volodya throughout his american visit to make sure of his good behaviour he could barely contain his rage at the organization that had imprisoned zoya and he had to repress the urge to take the man by the throat and strangle him but he had remained calm he had pointed out sarcastically that in order to fulfil his mission he would have to evade fbi surveillance and in doing so he might inadvertently also lose his nkvd tail but he wished them luck most days he shook them off in five minutes so the young man tailing him was almost certainly an fbi agent his crisply conservative clothes corroborated that carrying his purchases in a paper bag volodya left the store by a side entrance and hailed a cab he left the fbi man at the kerb waving his arm when the cab had turned two corners volodya threw the driver a bill and jumped out he darted into a subway station left again by a different entrance and waited in the doorway of an office building for five minutes the young man in the dark suit was nowhere to be seen volodya walked to penn station there he doublechecked that he was not being followed then bought his ticket with nothing but that and his paper bag he boarded a train the journey to albuquerque took three days the train sped through mile after endless mile of rich farmland mighty factories belching smoke and great cities with skyscrapers pointing arrogantly at the heavens the soviet union was bigger but apart from the ukraine it was mostly pine forests and frozen steppes he had never imagined wealth on this scale and wealth was not all for several days something had been nagging at the back of volodyas mind something strange about life in america eventually he realized what it was no one asked for his papers after he had passed through immigration control in new york he had not shown his passport again in this country it seemed anyone could walk into a railway station or a bus terminus and buy a ticket to any place without having to get permission or explain the purpose of the trip to an official it gave him a dangerously exhilarating sense of freedom he could go anywhere americas wealth also heightened volodyas sense of the danger his country faced the germans had almost destroyed the soviet union and this country was three times as populous and ten times as rich the thought that russians might become underlings frightened into subservience softened volodyas doubts about communism despite what the nkvd had done to him and his wife if he had children he did not want them to grow up in a world tyrannized by america he travelled via pittsburgh and chicago and attracted no attention en route his clothes were american and his accent was not noticed for the simple reason that he spoke to no one he bought sandwiches and coffee by pointing and paying he flicked through newspapers and magazines that other travellers left behind looking at the pictures and trying to work out the meanings of the headlines the last part of the journey took him through a desert landscape of desolate beauty with distant snowy peaks stained red by the sunset which probably explained why they were called the blood of christ mountains he went to the toilet where he changed his underwear and put on the new shirt he had bought in saks he expected the fbi or army security to be watching the train station in albuquerque and sure enough he spotted a young man whose check jacket too warm for the climate of new mexico in september did not quite conceal the bulge of a gun in a shoulder holster however the agent was undoubtedly interested in longdistance travellers who might be arriving from new york or washington volodya with no hat or jacket and no luggage looked like a local man coming back from a short trip he was not followed as he walked to the bus station and boarded a greyhound for santa fe he reached his destination late in the afternoon he noted two fbi men at the santa fe bus station and they scrutinized him however they could not tail everyone who got off the bus and once again his casual appearance caused them to dismiss him doing his best to look as if he knew where he was going he strolled along the streets the low flatroofed pueblostyle houses and squat churches baking in the sun reminded him of spain the storefront buildings overhung the sidewalks creating pleasantly shady arcades he avoided la fonda the big hotel on the town square next to the cathedral and checked in to the st francis he paid cash and gave his name as robert pender which might have been american or one of several european nationalities my suitcase will be delivered later he said to the pretty girl behind the reception desk if im out when it comes can you make sure it gets sent up to my room oh sure that wont be a problem she said thank you he said then he added a phrase he had heard several times on the train i sure appreciate it if im not here someone else will deal with the bag so long as it has your name on it it does he had no luggage but she would never realize that she looked at his entry in the book so mr pender youre from new york there was a touch of scepticism in her voice no doubt because he did not sound like a new yorker im from switzerland originally he explained naming a neutral country that accounts for the accent i havent met a switzerland person before whats it like there volodya had never been to switzerland but he had seen photographs it snows a lot he said well enjoy our new mexico weather i will five minutes later he went out again some of the scientists lived at the los alamos laboratory he had learned from his colleagues in the soviet embassy but it was a shanty town with few civilized comforts and they preferred to rent houses and apartments nearby if they could willi frunze could afford it easily he was married to a successful artist who drew a syndicated strip cartoon called slack alice his wife also called alice could work anywhere so they had a place in the historic downtown neighbourhood the new york office of the nkvd had provided this information they had researched frunze carefully and volodya had his address and phone number and a description of his car a prewar plymouth convertible with whitewall tyres the frunzes building had an art gallery on the ground floor the apartment upstairs had a large northfacing window that would appeal to an artist a plymouth convertible was parked outside volodya preferred not to go in the place might be bugged the frunzes were an affluent childless couple and he guessed they would not stay at home listening to the radio on a friday night he decided to wait around and see if they came out he spent some time in the art gallery looking at the paintings for sale he liked clear vivid pictures and would not have wanted to own any of these messy daubs he found a coffee shop down the block and got a window seat from which he could just see the frunzes door he left there after an hour bought a newspaper and stood at a bus stop pretending to read it the long wait permitted him to establish that no one was watching the frunze apartment that meant that the fbi and army security had not tagged frunze as a high risk he was a foreigner but so were many of the scientists and presumably nothing else was known against him this was a downtown commercial district not a residential neighbourhood and there were plenty of people on the streets but all the same after a couple of hours volodya began to worry that someone might notice him hanging around then the frunzes came out frunze was heavier than he had been twelve years ago there was no shortage of food in america his hair was beginning to recede although he was only thirty he still had that solemn look he wore a sports shirt and khaki pants a common american combination his wife was not so conservatively dressed her fair hair was pinned up under a beret and she wore a shapeless cotton dress in an indistinct brown colour but she had an assortment of bangles on both wrists and numerous rings artists had dressed like that in germany before hitler volodya remembered the couple set off along the street and volodya followed he wondered what the wifes politics were and what difference her presence would make in the difficult conversation he was about to have frunze had been a staunch social democrat back in germany so it was not likely that his wife would be a conservative a speculation that was borne out by her appearance on the other hand she probably did not know he had given secrets to the soviets in london she was an unknown quantity he would prefer to deal with frunze alone and he considered leaving them and trying again tomorrow but the hotel receptionist had noticed his foreign accent so by the morning he might have an fbi tail he could deal with that he thought though not as easily in this small town as in new york or berlin and tomorrow was saturday so the frunzes would probably spend the day together how long might volodya have to wait before catching frunze alone there was never an easy way to do this on balance he decided to go ahead tonight the frunzes went into a diner volodya walked past the place and glanced through the window it was an inexpensive restaurant with booths he thought of going in and sitting down with them but he decided to let them eat first they would be in a good mood when full of food he waited half an hour watching the door from a distance then full of trepidation he went in they were finishing their dinner as he crossed the restaurant frunze glanced up then looked away not recognizing him he slid into the booth next to alice and spoke quietly in german hello willi dont you remember me from school frunze looked hard at him for several seconds then his face broke into a smile peshkov volodya peshkov is it really you a wave of relief washed over volodya frunze was still friendly there was no barrier of hostility to overcome its really me volodya said he offered his hand and they shook turning to alice he said in english i am very bad speaking your language sorry dont bother to try she replied in fluent german my family were immigrants from bavaria frunze said in amazement ive been thinking about you lately because i know another guy with the same surname greg peshkov really my father had a brother called lev who came to america in about no lieutenant peshkov is much younger anyway what are you doing here volodya smiled i came to see you before frunze could ask why he said last time i saw you you were secretary of the neukölln social democratic party this was his second step having established a friendly footing he was reminding frunze of his youthful idealism that experience convinced me that democratic socialism doesnt work frunze said against the nazis we were completely impotent it took the soviet union to stop them that was true and volodya was pleased frunze realized it but more importantly the comment showed that frunzes political ideas had not been softened by life in affluent america alice said we were planning to have a couple of drinks at a bar around the corner a lot of the scientists go there on a friday night would you like to join us the last thing volodya wanted was to be seen in public with the frunzes i dont know he said in fact he had been too long with them in this restaurant it was time for step three reminding frunze of his terrible guilt he leaned forward and lowered his voice willi did you know the americans were going to drop nuclear bombs on japan there was a long pause volodya held his breath he was gambling that frunze would be wracked by remorse for a moment he feared he had gone too far frunze looked as if he might burst into tears then the scientist took a deep breath and got control of himself no i didnt know he said none of us did alice interjected angrily we assumed the american military would give some demonstration of the power of the bomb as a threat to make the japanese surrender earlier so she had known about the bomb beforehand volodya noted he was not surprised men found it hard to keep such things from their wives so we expected a detonation some time somewhere she went on but we imagined they would destroy an uninhabited island or maybe a military facility with a lot of weapons and very few people that might have been justifiable frunze said but his voice fell to a whisper nobody thought they would drop it on a city and kill eighty thousand men women and children volodya nodded i thought you might feel this way he had been hoping for it with all his heart frunze said who wouldnt let me ask you an even more important question this was step four will they do it again i dont know frunze said they might christ forgive us all they might volodya concealed his satisfaction he had made frunze feel responsible for future use of nuclear weapons as well as past volodya nodded thats what we think alice said sharply whos we she was shrewd and probably more worldlywise than her husband she would be hard to fool and volodya decided not to try he had to risk levelling with her a fair question he said and i didnt come all this way to deceive an old friend im a major in red army intelligence they stared at him the possibility must have crossed their minds already but they were surprised by the stark admission i have something i need to say to you volodya went on something hugely important is there somewhere we can go to talk privately they both looked uncertain frunze said our apartment it has probably been bugged by the fbi frunze had some experience of clandestine work but alice was shocked you think so she said incredulously yes could we drive out of town frunze said theres a place we go sometimes around this time of the evening to watch the sunset perfect go to your car get in and wait for me ill be a minute behind you frunze paid the check and left with alice and volodya followed during the short walk he established that no one was tailing him he reached the plymouth and got in they sat three across the front seat american style frunze drove out of town they followed a dirt road to the top of a low hill frunze stopped the car volodya motioned for them all to get out and led them a hundred yards away just in case the car was bugged too they looked across the landscape of stony soil and low bushes towards the setting sun and volodya took step five we think the next nuclear bomb will be dropped somewhere in the soviet union frunze nodded god forbid but youre probably right and theres absolutely nothing we can do about it volodya went on pressing home his point relentlessly there are no precautions we can take no barriers we can erect no way we can protect our people there is no defence against the nuclear bomb the bomb that you made willi i know it said frunze miserably clearly he felt it would be his fault if the ussr was attacked with nuclear weapons step six the only protection would be our own nuclear bomb frunze did not want to believe that its not a defence he said but its a deterrent it might be he conceded alice said we dont want these bombs to spread nor do i said volodya but the only sure way to stop the americans flattening moscow the way they flattened hiroshima is for the soviet union to have a nuclear bomb of its own and threaten retaliation alice said hes right willi hell we all know it she was the tough one volodya saw volodya made his voice light for step seven how many bombs do the americans have right now this was a crucial moment if frunze answered this question he would have crossed a line so far the conversation had been general now volodya was requesting secret information frunze hesitated for a long moment finally he glanced at alice volodya saw her give an almost imperceptible nod frunze said only one volodya concealed his triumph frunze had betrayed trust it was the difficult first move a second secret would come more easily frunze added but theyll have more soon its a race and if we lose we die volodya said urgently we have to build at least one bomb of our own before they have enough to wipe us out can you do that that gave volodya the cue for step eight we need help he saw frunzes face harden and guessed he was remembering whatever it was that had made him refuse to cooperate with the nkvd alice said to volodya what if we say we cant help you that its too dangerous volodya followed his instinct he held up his hands in a gesture of surrender i go home and report failure he said i cant make you do anything you dont want to do i wouldnt want to pressure you or coerce you in any way alice said no threats that confirmed volodyas guess that the nkvd had tried to bully frunze they tried to bully everyone it was all they knew im not even trying to persuade you volodya said to frunze im laying out the facts the rest is up to you if you want to help im here as your contact if you see things differently thats the end of it youre both smart people i couldnt fool you even if i wanted to again they looked at each other he hoped they were thinking how different he was from the last soviet agent who had approached them the moment stretched out agonizingly it was alice who spoke at last what kind of help do you need that was not a yes but it was better than rejection and it led logically to step nine my wife is one of the physicists on the team he said hoping this would humanize him at a moment when they might be in danger of seeing him as manipulative she tells me there are several routes to a nuclear bomb and we dont have time to try them all we can save years if we know what worked for you that makes sense willi said step ten the big one we have to know what type of bomb was dropped on japan frunzes expression was agonized he looked at his wife this time she did not give him the nod but neither did she shake her head she seemed as torn as he did frunze sighed two kinds he said volodya was thrilled and startled two different designs frunze nodded for hiroshima they used a uranium device with a gun ignition we called it little boy for nagasaki fat man a plutonium bomb with an implosion trigger volodya could hardly breathe this was redhot data which is better they both worked obviously but fat man is easier to make why it takes years to produce enough u for a bomb plutonium is quicker once you have a nuclear pile so the ussr should copy fat man definitely there is one more thing you could do to help save russia from destruction volodya said what volodya looked him in the eye get me the design drawings he said willi paled im an american citizen he said youre asking me to commit treason the penalty is death i could go to the electric chair so could your wife volodya thought shes complicit thank god you havent thought of that he said ive asked a lot of people to put their lives at risk in the last few years people like yourselves germans who hated the nazis men and women who took terrible risks to send us information that helped us win the war and i have to say to you what i said to them a lot more people will be killed if you dont do it he fell silent that was his best shot he had nothing more to offer frunze looked at his wife alice said you made the bomb willi frunze said to volodya ill think about it iii two days later he handed over the plans volodya took them to moscow zoya was released from jail she was not as angry about her imprisonment as he was they did it to protect the revolution she said and i wasnt hurt it was like staying in a really bad hotel on her first day at home after they made love he said i have something to show you something i brought back from america he rolled off the bed opened a drawer and took out a book its called the searsroebuck catalogue he said he sat beside her on the bed and opened the book look at this the catalogue fell open at a page of womens dresses the models were impossibly slender but the fabrics were bright and cheerful stripes and checks and solid colours some with ruffles pleats and belts thats attractive zoya said putting her finger on one is two dollars ninetyeight a lot of money not really volodya said the average wage is about fifty dollars a week rent is about a third of that really zoya was amazed so most people could easily afford these dresses thats right maybe not peasants on the other hand these catalogues were invented for farmers who live a hundred miles from the nearest store how does it work you pick what you want from the book and send them the money then a couple of weeks later the mailman brings you whatever you ordered it must be like being a tsar zoya took the book from him and turned the page oh here are some more the next page showed jacketandskirt combinations for four dollars ninetyeight these are elegant too she said keep turning the pages volodya said zoya was astonished to see page after page of womens coats hats shoes underwear pyjamas and stockings people can have any of these she said thats right but theres more choice on one of these pages than there is in the average russian shop yes she carried on slowly leafing through the book there was a similar range of clothing for men and again for children zoya put her finger on a heavy woollen winter coat for boys that cost fifteen dollars at that price i suppose every boy in america has one they probably do after the clothes came furniture you could buy a bed for twentyfive dollars everything was cheap if you had fifty dollars a week and it went on and on there were hundreds of things that could not be bought for any money in the soviet union toys and games beauty products guitars elegant chairs power tools novels in colourful jackets christmas decorations and electric toasters there was even a tractor do you think zoya said that any farmer in america who wants a tractor can have one right away only if he has the money said volodya he doesnt have to put his name down on a list and wait for a few years no zoya closed the book and looked at him solemnly if people can have all this she said why would they want to be communist good question said volodya the children of berlin had a new game called komm frau come woman it was one of a dozen games in which boys chase girls but it had a new twist carla noticed the boys would team up and target one of the girls when they caught her they would shout komm frau and throw her to the ground then they would hold her down while one of their number lay on top of her and simulated sexual intercourse children of seven and eight who ought not to know what rape was played this game because they had seen what red army soldiers did to german women every russian knew that one phrase of the german language komm frau what was it about the russians carla had never met anyone who had been raped by a french british american or canadian soldier though she supposed it must happen by contrast every woman she knew between fifteen and fiftyfive had been raped by at least one soviet soldier her mother maud her friend frieda friedas mother monika ada the maid all of them yet they were lucky for they were still alive some women abused by dozens of men hour after hour had died carla had heard of a girl who had been bitten to death only rebecca rosen had escaped after carla had protected her the day the jewish hospital was liberated rebecca moved into the von ulrich town house it was in the soviet zone but she had nowhere else to go she hid for months like a criminal in the attic coming down only late at night when the bestial russians had fallen into drunken sleep carla spent a couple of hours up there with her when she could and they played card games and told each other their life stories carla wanted to be like an older sister but rebecca treated her like a mother then carla found she was going to be a mother for real maud and monika were in their fifties and too old to have babies mercifully and ada was lucky but both carla and frieda were pregnant by their rapists frieda had an abortion it was illegal and a nazi law that threatened the death penalty was still in force so frieda went to an elderly midwife who did it for five cigarettes frieda contracted a severe infection and would have died but that carla was able to steal scarce penicillin from the hospital carla decided to have her baby her feelings about it swung violently from one extreme to another when suffering morning sickness she raged against the beasts who had violated her body and left her with this burden at other times she found herself sitting with her hands on her belly staring into space and thinking dreamily about baby clothes then she would wonder if the babys face would remind her of one of the men and cause her to hate her own child but surely it would have some von ulrich features too she felt anxious and frightened she was eight months pregnant in january like most germans she was also cold hungry and destitute when her pregnancy became obvious she had to give up nursing and join the millions of unemployed food rations were issued every ten days the daily amount for those without special privileges was calories it still had to be paid for of course and even for customers with cash and ration cards sometimes there was simply no food to buy carla had considered asking the soviets for special treatment because of her wartime work as a spy but heinrich had tried that and suffered a frightening experience red army intelligence had expected him to continue to spy for them and asked him to infiltrate the us military when he said he would rather not they became nasty and threatened to send him to a labour camp he got out of it by saying he spoke no english therefore was no use to them but carla was well warned and decided it was safest to keep quiet today carla and maud were happy because they had sold a chest of drawers it was a jugendstil piece in burled light oak that walters parents had bought when they got married in carla maud and ada had loaded it on to a borrowed handcart there were still no men in their house erik and werner were among millions of german soldiers who had disappeared perhaps they were dead colonel beck had told carla that almost three million germans had died in battle on the eastern front and more had died as prisoners of the soviets killed by hunger cold and disease but another two million were still alive and working in labour camps in the soviet union some had come back they had either escaped from their guards or had been released because they were too ill to work and they had joined the thousands of displaced persons on the tramp all over europe trying to find their way home carla and maud had written letters and sent them care of the red army but no replies had ever come carla felt torn about the prospect of werners return she still loved him and hoped desperately that he was alive and well but she dreaded meeting him when she was pregnant with a rapists baby although it was not her fault she felt irrationally ashamed so the three women pushed the handcart through the streets they left rebecca behind the red army orgy of rape and looting had passed its nightmare peak and rebecca no longer lived in the attic but it was still not safe for a pretty girl to walk the streets huge photographs of lenin and stalin now hung over unter den linden once the promenade of germanys fashionable elite most berlin roads had been cleared and the rubble of destroyed buildings stood in stacks every few hundred yards ready to be reused perhaps if ever germans were able to rebuild their country acres of houses had been flattened often entire city blocks it would take years to deal with the wreckage there were thousands of bodies rotting in the ruins and the sickly sweet smell of decaying human flesh had been in the air all summer now it smelled only after rain meanwhile the city had been divided into four zones russian american british and french many of the buildings still standing had been commandeered by the occupying troops berliners lived where they could often seeking inadequate shelter in the surviving rooms of halfdemolished houses the city had running water again and electric power came on fitfully but it was hard to find fuel for heating and cooking the chest of drawers might be almost as valuable chopped up for firewood they took it to wedding in the french zone where they sold it to a charming parisian colonel for a carton of gitanes the occupation currency had become worthless because the soviets printed too much of it so everything was bought and sold for cigarettes now they were returning triumphant maud and ada steering the empty cart while carla walked alongside she ached all over from pushing the cart but they were rich a whole carton of cigarettes would go a long way night fell and the temperature dropped to freezing their route home took them briefly into the british sector carla sometimes wondered whether the british might help her mother if they knew the hardship she was suffering on the other hand maud had been a german citizen for twentysix years her brother earl fitzherbert was wealthy and influential but he had refused to support her after her marriage to walter von ulrich and he was a stubborn man it was not likely he would change his attitude they came across a small crowd thirty or forty ragged people outside a house that had been taken over by the occupying power stopping to find out what they were staring at the three women saw a party going on inside through the windows they could observe brightly lit rooms laughing men and women holding drinks and waitresses moving through the throng with trays of food carla looked around her the crowd was mostly women and children there were not many men left in berlin or indeed in germany and they were all staring longingly at the windows like rejected sinners outside the gates of paradise it was a pathetic sight this is obscene said maud and she marched up the path to the door of the house a british sentry stood in her way and said nein nein probably the only german he knew maud addressed him in the crisp upperclass english she had spoken as a girl i must see your commanding officer immediately carla admired her mothers nerve and poise as always the sentry looked doubtfully at mauds threadbare coat but after a moment he tapped on the door it opened and a face looked out english lady wants the co said the sentry a moment later the door opened again and two people looked out they might have been caricatures of a british officer and his wife he in his mess kit with a black bow tie she in a long dress and pearls good evening maud said im frightfully sorry to disturb your party they stared at her astonished to be spoken to that way by a woman in rags maud went on i just thought you should see what youre doing to these wretched people outside the couple looked at the crowd maud said you might draw the curtains for pitys sake after a moment the woman said oh dear george have we been terribly unkind unintentionally perhaps the man said gruffly could we possibly make amends by sending some food out to them yes maud said quickly that would be a kindness as well as an apology the officer looked dubious it was probably against some kind of regulation to give canapés to starving germans the woman pleaded george darling may we oh very well said her husband the woman turned back to maud thank you for alerting us we really didnt mean to do this youre welcome maud said and she retreated down the path a few minutes later guests began to emerge from the house with plates of sandwiches and cakes which they offered to the starving crowd carla grinned her mothers impudence had paid off she took a large piece of fruit cake which she wolfed in a few starved bites it contained more sugar than she had eaten in the past six months the curtains were drawn the guests returned to the house and the crowd dispersed maud and ada grasped the handles of the cart and recommenced pushing it home well done mother said carla a carton of gitanes and a free meal all in one afternoon apart from the soviets few of the occupying soldiers were cruel to germans carla reflected she found it surprising american gis gave out chocolate bars even the french whose own children had gone hungry under german occupation often showed kindness after all the misery we germans have inflicted on our neighbours carla thought its astonishing they dont hate us more on the other hand what with the nazis the red army and the air raids perhaps they think weve been punished enough it was late when they got home they left the cart with the neighbours who had loaned it giving them half a pack of gitanes as payment they entered their house which was luckily still intact there was no glass in most of the windows and the stonework was pocked with craters but the place had not suffered structural damage and it still kept the weather out all the same the four women now lived in the kitchen sleeping there on mattresses they dragged in from the hall at night it was hard enough to warm that one room and they certainly did not have fuel to heat the rest of the house the kitchen stove had burned coal in the old days but that was now virtually unobtainable however they had found the stove would burn many other things books newspapers broken furniture even net curtains they slept in pairs carla with rebecca and maud with ada rebecca often cried herself to sleep in carlas arms as she had the night after her parents were killed the long walk had exhausted carla and she immediately lay down ada built up the fire in the stove with old news magazines rebecca had brought down from the attic maud added water to the remains of the lunchtime bean soup and reheated it for their supper sitting up to drink her soup carla suffered a sharp abdominal pain this was not a result of pushing the handcart she realized it was something else she checked the date and counted back to the date of the liberation of the jewish hospital mother she said fearfully i think the babys coming its too soon maud said im thirtysix weeks pregnant and im getting cramps then wed better get ready maud went upstairs to fetch towels ada brought a wooden chair from the dining room she had a useful length of twisted steel from a bomb site that served her as a sledgehammer she smashed the chair into manageable pieces then built up the fire in the stove carla put her hands on her distended belly you might have waited for warmer weather baby she said soon she was in too much pain to notice the cold she had not known anything could hurt this much nor that it could go on so long she was in labour all night maud and ada took turns holding her hand while she moaned and cried rebecca looked on whitefaced and scared the grey light of morning was filtering through the newspaper taped over the glassless kitchen window when at last the babys head emerged carla was overwhelmed by a feeling of relief like nothing she had ever experienced even though the pain did not immediately cease after one more agonizing push maud took the baby from between her legs a boy she said she blew on his face and he opened his mouth and cried she gave the baby to carla and propped her upright on the mattress with some cushions from the drawing room he had lots of dark hair all over his head maud tied off the cord with a piece of cotton then cut it carla unbuttoned her blouse and put the baby to her breast she was worried she might have no milk her breasts should have swollen and leaked towards the end of her pregnancy but they had not perhaps because the baby was early perhaps because the mother was undernourished but after a few moments of sucking she felt a strange pain and the milk began to flow soon he fell asleep ada brought a bowl of warm water and a rag and gently washed the babys face and head then the rest of him rebecca whispered hes so beautiful carla said mother shall we call him walter she had not intended to be dramatic but maud fell apart her face crumpled and she bent double wracked by terrible sobs she recovered herself sufficiently to say im sorry then she was convulsed by grief again oh walter my walter she wept eventually her crying subsided im sorry she said again i didnt mean to make a fuss she wiped her face with her sleeve i just wish your father could see the baby thats all its so unfair ada surprised them both by quoting the book of job the lord giveth and the lord taketh away she said blessed be the name of the lord carla did not believe in god no holy being worthy of the name could have allowed the nazi death camps to happen but all the same she found comfort in the quotation it was about accepting everything in human life including the pain of birth and the sorrow of death maud seemed to appreciate it too and she became calmer carla looked adoringly at baby walter she would care for him and feed him and keep him warm she vowed no matter what difficulties stood in the way he was the most wonderful child that had ever been born and she would love and cherish him for ever he woke up and carla gave him her nipple again he sucked contentedly making small smacking noises with his mouth while four women watched him for a little while in the warm dimlit kitchen there was no other sound ii the first speech made by a new member of parliament is called a maiden speech and is usually dull certain things have to be said stock phrases are used and the convention is that the subject must not be controversial colleagues and opponents alike congratulate the newcomer the traditions are observed and the ice is broken lloyd williams made his first real speech a few months later during the debate on the national insurance bill that was more scary in preparing it he had two orators in mind his grandfather dai williams used the language and rhythms of the bible not just in chapel but also perhaps especially when speaking of the hardship and injustice of the life of a coal miner he relished short words rich in meaning toil sin greed he spoke of the hearth and the pit and the grave churchill did the same but had humour that dai williams lacked his long majestic sentences often ended with an unexpected image or a reversal of meaning having been editor of the government newspaper the british gazette during the general strike of he had warned trade unionists make your minds perfectly clear if ever you let loose upon us again a general strike we will loose upon you another british gazette a speech needed such surprises lloyd believed they were like the raisins in a bun but when he stood up to speak he found that his carefully wrought sentences suddenly seemed unreal his audience clearly felt the same and he could sense that the fifty or sixty mps in the chamber were only half listening he suffered a moment of panic how could he be boring about a subject that mattered so profoundly to the people he represented on the government front bench he could see his mother now minister for schools and his uncle billy minister for coal billy williams had started work down the pit at the age of thirteen lloyd knew ethel had been the same age when she began scrubbing the floors of tŷ gwyn this debate was not about fine phrases it was about their lives after a minute he abandoned his script and spoke extempore he recalled instead the misery of workingclass families made penniless by unemployment or disability scenes he had witnessed first hand in the east end of london and the south wales coalfield his voice betrayed the emotion he felt somewhat to his embarrassment but he ploughed on he sensed his audience beginning to pay attention he spoke of his grandfather and others who had started the labour movement with the dream of comprehensive employment insurance to banish forever the fear of destitution when he sat down there was a roar of approval in the visitors gallery his wife daisy smiled proudly and gave him a thumbsup sign he listened to the rest of the debate in a glow of satisfaction he felt he had passed his first real test as an mp afterwards in the lobby he was approached by a labour whip one of the people responsible for making sure mps voted the right way after congratulating lloyd on his speech the whip said how would you like to be a parliamentary private secretary lloyd was thrilled each minister and secretary of state had at least one pps in truth a pps was often little more than a bagcarrier but the job was the usual first step on the way to a ministerial appointment id be honoured lloyd said who would i be working for ernie bevin lloyd could hardly believe his luck bevin was foreign secretary and the closest colleague of prime minister attlee the intimate relationship between the two men was a case of the attraction of opposites attlee was middle class the son of a lawyer an oxford graduate an officer in the first world war bevin was the illegitimate child of a housemaid never knew his father started work at the age of eleven and founded the mammoth transport and general workers union they were physical opposites too attlee slim and dapper quiet solemn bevin a huge man tall and strong and overweight with a loud laugh the foreign secretary referred to the prime minister as little clem all the same they were staunch allies bevin was a hero to lloyd and to millions of ordinary british people theres nothing id like more lloyd said but hasnt bevin already got a pps he needs two the whip said go to the foreign office tomorrow morning at nine and you can get started thank you lloyd hurried along the oakpanelled corridor heading for his mothers office he had arranged to meet daisy there after the debate mam he said as he entered ive been made pps to ernie bevin then he saw that ethel was not alone earl fitzherbert was with her fitz stared at lloyd with a mixture of surprise and distaste even in his shock lloyd noticed that his father was wearing a perfectly cut lightgrey suit with a doublebreasted waistcoat he looked back at his mother she was quite calm this encounter was not a surprise to her she must have contrived it the earl came to the same conclusion what the devil is this ethel lloyd stared at the man whose blood ran in his veins even in this embarrassing situation fitz was poised and dignified he was handsome despite the drooping eyelid that resulted from the battle of the somme he leaned on a walking stick another consequence of the somme a few months short of sixty years old he was immaculately groomed his grey hair neatly trimmed his silver tie tightly knotted his black shoes shining lloyd too always liked to look well turned out thats where i get it from he thought ethel went and stood close to the earl lloyd knew his mother well enough to understand this move she frequently used her charm when she wanted to persuade a man all the same lloyd did not like to see her being so warm to one who had exploited her then let her down i was so sorry when i heard about the death of boy she said to fitz nothing is as precious to us as our children is it i must go fitz said until this moment lloyd had met fitz only in passing he had never before spent this much time with him or heard him speak this number of words despite feeling uncomfortable lloyd was fascinated grumpy though he was right now fitz had a kind of allure please fitz said ethel you have a son whom you have never acknowledged a son you should be proud of you shouldnt do this ethel said fitz a man is entitled to forget the mistakes of his youth lloyd cringed with embarrassment but his mother pressed on why should you want to forget i know he was a mistake but look at him now a member of parliament who has just made a thrilling speech and been appointed pps to the foreign secretary fitz pointedly did not look at lloyd ethel said you want to pretend that our affair was a meaningless dalliance but you know the truth yes we were young and foolish and randy too me as much as you but we loved each other we really loved each other fitz you should admit it dont you know that if you deny the truth about yourself you lose your soul fitzs face was no longer merely impassive lloyd saw he was struggling to maintain control lloyd understood that his mother had put her finger on the real problem it was not so much that fitz was ashamed of having an illegitimate son he was too proud to accept that he had loved a housemaid he probably loved ethel more than his wife lloyd guessed and that upset all his most fundamental beliefs about the social hierarchy lloyd spoke for the first time i was with boy at the end sir he died bravely for the first time fitz looked at him my son doesnt require your approval he said lloyd felt as if he had been slapped even ethel was shocked fitz she said how can you be so mean at that point daisy came in hello fitz she said gaily you probably thought youd got rid of me but now youre my fatherinlaw again isnt that amusing ethel said im just trying to persuade fitz to shake lloyds hand fitz said i try to avoid shaking hands with socialists ethel was fighting a losing battle but she would not give up see how much of yourself there is in him he resembles you dresses like you shares your interest in politics hell probably end up foreign secretary which you always wanted to be fitzs expression darkened further it is now most unlikely that i shall ever be foreign secretary he went to the door and it would not please me in the least if that great office of state were to be held by my bolshevik bastard with that he walked out ethel burst into tears daisy put her arm around lloyd im so sorry she said dont worry lloyd said im not shocked or disappointed this was not true but he did not want to appear pathetic i was rejected by him a long time ago he looked at daisy with adoration im lucky to have plenty of other people who love me ethel said tearfully its my fault i shouldnt have asked him to come here i might have known it would turn out badly never mind said daisy i have some good news lloyd smiled at her whats that she looked at ethel are you ready for this i think so come on said lloyd what is it daisy said were going to have a baby iii carlas brother erik came home that summer near to death he had contracted tuberculosis in a soviet labour camp and they had released him when he became too ill to work he had been sleeping rough for weeks travelling on freight trains and begging lifts on lorries he arrived at the von ulrich house barefoot and wearing filthy clothes his face was like a skull however he did not die it might have been being with people who loved him or the warmer weather as winter turned into spring or perhaps just rest but he coughed less and regained enough energy to do some work around the house boarding up smashed windows repairing roof tiles unblocking pipes fortunately at the beginning of the year frieda franck had struck gold ludwig franck had been killed in the air raid that destroyed his factory and for a while frieda and her mother had been as destitute as everyone else but she got a job as a nurse in the american zone and soon afterwards she explained to carla a little group of american doctors had asked her to sell their surplus food and cigarettes on the black market in exchange for a cut of the proceeds thereafter she turned up at carlas house once a week with a little basket of supplies warm clothing candles flashlight batteries matches soap and food bacon chocolate apples rice canned peaches maud divided the food into portions and gave carla double carla accepted without hesitation not for her own sake but to help her feed baby walli without friedas illicit groceries walli might not have made it he was changing fast the dark hair with which he had been born had now gone and instead he had fine fair hair at six months he had mauds wonderful green eyes as his face took shape carla noticed a fold of flesh in the outer corners of his eyes that gave him a slanteyed look and she wondered if his father had been a siberian she could not remember all the men who had raped her most of the time she had closed her eyes she no longer hated them it was strange but she was so happy to have walli that she could hardly bring herself to regret what had happened rebecca was fascinated by walli now just fifteen she was old enough to have the beginnings of maternal feelings and she eagerly helped carla bathe and dress the baby she played with him constantly and he gurgled with delight when he saw her as soon as erik felt well enough he joined the communist party carla was baffled after what he had suffered at the hands of the soviets how could he but she found that he talked about communism in the same way he had talked about nazism a decade earlier she just hoped that this time his disillusionment would not be so long coming the allies were keen for democracy to return to germany and city elections were scheduled for berlin later in carla felt sure the city would not return to normal until its own people took control so she decided to stand for the social democratic party but berliners quickly discovered that the soviet occupiers had a curious notion of what democracy meant the soviets had been shocked by the results of elections in austria the previous november the austrian communists had expected to run neckandneck with the socialists but had won only four seats out of it seemed that voters blamed communism for the brutality of the red army the kremlin unused to genuine elections had not anticipated that to avoid a similar result in germany the soviets proposed a merger between the communists and the social democrats in what they called a united front the social democrats refused despite heavy pressure in east germany the russians started arresting social democrats just as the nazis had in there the merger was forced through but the berlin elections were supervised by the four allies and the social democrats survived once the weather warmed up carla was able to take her turn queuing for food she carried walli with her wrapped in a pillowcase she had no baby clothes standing in line for potatoes one morning a few blocks from home she was surprised to see an american jeep pull up with frieda in the passenger seat the balding middleaged driver kissed her on the lips and she jumped out she was wearing a sleeveless blue dress and new shoes she walked quickly away heading for the von ulrich house carrying her little basket carla saw everything in a flash frieda was not trading on the black market and there was no syndicate of doctors she was the paid mistress of an american officer it was not unusual thousands of pretty german girls had been faced with the choice see your family starve or sleep with a generous officer french women had done the same under german occupation officers wives back here in germany had spoken bitterly about it all the same carla was horrified she believed that frieda loved heinrich they were planning to get married as soon as life returned to some semblance of normality carla felt sick at heart she reached the head of the line and bought her ration of potatoes then hurried home she found frieda upstairs in the drawing room erik had cleaned up the room and put newspaper in the windows the next best thing to glass the curtains had long ago been recycled as bed linen but most of the chairs had survived so far their upholstery faded and worn the grand piano was still there miraculously a russian officer had discovered it and announced that he would return next day with a crane to lift it out through the window but he had never come back frieda immediately took walli from carla and began to sing to him a b c die katze lief im schnee the women who had not yet had children rebecca and frieda could hardly get enough of walli carla observed those who had had children of their own maud and ada adored him but dealt with him in a briskly practical way frieda opened the lid of the piano and encouraged walli to bang on the keys as she sang the instrument had not been played for years maud had not touched it since the death of her last pupil joachim koch after a few minutes frieda said to carla youre a bit solemn what is it i know how you get the food you bring us carla said youre not a black marketeer are you of course i am frieda said what are you talking about i saw you this morning getting out of a jeep colonel hicks gave me a lift he kissed you on the lips frieda looked away i knew i should have got out earlier i could have walked from the american zone frieda what about heinrich hell never know ill be more careful i swear do you still love him of course were going to get married then why ive had enough of hard times i want to put on pretty clothes and go to nightclubs and dance no you dont carla said confidently you cant lie to me frieda weve been friends too long tell me the truth the truth yes please youre sure im sure i did it for walli carla gasped with shock that had never occurred to her but it made sense she could believe frieda would make such a sacrifice for her and her baby but she felt dreadful this made her responsible for friedas prostituting herself this is terrible carla said you shouldnt have done it we would have managed somehow frieda sprang up from the piano stool with the baby still in her arms no you wouldnt she blazed walli was frightened and cried carla took him and rocked him patting his back you wouldnt have managed frieda said more quietly how do you know all last winter babies were brought into the hospital naked wrapped in newspapers dead of hunger and cold i could hardly bear to look at them oh god carla held walli tight they turn a peculiar bluish colour when they freeze to death stop it i have to tell you otherwise you wont understand what i did walli would have been one of those blue frozen babies i know carla whispered i know percy hicks is a kind man he has a frumpy wife back in boston and im the sexiest thing hes ever seen hes nice and quick about intercourse and always uses a condom you should stop carla said you dont mean that no i dont carla confessed and thats the worst part i feel so guilty i am guilty youre not its my choice german women have to make hard choices were paying for the easy choices german men made fifteen years ago men such as my father who thought hitler would be good for business and heinrichs father who voted for the enabling act the sins of the fathers are visited on the daughters there was a loud knock at the front door a moment later they heard scampering steps as rebecca hurried upstairs to hide just in case it was the red army then adas voice said oh sir good morning she sounded surprised and a bit worried though not scared carla wondered who would induce that particular mixture of reactions in the maid there was a heavy masculine tread on the stairs then werner walked in he was dirty and ragged and thin as a rail but there was a broad smile on his handsome face its me he said ebulliently im back then he saw the baby his jaw dropped and the happy smile disappeared oh he said what who whose baby is that mine my darling said carla let me explain explain he said angrily what explanation is necessary youve had someone elses baby he turned to go frieda said werner in this room are two women who love you dont walk out without listening to us you dont understand i think i understand everything carla was raped he went pale raped who by carla said i never knew their names names werner swallowed there there was more than one five red army soldiers his voice fell to a whisper five carla nodded but couldnt you i mean frieda said i was raped too werner and so was mother dear god what has been going on here hell said frieda werner sat down heavily in a worn leather chair i thought hell was where ive been he said he buried his face in his hands carla crossed the room still holding walli and stood in front of werners chair look at me werner she said please he looked up his face twisted with emotion hell is over she said is it yes she said firmly life is hard but the nazis have gone the war is finished hitler is dead and the red army rapists have been brought under control more or less the nightmare has ended and were both alive and together he reached out and took her hand youre right weve got walli and in a minute youll meet a fifteenyearold girl called rebecca who has somehow become my child we have to make a new family out of what the war has left us just as we have to build new houses with the rubble in the streets he nodded acceptance i need your love she said so do rebecca and walli he stood up slowly she looked at him expectantly he said nothing but after a long moment he put his arms around her and the baby gently embracing them both iv under wartime regulations still in force the british government had a right to open a coal mine anywhere regardless of the wishes of the owner of the land compensation was paid only for loss of earnings on farmland or commercial property billy williams as minister for coal authorized an opencast mine in the grounds of tŷ gwyn the palatial residence of earl fitzherbert on the outskirts of aberowen no compensation was payable as the land was not commercial there was uproar on the conservative benches in the house of commons your slag heap will be right under the bedroom windows of the countess said one indignant tory billy williams smiled the earls slag heap has been under my mothers window for fifty years he said lloyd williams and ethel both travelled to aberowen with billy the day before the engineers began to dig the hole lloyd was reluctant to leave daisy who was due to give birth in two weeks but it was a historic moment and he wanted to be there both his grandparents were now in their late seventies granda was almost blind despite his pebblelensed glasses and grandmam was bentbacked this is nice grandmam said when they all sat around the old kitchen table both my children here she served stewed beef with mashed turnips and thick slices of homemade bread spread with the butchers fat called dripping she poured large mugs of sweetened milky tea to go with it lloyd had eaten like this frequently as a child but now he found it coarse he knew that even in hard times french and spanish women managed to serve up tasty dishes delicately flavoured with garlic and garnished with herbs he was ashamed of his fastidiousness and pretended to eat and drink with relish pity about the gardens at tŷ gwyn grandmam said tactlessly billy was stung what do you mean britain needs the coal but people love those gardens beautiful they are ive been there at least once every year since i was a girl shame it is to see them go theres a perfectly good recreation ground right in the middle of aberowen its not the same said grandmam imperturbably granda said women will never understand politics no said grandmam i dont suppose we will lloyd caught his mothers eye she smiled and said nothing billy and lloyd shared the second bedroom and ethel made up a bed on the kitchen floor i slept in this room every night of my life until i went in the army billy said as they lay down and i looked out the window every morning at that fucking slag heap keep your voice down uncle billy lloyd said you dont want your mother to hear you swear aye youre right said billy next morning after breakfast they all walked up the hill to the big house it was a mild morning and for a change there was no rain the ridge of mountains at the skyline was softened with summer grass as tŷ gwyn came into view lloyd could not help seeing it more as a beautiful building than as a symbol of oppression it was both of course nothing was simple in politics the great iron gates stood open the williams family passed into the grounds a crowd had gathered already the contractors men with their machinery a hundred or so miners and their families earl fitzherbert with his son andrew a handful of reporters with notebooks and a film crew the gardens were breathtaking the avenue of ancient chestnut trees was in full leaf there were swans on the lake and the flower beds blazed with colour lloyd guessed the earl had made sure the place looked its best he wanted to brand the labour government as wreckers in the eyes of the world lloyd found himself sympathizing with fitz the mayor of aberowen was giving an interview the people of this town are against the opencast mine he said lloyd was surprised the town council was labour and it must have gone against the grain for them to oppose the government for more than a hundred years the beauty of these gardens has refreshed the souls of people who live in a grim industrial landscape the mayor went on switching from prepared speech to personal reminiscence he added i proposed to my wife under that cedar tree he was interrupted by a loud clanking sound like the footsteps of an iron giant turning to look back along the drive lloyd saw a huge machine approaching it looked like the biggest crane in the world it had an enormous boom ninety feet long and a bucket into which a lorry could easily fit most astonishing of all it moved along on rotating steel shoes that made the earth shake every time they hit the ground billy said proudly to lloyd thats a walking monighan dragline excavator picks up six tons of earth at a time the film camera rolled as the monstrous machine stomped up the drive lloyd had only one misgiving about the labour party there was a streak of puritan authoritarianism in many socialists his grandfather had it and so did billy they were not comfortable with sensual pleasures sacrifice and selfdenial suited them better they dismissed the ravishing beauty of these gardens as irrelevant they were wrong ethel was not that way nor was lloyd perhaps the killjoy strain had been bred out of their line he hoped so fitz gave an interview on the pink gravel path while the digger driver manoeuvred his machine into position the minister for coal has told you that when the mine is exhausted the garden will be subject to what he calls an effective restoration programme he said i say to you that that promise is worthless it has taken more than a century for my grandfather and my father and i to bring the garden to its present pitch of beauty and harmony it would take another hundred years to restore it the boom of the excavator was lowered until it stood at a fortyfivedegree angle over the shrubbery and flower beds of the west garden the bucket was positioned over the croquet lawn there was a long moment of waiting the crowd fell silent billy said loudly get on with it for gods sake an engineer in a bowler hat blew a whistle the bucket was dropped to the earth with a massive thud its steel teeth dug into the flat green lawn the drag rope tautened there was a loud creak of straining machinery then the bucket began to move back as it was dragged across the ground it dug up a bed of huge yellow sunflowers the rose garden a shrubbery of summersweet and bottlebrush buckeye and a small magnolia tree at the end of its travel the bucket was full of earth flowers and plants the bucket was then lifted to a height of twenty feet dribbling loose earth and blossoms the boom swung sideways it was taller than the house lloyd saw he almost thought the bucket would smash the upstairs windows but the operator was skilled and stopped it just in time the drag rope slackened the bucket tilted and six tons of garden fell to the ground a few feet from the entrance the bucket was returned to its original position and the process was repeated lloyd looked at fitz and saw that he was crying at the beginning of it seemed possible that all europe might go communist volodya peshkov was not sure whether to hope for that or its opposite the red army dominated eastern europe and communists were winning elections in the west communists had gained respect for their role in resisting the nazis five million people had voted communist in the first french postwar election making the communists the most popular party in italy a communistsocialist alliance won per cent of the vote in czechoslovakia the communists on their own won per cent and led the democratically elected government it was different in austria and germany where voters had been robbed and raped by the red army in the berlin city elections the social democrats won of seats the communists only however germany was ruined and starving and the kremlin still hoped that the people might turn to communism in desperation just as they had turned to nazism in the depression britain was the great disappointment only one communist had been sent to parliament in the postwar election there and the labour government was delivering everything communism promised welfare free health care education for all even a fiveday week for coal miners but in the rest of europe capitalism was failing to lift people out of the postwar slump and the weather was on stalins side volodya thought as the layers of snow grew thick on the onion domes the winter of was the coldest in europe for more than a century snow fell in st tropez british roads and railways became impassable and industry ground to a halt something that had never happened in the war in france food rations fell below wartime levels the united nations organization calculated that million europeans were living on calories a day the level at which health begins to suffer from the effects of malnutrition as the engines of production ran slower and slower people began to feel they had nothing to lose and revolution came to seem the only way out once the ussr had nuclear weapons no other country would be able to stand in its way volodyas wife zoya and her colleagues had built a nuclear pile at laboratory no of the academy of sciences a deliberately vague name for the powerhouse of soviet nuclear research the pile had gone critical on christmas day six months after the birth of konstantin who was at the time sleeping in the laboratorys crèche if the experiment went wrong zoya had whispered to volodya it would do little kotya no good to be a mile or two away all of central moscow would be flattened volodyas conflicting feelings about the future took on a new intensity with the birth of his son he wanted kotya to grow up a citizen of a proud and powerful country the soviet union deserved to dominate europe he felt it was the red army that had defeated the nazis in four cruel years of total warfare the other allies had stood on the sidelines fighting minor wars joining in only for the last eleven months all their casualties put together were only a fraction of those suffered by the soviet people but then he would think of what communism meant arbitrary purges torture in the basements of the secret police conquering soldiers urged on to excesses of bestiality the whole vast country forced to obey the wayward decisions of a tyrant more powerful than a tsar did volodya really want to extend that brutal system to the rest of the continent he remembered walking into penn station in new york and buying a ticket to albuquerque without asking anyones permission or showing any papers and the exhilarating sense of total freedom that had given him he had long ago burned the searsroebuck catalogue but it lived in his memory with its hundreds of pages of good things available for everyone to have russian people believed that stories of western freedom and prosperity were just propaganda but volodya knew better a part of him longed for communism to be defeated the future of germany and therefore of europe was to be decided at the conference of foreign ministers held in moscow in march volodya now a colonel was in charge of the intelligence team assigned to the conference meetings were held in an ornate room at aviation industry house conveniently close to the hotel moskva as always the delegates and their interpreters sat around a table with their aides on several rows of chairs behind them the soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov old stone arse demanded that germany pay ten billion dollars to the ussr in war reparations the americans and british protested that this would be a death blow to germanys sickly economy that was probably what stalin wanted volodya renewed his acquaintance with woody dewar who was now a news photographer assigned to cover the conference he was married too and showed volodya a photo of a striking darkhaired woman holding a baby sitting in the back of a zisb limousine returning from a formal photo session at the kremlin woody said to volodya you realize that germany doesnt have the money to pay your reparations dont you volodyas english had improved and they could manage without an interpreter he said then how are they feeding their people and rebuilding their cities with handouts from us of course said woody were spending a fortune in aid any reparations the germans paid you would be in reality our money is that so wrong the united states prospered in the war my country was devastated maybe you should pay american voters dont think so american voters may be wrong woody shrugged true but its their money there it was again volodya thought the deference to public opinion he had remarked on it before in woodys conversation americans talked about voters the way russians talked about stalin they had to be obeyed right or wrong woody wound down the window you dont mind if i take a cityscape do you the light is wonderful his camera clicked he knew he was supposed to take only approved shots however there was nothing sensitive on the street just some women shovelling snow all the same volodya said please dont he leaned past woody and wound up the window official photos only he was about to ask for the film out of woodys camera when woody said do you remember me mentioning my friend greg peshkov with the same surname as you volodya certainly did willi frunze had said something similar it was probably the same man no i dont remember volodya lied he wanted nothing to do with a possible relative in the west such connections brought suspicion and trouble to russians hes on the american delegation you should talk to him see if youre related i will said volodya resolving to avoid the man at all costs he decided not to insist on taking woodys film it was not worth the fuss for a harmless street scene at the next days conference the american secretary of state george marshall proposed that the four allies should abolish the separate sectors of germany and unify the country so that it could once again become the beating economic heart of europe mining and manufacturing and buying and selling that was the last thing the soviets wanted molotov refused to discuss unification until the question of reparations had been settled the conference was stalemated and that volodya thought was exactly where stalin wanted it ii the world of international diplomacy was a small one greg peshkov reflected one of the young aides in the british delegation at the moscow conference was lloyd williams the husband of gregs halfsister daisy at first greg did not like the look of lloyd who was dressed like a prissy english gentleman but he turned out to be a regular guy molotov is a prick lloyd said in the bar of the hotel moskva over a couple of vodka martinis so what are we going to do about him i dont know but britain cant live with these delays the occupation of germany is costing money we cant afford and the hard winter has turned the problem into a crisis you know what said greg thinking aloud if the soviets wont play ball we should just go ahead without them how could we do that what do we want greg counted points on his fingers we want to unify germany and hold elections so do we we want to scrap the worthless reichsmark and introduce a new currency so that germans can start to do business again yes and we want to save the country from communism also british policy we cant do it in the east because the soviets wont come to the party so fuck them we control three quarters of germany lets do it in our zone and let the eastern part of the country go to blazes lloyd looked thoughtful is this something youve discussed with your boss hell no im just running off at the mouth but listen why not i might suggest it to ernie bevin and ill put it to george marshall greg sipped his drink vodka is the only thing the russians do well he said so hows my sister shes expecting our second baby what is daisy like as a mother lloyd laughed you think shes probably terrible greg shrugged i never saw her as the domestic type shes patient calm and organized she didnt hire six nurses to do all the work just one so that she can come out with me in the evenings usually to political meetings wow shes changed not completely she still loves parties what about you still single theres a girl called nelly fordham that im pretty serious about and i guess you know that i have a godson yes said lloyd daisy told me all about him georgy greg felt sure from the slightly embarrassed look on lloyds face that he knew georgy was gregs child im very fond of him thats great a member of the russian delegation came up to the bar and greg caught his eye there was something very familiar about him he was in his thirties handsome apart from a brutally short military haircut and he had a slightly intimidating blueeyed gaze he nodded in a friendly way and greg said have we met before perhaps the russian said i was at school in germany the berlin boys academy greg shook his head ever been to the states no lloyd said this is the guy with the same surname as you volodya peshkov greg introduced himself we might be related my father lev peshkov emigrated in leaving behind a pregnant girlfriend who then married his older brother grigori peshkov could we be halfbrothers volodyas manner altered immediately definitely not he said excuse me he left the bar without buying a drink that was abrupt greg said to lloyd it was said lloyd he looked kind of shocked it must have been something you said iii it could not be true volodya told himself greg claimed that grigori had married a girl who was already pregnant by lev if that was the case the man volodya had always called father was not his father but his uncle perhaps it was a coincidence or the american could just be stirring up trouble all the same volodya was reeling with shock he returned home at his usual time he and zoya were rising fast and had been given an apartment in government house the luxury block where his parents lived grigori and katerina came to the apartment at kotyas suppertime as they did most evenings katerina bathed her grandson then grigori sang to him and told him russian fairy tales kotya was nine months old and not yet talking but he seemed to like bedtime stories just the same volodya followed the evening routine as if sleepwalking he tried to behave normally but he found he could hardly speak to either of his parents he did not believe gregs story but he could not stop thinking about it when kotya was asleep and the grandparents were about to leave grigori said to volodya have i got a boil on my nose no then why have you been staring at me all evening volodya decided to tell the truth i met a man called greg peshkov hes part of the american delegation he thinks were related its possible grigoris tone was light as if it did not much matter but volodya saw that his neck had reddened a giveaway sign of suppressed emotion in his father i last saw my brother in since then i havent heard from him gregs father is called lev and lev had a brother called grigori then greg could be your cousin he said brother grigoris blush deepened and he said nothing zoya put in how could that be volodya said according to this american peshkov lev had a pregnant girlfriend in st petersburg who married his brother grigori said ridiculous volodya looked at katerina you havent said anything mother there was a long pause that in itself was significant what did they have to think about if there was no truth in gregs story a weird coldness descended on volodya like a freezing fog at last his mother said i was a flighty girl she looked at zoya not sensible like your wife she sighed deeply grigori peshkov fell in love with me more or less at first sight poor idiot she smiled fondly at her husband but his brother lev had fancy clothes cigarettes money for vodka gangster friends i liked lev better more fool me volodya said amazedly so its true part of him still hoped desperately for a denial lev did what such men always do katerina said he made me pregnant then left me so lev is my father volodya looked at grigori and youre just my uncle he felt as if he might fall over the ground under his feet had shifted it was like an earthquake zoya stood beside volodyas chair and put her hand on his shoulder as if to calm him or perhaps restrain him katerina went on and grigori did what men such as grigori always do he took care of me he loved me he married me and he provided for me and my children sitting on the couch next to grigori she took his hand i didnt want him and i certainly didnt deserve him but god gave him to me anyway grigori said i have dreaded this day ever since you were born i have dreaded it volodya said then why did you keep the secret why didnt you just speak the truth grigori was choked up and spoke with difficulty i couldnt bear to tell you that i wasnt your father he managed to say i loved you too much katerina said let me tell you something my beloved son listen to me now and i dont care if you never listen to your mother again but hear this forget the stranger in america who once seduced a foolish girl look at the man sitting in front of you with tears in his eyes volodya looked at grigori and saw a pleading expression that tugged at his heart katerina went on this man has fed you and clothed you and loved you unfailingly for three decades if the word father means anything at all this is your father yes volodya said i know that iv lloyd williams got on well with ernie bevin they had a lot in common despite the age difference during the fourday train journey across snowy europe lloyd had confided that he like bevin was the illegitimate son of a housemaid they were both passionate anticommunists lloyd because of his experiences in spain bevin because he had seen communist tactics in the trade union movement theyre slaves to the kremlin and tyrants over everyone else bevin said and lloyd knew exactly what he meant lloyd had not warmed to greg peshkov who always looked as if he had dressed in a rush shirtsleeves unbuttoned coat collar twisted shoelaces untied greg was shrewd and lloyd tried to like him but he felt that underneath gregs casual charm there was a core of ruthlessness daisy had said that lev peshkov was a gangster and lloyd could imagine that greg had the same instincts however bevin jumped at gregs idea for germany was he speaking for marshall do you suppose said the portly foreign secretary in his broad west country accent he said not lloyd replied do you think it could work i think its the best idea ive heard in three bloody weeks in bloody moscow if hes serious arrange an informal lunch just marshall and this youngster with you and me ill do it right away but tell nobody we dont want the soviets to get a whisper of this theyll accuse us of conspiring against them and theyll be right they met the following day at no spasopeskovskaya square the american ambassadors residence an extravagant neoclassical mansion built before the revolution marshall was tall and lean every inch a soldier bevin rotund nearsighted a cigarette frequently dangling from his lips but they clicked immediately both were plainspeaking men bevin had once been accused of ungentlemanly speech by stalin himself a distinction of which the foreign secretary was very proud beneath the painted ceilings and chandeliers they got down to the task of reviving germany without the help of the ussr they agreed rapidly on the principles the new currency the unification of the british american and if possible french zones the demilitarization of west germany elections and a new transatlantic military alliance then bevin said bluntly none of this will work you know marshall was taken aback then i fail to understand why were discussing it he said sharply europes in a slump this scheme will fail if people are starving the best protection against communism is prosperity stalin knows that which is why he wants to keep germany impoverished i agree which means weve got to rebuild but we cant do it with our bare hands we need tractors lathes excavators rolling stock all of which we cant afford marshall saw where he was going americans arent willing to give europeans any more handouts fair enough but there must be a way the usa can lend us the money we need to buy equipment from you there was a silence marshall hated to waste words but this was a long pause even by his standards then at last he spoke it makes sense he said ill see what i can do the conference lasted six weeks and when they all went home again nothing had been decided v eva williams was a year old when she got her back teeth the others had come fairly easily but these hurt there was not much lloyd and daisy could do for her she was miserable she could not sleep she would not let them sleep and they were miserable too daisy had a lot of money but they lived unostentatiously they had bought a pleasant row house in hoxton where their neighbours were a shopkeeper and a builder they got a small family car a new morris eight with a top speed of almost sixty miles per hour daisy still bought pretty clothes but lloyd had just three suits evening dress a chalk stripe for the house of commons and tweeds for constituency work at the weekends lloyd was in his pyjamas late one evening trying to rock the grizzling evie to sleep and at the same time leafing through life magazine he noticed a striking photograph taken in moscow it showed a russian woman wearing a headscarf and a coat tied with string like a parcel her old face deeply lined shovelling snow on the street something about the way the light struck her gave her a look of timelessness as if she had been there for a thousand years he looked for the photographers name and found it was woody dewar whom he had met at the conference the phone rang he picked it up and heard the voice of ernie bevin turn your wireless on bevin said marshalls made a speech he hung up without waiting for a reply lloyd went downstairs to the living room still carrying evie and switched on the radio the show was called american commentary the bbcs washington correspondent leonard miall was reporting from harvard university in cambridge massachusetts the secretary of state told alumni that the rebuilding of europe is going to take a longer time and require a greater effort than was originally foreseen said miall that was promising lloyd thought with excitement hush evie please he said and for once she quietened then lloyd heard the low reasonable voice of george c marshall europes requirements for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products principally from america are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional help or face economic social and political deterioration of a very grave character lloyd was electrified substantial additional help was what bevin had asked for the remedy lies in breaking the vicious circle and restoring the confidence of the european people in the economic future marshall said the united states should do whatever it is able to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world hes done it lloyd said triumphantly to his uncomprehending baby daughter hes told america they have to give us aid but how much and how and when the voice changed and the reporter said the secretary of state did not outline a detailed plan for aid to europe but said it was up to the europeans to draft the programme does that mean we have carte blanche lloyd eagerly asked evie marshalls voice returned to say the initiative i think must come from europe the report ended and the phone rang again did you hear that said bevin what does it mean dont ask said bevin if you ask questions youll get answers you dont want all right lloyd said baffled never mind what he meant the question is what we do the initiative must come from europe he said that means me and you what can i do pack a bag said bevin were going to paris volodya was in prague as part of a red army delegation holding talks with the czech military they were staying in art deco splendour at the imperial hotel it was snowing he missed zoya and little kotya his son was two years old and learning new words at bewildering speed the child was changing so fast that he seemed different every day and zoya was pregnant again volodya resented having to spend two weeks apart from his family most of the men in the group saw the trip as a chance to get away from their wives drink too much vodka and maybe fool around with loose women volodya just wanted to go home the military talks were genuine but volodyas part in them was a cover for his real assignment which was to report on the activities in prague of the hamfisted soviet secret police perennial rivals of red army intelligence volodya had little enthusiasm for his work nowadays everything he had once believed in had been undermined he no longer had faith in stalin communism or the essential goodness of the russian people even his father was not his father he would have defected to the west if he could have found a way of getting zoya and kotya out with him however he did have his heart in his mission here in prague it was a rare chance to do something he believed in two weeks ago the czech communist party had taken full control of the government ousting their coalition partners foreign minister jan masaryk a war hero and democratic anticommunist had become a prisoner on the top floor of his official residence the czernin palace the soviet secret police had undoubtedly been behind the coup in fact volodyas brotherinlaw colonel ilya dvorkin was also in prague staying at the same hotel and had almost certainly been involved volodyas boss general lemitov saw the coup as a public relations catastrophe for the ussr masaryk had constituted proof to the world that east european countries could be free and independent in the shadow of the ussr he had enabled czechoslovakia to have a communist government friendly to the soviet union and at the same time wear the costume of bourgeois democracy this had been the perfect arrangement for it gave the ussr everything it wanted while reassuring the americans but that equilibrium had been upset however ilya was crowing the bourgeois parties have been smashed he said to volodya in the hotel bar one night did you see what happened in the american senate volodya said mildly vandenberg the old isolationist made an eightyminute speech in favour of the marshall plan and he was cheered to the rafters george marshalls vague ideas had become a plan this was mainly thanks to the ratlike cunning of british foreign secretary ernie bevin in volodyas opinion bevin was the most dangerous kind of anticommunist a workingclass social democrat despite his bulk he moved fast with lightning speed he had organized a conference in paris that had given a resounding collective european welcome to george marshalls harvard speech volodya knew from spies in the british foreign office that bevin was determined to bring germany into the marshall plan and keep the ussr out and stalin had fallen straight into bevins trap by commanding the east european countries to repudiate marshall aid now the soviet secret police seemed to be doing all they could to assist the passage of the bill through congress the senate was all set to reject marshall volodya said to ilya american taxpayers dont want to foot the bill but the coup here in prague has persuaded them that they have to because european capitalism is in danger of collapse ilya said indignantly the bourgeois czech parties wanted to take the american bribe we should have let them said volodya it might have been the quickest way to sabotage the whole scheme congress would then have rejected the marshall plan they dont want to give money to communists the marshall plan is an imperialist trick yes it is said volodya and im afraid its working our wartime allies are forming an antisoviet bloc people who obstruct the forward march of communism must be dealt with appropriately indeed they must it was amazing how consistently people such as ilya made the wrong political judgements and i must go to bed it was only ten but volodya went too he lay awake thinking about zoya and kotya and wishing he could kiss them both goodnight his thoughts drifted to his mission he had met jan masaryk the symbol of czech independence two days earlier at a ceremony at the grave of his father thomas masaryk the founder and first president of czechoslovakia dressed in a coat with a fur collar head bared to the falling snow the second masaryk had seemed beaten and depressed if he could be persuaded to stay on as foreign minister some compromise might be possible volodya mused czechoslovakia could have a thoroughly communist domestic government but in its international relations it might be neutral or at least minimally antiamerican masaryk had both the diplomatic skills and the international credibility to walk that tightrope volodya decided he would suggest it to lemitov tomorrow he slept fitfully and woke before six oclock with a mental alarm ringing in his imagination it was something about last nights conversation with ilya volodya ran over it again in his mind when ilya had said people who obstruct the forward march of communism he had been talking about masaryk and when a secret policeman said someone had to be dealt with appropriately he always meant killed then ilya had gone to bed early which suggested an early start this morning im a fool volodya thought the signs were there and it took me all night to read them he leaped out of bed perhaps he was not too late he dressed quickly and put on a heavy overcoat scarf and hat there were no taxis outside the hotel it was too early he could have called a red army car but by the time a driver was awakened and the car brought it would take the best part of an hour he set out to walk the czernin palace was only a mile or two away he headed west out of pragues gracious city centre crossed the st charles bridge and hurried uphill towards the castle masaryk was not expecting him nor was the foreign minister obliged to give audience to a red army colonel but volodya felt sure masaryk would be curious enough to see him he walked fast through the snow and reached the czernin palace at sixfortyfive it was a huge baroque building with a grandiose row of corinthian halfcolumns on the three upper storeys the place was lightly guarded he found to his surprise a sentry pointed to the front door volodya walked unchallenged through an ornate hall he had expected to find the usual secret police moron behind a reception desk but there was no one this was a bad sign and he was filled with foreboding the hall led to an inner courtyard glancing through a window he saw what looked like a man sleeping in the snow perhaps he had fallen there drunk if so he was in danger of freezing to death volodya tried the door and found it open he ran across the quadrangle a man in blue silk pyjamas lay face down on the ground there was no snow covering him so he could not have been there many minutes volodya knelt beside him the man was quite still and did not appear to be breathing volodya looked up rows of identical windows like soldiers on parade looked into this courtyard all were closed tightly against the freezing weather except one high above the man in pyjamas that stood wide open as if someone had been thrown out of it volodya turned the lifeless head and looked at the mans face it was jan masaryk ii three days later in washington the joint chiefs of staff presented to president truman an emergency war plan to meet a soviet invasion of western europe the danger of a third world war was a hot topic in the press we just won the war jacky jakes said to greg peshkov how come were about to have another thats what i keep asking myself said greg they were sitting on a park bench while greg took a breather from throwing a football with georgy im glad hes too young to fight jacky said me too they both looked at their son standing talking to a blonde girl about his age the laces of his keds were undone and his shirt was untucked he was twelve years old and growing up he had a few soft black hairs on his upper lip and he seemed three inches taller than last week weve been bringing our troops home as fast as we can greg said so have the british and the french but the red army stayed put result they now have three times as many soldiers in germany as we do americans dont want another war you can say that again and truman hopes to win the presidential election in november so hes going to do everything he can to avoid war but it may happen anyway youre getting out of the army soon what are you going to do there was a quaver in her voice that made him suspect the question was not as casual as she pretended he looked at her face but her expression was unreadable he answered assuming america is not at war im going to run for congress in my father has agreed to finance my campaign ill start as soon as the presidential election is over she looked away which party she asked the question mechanically he wondered if he had said something to upset her republican of course what about marriage greg was taken aback why do you ask that she was looking hard at him now are you getting married she persisted as it happens i am her name is nelly fordham i thought so how old is she twentytwo what do you mean you thought so a politician needs a wife i love her sure you do is her family in politics her father is a washington lawyer good choice greg felt annoyed youre being very cynical i know you greg good lord i fucked you when you werent much older than georgy is now you can fool everyone except your mother and me she was perceptive as always his mother had also been critical of his engagement they were right it was a career move but nelly was pretty and charming and she adored greg so what was so wrong im meeting her for lunch near here in a few minutes he said jacky said does nelly know about georgy no and we must keep it that way youre right having an illegitimate child is bad enough a black one could ruin your career i know almost as bad as a black wife greg was so surprised that he came right out with it did you think i was going to marry you she looked sour hell no greg if i was given a choice between you and the acid bath murderer id ask for time to think about it she was lying he knew for a moment he contemplated the idea of marrying jacky interracial marriages were unusual and attracted a good deal of hostility from blacks as well as whites but some people did it and put up with the consequences he had never met a girl he liked as much as jacky not even margaret cowdry whom he had dated for a couple of years until she got fed up of waiting for him to propose jacky was sharptongued but he liked that maybe because his mother was the same there was something deeply attractive about the idea of the three of them being together all the time georgy would learn to call him dad they could buy a house in a neighbourhood where people were broadminded some place that had a lot of students and young professors maybe georgetown then he saw georgys blonde friend being called away by her parents a cross white mother wagging a finger in admonition and he realized that marrying jacky was the worst idea in the world georgy returned to where greg and jacky sat hows school greg asked him i like it better than i used to the boy said math is getting more interesting i was good at math greg said jacky said now theres a coincidence greg stood up i have to go he squeezed georgys shoulder keep working on the math buddy sure said georgy greg waved at jacky and left she had been thinking about marriage at the same time as he no doubt she knew that coming out of the army was a decision moment for him it forced him to think about his future she could not really have thought he would marry her but all the same she must have harboured a secret fantasy now he had shattered it well that was too bad even if she had been white he would not have married her he was fond of her and he loved the kid but he had his whole life ahead of him and he wanted a wife who would bring him connections and support nellys father was a powerful man in republican politics he walked to the napoli an italian restaurant a few blocks from the park nelly was already there her copperred curls escaping from under a little green hat you look great he said i hope im not late he sat down nellys face was stony i saw you in the park she said greg thought oh shit i was a little early so i sat for a while she said you didnt notice me then i started to feel like a snoop so i left so you saw my godson he said with forced cheerfulness is that who he is youre a surprising choice for a godfather you never even go to church im good to the kid whats his name georgy jakes youve never mentioned him before havent i how old is he twelve so you were sixteen when he was born thats young to be a godfather i guess it is what does his mother do for a living shes a waitress years ago she was an actress her stage name was jacky jakes i met her when she was under contract to my fathers studio that was more or less true greg thought uncomfortably and his father greg shook his head jacky is single a waiter approached greg said how about a cocktail perhaps it might ease the tension two martinis he said to the waiter right away sir as soon as the waiter had left nelly said youre the boys father arent you godfather her voice became contemptuous oh stop it what makes you so sure he may be black but he looks like you he cant keep his shoelaces tied or his shirt tucked in and nor can you and he was charming the pants off that little blonde girl he was talking to of course hes yours greg gave in he sighed and said i was going to tell you when i was waiting for the right moment before you proposed would have been a good time im sorry he was embarrassed but not really contrite he thought she was making an unnecessary fuss the waiter brought menus and they both looked at them the spaghetti bolognese is great said greg im going to get a salad their martinis arrived greg raised his glass and said to forgiveness in marriage nelly did not pick up her drink i cant marry you she said honey come on dont overreact ive apologized she shook her head you dont get it do you what dont i get that woman sitting on the park bench with you she loves you does she greg would have denied it yesterday but after todays conversation he was not sure of course she does why hasnt she married shes pretty enough by now she could have found a man willing to take on a stepson if shed really been trying but shes in love with you you rotter im not so sure and the boy adores you too im his favourite uncle except that youre not she pushed her glass across the table you have my drink honey please relax im leaving she stood up greg was not used to girls walking out on him he found it unnerving was he losing his allure i want to marry you he said he sounded desperate even to himself you cant marry me greg she said she slipped the diamond ring off her finger and put it down on the red checked tablecloth you already have a family she walked out of the restaurant iii the world crisis came to a head in june and carla and her family were at the centre of it the marshall plan had been signed into law by president truman and the first shipments of aid were arriving in europe to the fury of the kremlin on friday june the western allies alerted germans that they would make an important announcement at eight oclock that evening carlas family gathered around the radio in the kitchen tuned to radio frankfurt and waited anxiously the war had been over for three years yet still they did not know what the future held capitalism or communism unity or fragmentation freedom or subjugation prosperity or destitution werner sat beside carla with walli now two and a half on his knee they had married quietly a year ago carla was working as a nurse again she was also a berlin city councillor for the social democrats so was friedas husband heinrich in east germany the russians had banned the social democratic party but berlin was an oasis in the soviet sector ruled by a council of the four main allies called the kommandatura which had vetoed the ban as a result the social democrats had won and the communists had come a poor third after the conservative christian democrats the russians were incensed and did everything they could to obstruct the elected council carla found it frustrating but she could not give up the hope of independence from the soviets werner had managed to start a small business he had searched through the ruins of his fathers factory and scavenged a small horde of electrical supplies and radio parts germans could not afford to buy new radios but everyone wanted their old ones repaired werner had found some engineers formerly employed at the factory and set them to work fixing broken wireless sets he was the manager and salesman going to houses and apartment buildings knocking on doors drumming up business maud also at the kitchen table this evening worked as an interpreter for the americans she was one of the best and often translated at meetings of the kommandatura carlas brother erik was wearing the uniform of a policeman having joined the communist party to the dismay of his family he had got a job as a police officer in the new east german force organized by the russian occupiers erik said the western allies were trying to split germany in two you social democrats are secessionists he said quoting the communist line in the same way he had parroted nazi propaganda the western allies havent divided anything carla retorted theyve opened the borders between their zones why dont the soviets do the same then we would be one country again he seemed not to hear her rebecca was almost seventeen carla and werner had legally adopted her she was doing well at school and good at languages carla was pregnant again though she had not told werner she was thrilled he had an adopted daughter and a stepson but now he would have a child of his own as well she knew he would be delighted when she told him she was waiting a little longer to be sure but she yearned to know in what kind of country her three children were going to live an american officer called robert lochner came on the air he had been raised in germany and spoke the language effortlessly beginning at seven oclock on monday morning he explained west germany would have a new currency the deutsche mark carla was not surprised the reichsmark was worth less every day most people were paid in reichsmarks if they had a job at all and the currency could be used for basics such as food rations and bus fares but everyone preferred to get groceries or cigarettes werner in his business charged people in reichsmarks but offered overnight service for five cigarettes and delivery anywhere in the city for three eggs carla knew from maud that the new currency had been discussed at the kommandatura the russians had demanded plates so that they could print it but they had debased the old currency by printing too much and there was no point in a new currency if the same thing was going to happen consequently the west refused and the soviets sulked now the west had decided to go ahead without the cooperation of the soviets carla was pleased for the new currency would be good for germany but she felt apprehensive about the soviet reaction people in west germany could exchange sixty inflated old reichsmarks for three deutsche marks and ninety new pennies said lochner then he said that none of this would apply in berlin at least at first whereupon there was a collective groan in the kitchen carla went to bed wondering what the soviets would do she lay beside werner part of her brain listening in case walli in the next room should cry the soviet occupiers had been getting angrier for the last few months a journalist called dieter friede had been kidnapped in the american zone by the soviet secret police then held captive the soviets at first denied all knowledge then said they had arrested him as a spy three students had been expelled from university for criticizing the russians in a magazine worst of all a soviet fighter aircraft buzzed a british european airways passenger plane landing at gatow airport and clipped its wing causing both planes to crash killing four bea crew ten passengers and the soviet pilot when the russians got angry someone else always suffered next morning the soviets announced it would be a crime to import deutsche marks into east germany this included berlin the statement said which is part of the soviet zone the americans immediately denounced this phrase and affirmed that berlin was an international city but the temperature was rising and carla remained anxious on monday west germany got the new currency on tuesday a red army courier came to carlas house and summoned her to city hall she had been summoned this way before but all the same she was fearful as she left home there was nothing to stop the soviets imprisoning her the communists had all the same arbitrary powers the nazis had assumed they were even using the old concentration camps the famous red city hall had been damaged by bombing and the city government was based in the new city hall in parochial strasse both buildings were in the mitte district where carla lived which was in the soviet zone when she got there she found that acting mayor louise schroeder and others had also been called for a meeting with the soviet liaison officer major otshkin he informed them that the east german currency was to be reformed and in future only the new ostmark would be legal in the soviet zone acting mayor schroeder immediately saw the crucial point are you telling us that this will apply in all sectors of berlin yes frau schroeder was not easily intimidated under the city constitution the soviet occupying power cannot make such a rule for the other sectors she said firmly the other allies must be consulted they will not object he handed over a sheet of paper this is marshal sokolovskys decree you will bring it before the city council tomorrow later that evening as carla got into bed with werner she said you can see what the soviet tactic is if the city council were to pass the decree it would be difficult for the democratically minded western allies to overturn it but the council wont pass it the communists are a minority and no one else will want the ostmark no which is why im wondering what marshal sokolovsky has up his sleeve the next mornings newspapers announced that from friday there would be two competing currencies in berlin the ostmark and the deutsche mark it turned out that the americans had secretly flown in million in the new currency in wooden boxes marked clay and bird dog which were now stashed all over berlin during the day carla began to hear rumours from west germany the new money had brought about a miracle there overnight more goods had appeared in shop windows baskets of cherries and neatly tied bundles of carrots from the surrounding countryside butter and eggs and pastries and longhoarded luxuries such as new shoes handbags and even stockings at four deutsche marks the pair people had been waiting until they could sell things for real money that afternoon carla set off for city hall to attend the council meeting scheduled for four oclock as she drew near she saw dozens of red army trucks parked in the streets around the building their drivers lounging around smoking they were mostly american vehicles that must have been given to the ussr as lendlease aid during the war she got an inkling of their purpose when she began to hear the sound of an unruly mob what the soviet governor had up his sleeve she suspected was a truncheon in front of city hall red flags fluttered above a crowd of several thousand most of them wearing communist party badges loudspeaker trucks blared angry speeches and the crowd chanted down with the secessionists carla did not see how she was going to reach the building a handful of policemen looked on uninterestedly making no attempt to help councillors get through it reminded carla painfully of the attitude of police on the day the brownshirts had trashed her mothers office fifteen years ago she was quite sure the communist councillors were already inside and that if social democrats did not get into the building the minority would pass the decree and claim it to be valid she took a deep breath and began to push through the crowd for a few steps she made progress unnoticed then someone recognized her american whore he yelled pointing at her she pressed on determinedly someone else spat at her and a gob of saliva smeared her dress she kept going but she felt panicky she was surrounded by people who hated her something she had never experienced and it made her want to run away she was shoved but managed to keep her feet a hand grasped her dress and she pulled free with a tearing sound she wanted to scream what would they do rip all her clothes off someone else was fighting his way through the crowd behind her she realized and she looked back and saw heinrich von kessel friedas husband he drew level with her and they barrelled on together heinrich was more aggressive stamping on toes and vigorously elbowing everyone within range and together they moved faster and at last reached the door and went in but their ordeal was not over there were communist demonstrators inside too hundreds of them they had to fight through the corridors in the meeting hall the demonstrators were everywhere not just in the visitors gallery but on the floor of the chamber their behaviour here was just as aggressive as outside some social democrats were here and others arrived after carla somehow most of the sixtythree had been able to fight their way through the mob she was relieved the enemy had not managed to scare them off when the speaker of the assembly called for order a communist assemblyman standing on a bench urged the demonstrators to stay when he saw carla he yelled traitors stay outside it was all grimly reminiscent of bullying intimidation and democracy being undermined by rowdyism carla was in despair glancing up to the gallery she was appalled to see her brother erik among the yelling mob youre german she screamed at him you lived under the nazis have you learned nothing he seemed not to hear her frau schroeder stood on the platform calling for calm she was jeered and booed by the demonstrators raising her voice to a shout she said if the city council cannot hold an orderly debate in this building i will move the meeting to the american sector there was renewed abuse but the twentysix communist councillors saw that this move would not suit their purpose if the council met outside the soviet zone once it might do so again and even move permanently out of the range of communist intimidation after a short discussion one of them stood up and told the demonstrators to leave they filed out singing the internationale its obvious whose command theyre under heinrich said at last there was quiet frau schroeder explained the soviet demand and said that it could not apply outside the soviet sector of berlin unless it was ratified by the other allies a communist deputy made a speech accusing her of taking orders directly from new york accusations and abuse raged to and fro eventually they voted the communists unanimously backed the soviet decree after accusing others of being controlled from outside everyone else voted against and the motion was defeated berlin had refused to be bullied carla felt wearily triumphant however it was not yet over by the time they left it was seven oclock in the evening most of the mob had disappeared but there was a thuggish hardcore still hanging around the entrance an elderly woman councillor was kicked and punched as she left the police looked on with indifference carla and heinrich left by a side door with a few friends hoping to depart unobserved but a communist on a bicycle was monitoring the exit he rode off quickly as the councillors hurried away he returned at the head of a small gang someone tripped carla and she fell to the ground she was kicked painfully once twice three times terrified she covered her belly with her hands she was almost three months pregnant the stage at which most miscarriages occurred she knew will werners baby die she thought desperately kicked to death on a berlin street by communist thugs then they disappeared the councillors picked themselves up no one was badly injured they moved off together fearful of a recurrence but it seemed the communists had roughed up enough people for one day carla got home at eight oclock there was no sign of erik werner was shocked to see her bruises and torn dress what happened he said are you all right she burst into tears youre hurt werner said should we go to the hospital she shook her head vigorously its not that she said im just bruised ive had worse she slumped in a chair christ im tired who did this he asked angrily the usual people she said they call themselves communists instead of nazis but theyre the same type its all over again werner put his arms around her she could not be consoled the bullies and the thugs have been in power for so long she sobbed will it ever end iv that night the soviet news agency put out an announcement from six oclock in the morning all passenger and freight transport in and out of west berlin trains cars and canal barges would be stopped no supplies of any kind would get through no food no milk no medicines no coal because the electricity generating stations would therefore be shut down they were switching off the supply of electricity to western sectors only the city was under siege lloyd williams was at british military headquarters there was a short parliamentary recess and ernie bevin had gone on holiday to sandbanks on the south coast of england but he was worried enough to send lloyd to berlin to observe the introduction of the new currency and keep him informed daisy had not accompanied lloyd their new baby davey was only six months old and anyway daisy and eva murray were organizing a birth control clinic for women in hoxton that was about to open its doors lloyd was desperately afraid that this crisis would lead to war he had fought in two wars and he never wanted to see a third he had two small children who he hoped would grow up in a peaceful world he was married to the prettiest sexiest most lovable woman on the planet and he wanted to spend many long decades with her general clay the workaholic american military governor ordered his staff to plan an armoured convoy that would barrel down the autobahn from helmstedt in the west straight through soviet territory to berlin sweeping all before it lloyd heard about this plan at the same time as the british governor sir brian robertson and heard him say in his clipped soldierly tones if clay does that it will be war but nothing else made any sense the americans came up with other suggestions lloyd heard talking to clays younger aides the secretary of the army kenneth royall wanted to halt the currency reform clay told him it had gone too far to be reversed next royall proposed evacuating all americans clay told him that was exactly what the soviets wanted sir brian wanted to supply the city by air most people thought that was impossible someone calculated that berlin required tons of fuel and food per day were there enough airplanes in the world to move that much stuff no one knew nevertheless sir brian ordered the royal air force to make a start on friday afternoon sir brian went to see clay and lloyd was invited to be part of the entourage sir brian said to clay the russians might block the autobahn ahead of your convoy and wait and see if you have the nerve to attack them but i dont think theyll shoot planes down i dont see how we can deliver enough supplies by air clay said again nor do i said sir brian but were going to do it until we think of something better clay picked up the phone get me general lemay in wiesbaden he said after a minute he said curtis have you got any planes there that can carry coal there was a pause coal said clay more loudly another pause yes that is what i said coal a moment later clay looked up at sir brian he says the us air force can deliver anything the british returned to their headquarters on saturday lloyd got an army driver and went into the soviet zone on a personal mission he drove to the address at which he had visited the von ulrich family fifteen years ago he knew that maud was still living there his mother and maud had resumed correspondence at the end of the war mauds letters put a brave face on what was undoubtedly severe hardship she did not ask for help and anyway there was nothing ethel could do for her rationing was still in force in britain the place looked very different in it had been a fine town house a little run down but still gracious now it looked like a dump most of the windows had boards or paper instead of glass there were bullet holes in the stonework and the garden wall had collapsed the woodwork had not been painted for many years lloyd sat in the car for a few moments looking at the house last time he came here he had been eighteen and hitler had only just become chancellor of germany the young lloyd had not dreamed of the horrors the world was going to see neither he nor anyone else had suspected how close fascism would come to triumphing over all europe and how much they would have to sacrifice to defeat it he felt a bit like the von ulrich house looked battered and bombed and shot at but still standing he walked up the path and knocked he recognized the maid who opened the door hello ada do you remember me he said in german im lloyd williams the house was better inside than out ada showed him up to the drawing room where there were flowers in a glass tumbler on the piano a brightly patterned blanket had been thrown over the sofa no doubt to hide holes in the upholstery the newspapers in the windows let in a surprising amount of light a twoyearold boy walked into the room and inspected him with frank curiosity he was dressed in clothes that were evidently homemade and he had an oriental look who are you he said my name is lloyd who are you walli he said he ran out again and lloyd heard him say to someone outside that man talks funny so much for my german accent lloyd thought then he heard the voice of a middleaged woman dont make such remarks its impolite sorry grandma next moment maud walked in her appearance shocked lloyd she was in her midfifties but looked seventy her hair was grey her face was gaunt and her blue silk dress was threadbare she kissed his cheek with shrunken lips lloyd williams what a joy to see you shes my aunt lloyd thought with a rather queer feeling but she did not know that ethel had kept the secret maud was followed by carla who was unrecognizable and her husband lloyd had met carla as a precocious elevenyearold now he calculated she was twentysix although she looked halfstarved most germans did she was pretty and had a confident air that surprised lloyd something about the way she stood made him think she might be pregnant he knew from mauds letters that carla had married werner who had been a handsome charmer back in and was still the same they spent an hour catching up the family had been through unimaginable horror and said so frankly yet lloyd still had a sense that they were editing out the worst details he told them about daisy evie and dave during the conversation a teenage girl came in and asked carla if she could go to her friends house this is our daughter rebecca carla said to lloyd she was about sixteen so lloyd supposed she must be adopted have you done your homework carla asked the girl ill do it tomorrow morning do it now please carla said firmly oh mother no argument said carla she turned back to lloyd and rebecca stomped out they talked about the crisis carla was deeply involved as a city councillor she was pessimistic about the future of berlin she thought the russians would simply starve the population until the west gave in and handed the city over to total soviet control let me show you something that may make you feel differently lloyd said will you come with me in the car maud stayed behind with walli but carla and werner went with lloyd he told the driver to take them to tempelhof the airport in the american zone when they arrived he led them to a high window from which they could look down on the runway there on the tarmac were a dozen c skytrain aircraft lined up nose to tail some with the american star some with the raf roundel their cargo doors were open and a truck stood at each one german porters and american airmen were unloading the aircraft there were sacks of flour big drums of kerosene cartons of medical supplies and wooden crates containing thousands of bottles of milk while they watched empty aircraft were taking off and more were coming in to land this is amazing said carla her eyes glistening ive never seen anything like it there has never been anything like it lloyd replied she said but can the british and americans keep it up i think we have to but for how long as long as it takes said lloyd firmly and they did almost halfway through the twentieth century on august volodya peshkov was on the ustyurt plateau east of the caspian sea in kazakhstan it was a stony desert in the deep south of the ussr where nomads herded goats in much the same way as they had in bible times volodya was in a military truck that bounced uncomfortably along a rough track dawn was breaking over a landscape of rock sand and low thorny bushes a bony camel alone beside the road stared malevolently at the truck as it passed in the dim distance volodya saw the bomb tower lit by a battery of spotlights zoya and the other scientists had built their first nuclear bomb according to the design volodya had got from willi frunze in santa fe it was a plutonium device with an implosion trigger there were other designs but this one had worked twice before once in new mexico and once at nagasaki so it should work today the test was codenamed rds but they called it first lightning volodyas truck pulled up at the foot of the tower looking up he saw a clutch of scientists on the platform doing something with a snakes nest of cables that led to detonators on the skin of the bomb a figure in blue overalls stepped back and there was a toss of blonde hair zoya volodya felt a flush of pride my wife he thought top physicist and mother of two she conferred with two men the three heads close together arguing volodya hoped nothing was wrong this was the bomb that would save stalin everything else had gone wrong for the soviet union western europe had turned decisively democratic scared off communism by bullyboy kremlin tactics and bought off by marshall plan bribes the ussr had not even been able to take control of berlin when the airlift had gone on relentlessly day after day for almost a year the soviet union had given up and reopened the roads and railways in eastern europe stalin had retained control only by brute force truman had been reelected president and considered himself leader of the world the americans had stockpiled nuclear weapons and had stationed b bombers in britain ready to turn the soviet union into a radioactive wasteland but everything would change today if the bomb exploded as it should the ussr and the usa would be equals again when the soviet union could threaten america with nuclear devastation american domination of the world would be over volodya no longer knew whether that would be good or bad if it did not explode both zoya and volodya would probably be purged sent to labour camps in siberia or just shot volodya had already talked to his parents and they had promised to take care of kotya and galina as they would if volodya and zoya were killed by the test in the strengthening light volodya saw at various distances around the tower an odd variety of buildings houses of brick and wood a bridge over nothing and the entrance to some kind of underground structure presumably the army wanted to measure the effect of the blast looking more carefully he saw trucks tanks and obsolete aircraft placed for the same purpose he imagined the scientists were also going to assess the impact of the bomb on living creatures there were horses cattle sheep and dogs in kennels the confab on the platform ended with a decision the three scientists nodded and resumed their work a few minutes later zoya came down and greeted her husband is everything all right he said we think so zoya replied you think so she shrugged weve never done this before obviously they got into the truck and drove across country that was already a wasteland to the distant control bunker the other scientists were close behind at the bunker they all put on welders goggles as the countdown ticked away at sixty seconds zoya held volodyas hand at ten seconds he smiled at her and said i love you at one second he held his breath then it was as if the sun had suddenly risen a light stronger than noon flooded the desert in the direction of the bomb tower a ball of fire grew impossibly high reaching for the moon volodya was startled by the lurid colours in the fireball green purple orange and violet the ball turned into a mushroom whose umbrella kept rising at last the sound arrived a bang as if the largest artillery piece in the red army had been fired a foot away followed by rolling thunder that reminded volodya of the terrible bombardment of the seelow heights at last the cloud began to disperse and the noise faded there was a long moment of stunned silence someone said my god i didnt expect that volodya embraced his wife you did it he said she looked solemn i know she said but what did we do you saved communism said volodya ii the russian bomb was based on fat man the one we dropped on nagasaki said special agent bill bicks someone gave them the plans how do you know greg asked him from a defector they were sitting in bickss carpeted office in the washington headquarters of the fbi at nine oclock in the morning bicks had his jacket off his shirt was stained in the armpits with sweat though the building was comfortably airconditioned according to this guy bicks went on a red army intelligence colonel got the plans from one of the scientists on the manhattan project team did he say who he doesnt know which scientist thats why i called you in we need to find the traitor the fbi checked them all out at the time and most of them were security risks there was nothing we could do but you knew them personally who was the red army colonel i was coming to that you know him his name is vladimir peshkov my halfbrother yes if i were you id suspect me greg said it with a laugh but he was very uneasy oh we did believe me bicks said youve been subjected to the most thorough investigation i have seen in twenty years with the bureau greg gave him a sceptical look no kidding your kids doing well in school isnt he greg was shocked who could have told the fbi about georgy you mean my godson he said greg i said thorough we know hes your son greg was annoyed but he suppressed the feeling he had probed the personal secrets of numerous suspects during his time in army security he had no right to object youre clean bicks went on im relieved to hear it anyway our defector insisted the plans came from a scientist rather than any of the normal army personnel working on the project greg said thoughtfully when i met volodya in moscow he told me he had never been to the united states he lied said bicks he came here in september he spent a week in new york then we lost him for eight days he resurfaced briefly then went home eight days yeah were embarrassed its enough time to go to santa fe stay a couple of days and come back right bicks leaned forward across his desk but think if the scientist had already been recruited as a spy why wasnt he contacted by his regular controller why bring someone from moscow to talk to him you think the traitor was recruited on this twoday visit it seems too quick possibly he had worked for them before but lapsed either way were guessing the soviets needed to send someone whom the scientist already knew that means there ought to be a connection between volodya and one of the scientists bicks gestured at a side table covered with tan file folders the answer is in there somewhere those are our files on every one of the scientists who had access to those plans what do you want me to do go through them isnt that your job weve already done it we didnt find anything were hoping youll spot something weve missed ill sit here and keep you company do some paperwork its a long job youve got all day greg frowned did they know bicks said confidently you have no plans for the rest of the day greg shrugged got any coffee he had coffee and doughnuts then more coffee then a sandwich at lunchtime then a banana midafternoon he read every known detail about the lives of the scientists their wives and families childhood education career love and marriage achievements and eccentricities and sins he was eating the last bite of banana when he said jesus fucking christ what said bicks willi frunze went to the berlin boys academy greg slapped the file triumphantly down on the desk and so did volodya he told me bicks thumped his desk in excitement school friends thats it weve got the bastard its not proof said greg oh dont worry hell confess how can you be sure those scientists believe that knowledge should be shared with everyone not kept secret hell try to justify himself by arguing that he did it for the good of humanity maybe he did hell go to the electric chair all the same said bicks greg was suddenly chilled willi frunze had seemed a nice guy will he you bet your ass hes going to fry bicks was right willi frunze was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death and he died in the electric chair so did his wife iii daisy watched her husband tie his white bow tie and slip into the tailcoat of his perfectly fitting dress suit you look like a million dollars she said and she meant it he should have been a movie star she remembered him thirteen years earlier wearing borrowed clothes at the trinity ball and she felt a pleasant frisson of nostalgia he had looked pretty good then she recalled even though his suit was two sizes too big they were staying in her fathers permanent suite at the ritzcarlton hotel in washington lloyd was now a junior minister in the british foreign office and he had come here on a diplomatic visit lloyds parents ethel and bernie were thrilled to be looking after two grandchildren for a week tonight daisy and lloyd were going to a ball at the white house she was wearing a dropdead dress by christian dior pink satin with a dramatically spreading skirt made of endless folds of flaring tulle after the years of wartime austerity she was delighted to be able to buy gowns in paris again she thought of the yacht club ball of in buffalo the event that she imagined at the time had ruined her life the white house was obviously a lot more prestigious but she knew that nothing that happened tonight could ruin her life she reflected on that while lloyd helped her put on her mothers necklace of rosecoloured diamonds with matching earrings at the age of nineteen she had desperately wanted highstatus people to accept her now she could hardly imagine worrying about such a thing as long as lloyd said she looked fabulous she did not care what anyone else thought the only other person whose approval she might seek was her motherinlaw eth leckwith who had little social status and had certainly never worn a paris gown did every woman look back and think how foolish she had been when young daisy thought again about ethel who had certainly behaved foolishly getting pregnant by her married employer but never spoke regretfully about it maybe that was the right attitude daisy contemplated her own mistakes becoming engaged to charlie farquharson rejecting lloyd marrying boy fitzherbert she was not quite able to look back and think about the good that had come of those choices it was really not until she had been decisively rejected by high society and had found consolation at ethels kitchen in aldgate that her life had taken a turn for the better she had stopped yearning for social status and had learned what real friendship was and she had been happy ever since now that she no longer cared she enjoyed parties even more ready said lloyd she was ready she put on the matching evening coat that dior had made to go with the dress they went down in the elevator left the hotel and stepped into the waiting limousine iv carla persuaded her mother to play the piano on christmas eve maud had not played for years perhaps it saddened her by bringing back memories of walter they had always played and sung together and she had often told the children how she had tried and failed to teach him to play ragtime but she no longer told that story and carla suspected that nowadays the piano made maud think of joachim koch the young officer who had come to her for piano lessons whom she had deceived and seduced and whom carla and ada had killed in the kitchen carla herself was not able to shut out the recollection of that nightmare evening especially getting rid of the body she did not regret it they had done the right thing but all the same she would have preferred to forget it however maud at last agreed to play silent night for them all to sing along werner ada erik and the three children rebecca walli and the new baby lili gathered around the old steinway in the drawing room carla put a candle on the piano and studied the faces of her family in its moving shadows as they sang the familiar german carol walli in werners arms would be four years old in a few weeks time and he tried to sing along alertly guessing the words and the melody he had the oriental eyes of his rapist father carla had decided that her revenge would be to raise a son who treated women with tenderness and respect erik sang the words of the hymn sincerely he supported the soviet regime as blindly as he had supported the nazis carla had at first been baffled and infuriated but now she saw a sad logic to it erik was one of those inadequate people who were so scared by life that they preferred to live under harsh authority to be told what to do and what to think by a government that allowed no dissent they were foolish and dangerous but there were an awful lot of them carla gazed fondly at her husband still handsome at thirty she recalled kissing him and more in the front of his sexy car parked in the grunewald when she was nineteen she still liked kissing him when she thought over the time that had passed since then she had a thousand regrets but the biggest was her fathers death she missed him constantly and still cried when she remembered him lying in the hall beaten so cruelly that he did not live until the doctor arrived but everyone had to die and father had given his life for the sake of a better world if more germans had had his courage the nazis would not have triumphed she wanted to do all the things he had done to raise her children well to make a difference to her countrys politics to love and be loved most of all when she died she wanted her children to be able to say as she said of her father that her life had meant something and that the world was a better place for it the carol came to an end maud held the final chord and little walli leaned forward and blew the candle out acknowledgements my principal history advisor for the century trilogy is richard overy i am grateful also to historians evan mawdsley tim rees matthias reiss and richard toye for
