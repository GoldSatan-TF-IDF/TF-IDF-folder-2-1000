ross macdonald rex stout dorothy salisbury davis ellery queen bill pronzini edward d hoch linda barnes sue grafton tony hillerman marcia muller rosemary herbert the oxford book of american detective stories first published in introduction twentyfive years ago when i was a first novelist on a visit to my editor i had the occasion to read the galley proofs of a catalog of crime now a bible of the detectivefiction genre my editor who was also editing the catalog was called away to deal with another problem the author of the catalog was due to pick up his proofs i was told why didnt i take a look to see if my book had made it into the volume i found it on page the author had recommended less routine plots and said that unbelievable feats of survival and retaliation by people badly wounded and haemorrhaging make the reader impatient i checked the title page to find the author of this affront jacques barzun i knew the name a giant of the humanities former dean and provost of columbia university and author of house of the intellect and other weighty books until then i had no idea that he was also an eminent critic of detective fiction in fact i knew almost nothing about the field my ignorance was quickly dented barzun arrived to collect his galleys and sensed from my sullen expression that he hadnt approved my work in the ensuing conversation i first learned that the game i had been playing had rules many of which i had violated the point of the anecdote is the purpose of this anthology while the detective story is founded on rules that remain important today the distinctly american take on these rules has vastly enriched the genre when rosemary herbert and i determined to select stories that would trace the evolution of the american detective short story we discovered that i was far from the first american author to break or bend the rules my american predecessors had been early pioneers in playing the detective game on their own terms but nobody can deny that assumptions traditions and rules of the genre remain important just what are they early detective fiction was categorised as a tale rather than as serious fiction as barzun tells us edgar allan foe is not only the founding father and the complete authority on the form but also the one who first made the point that the regular novel and the legitimate mystery will not combine why not because in the tradition originated by the genius of poe the detective story emerged as a competition between writer and reader it was a game intended to challenge the intellect although poe himself in the murders in the rue morgue did arouse awe and horror the major preoccupationand innovationin this story is the introduction of the puzzle the reader is challenged to attempt to solve it with the clues provided in the final pages the reader will learn if his or her solution matches that of the detective given such a purpose the reader and writer had to be playing by the same rules even though the rules are rather selfevident they were formalised by monsignor ronald knox in his introduction to the best detective stories of his rendition of the rules came to be known as the detective decalogue perhaps because father knox was known as a theologian and translator of the bible as well as a crime writer the rules were also referred to as the ten commandments of detective writing the rules are technical the writer must introduce the criminal early produce all clues found for immediate inspection by the reader use no more than one secret room or passageway and eschew acts of god unknown poisons unaccountable intuitions helpful accidents and so forth identical twins and doubles are prohibited unless the reader is prepared for them and having the detective himself commit the crime is specifically barred some rules are whimsical at best or sadly indicative of the prejudices of knoxs day rule v for example provides that no chinaman must figure in the story in all the rules confirm the fact that detective stories are a game it is worth noting that all but one of those best detective stories in the anthology were written by british authors it was the golden age of the classic form and though the american poe was considered the inventor of the form england was where the traditional side of the genre flourished sir arthur conan doyle with sherlock holmes as his detective and dr john h watson as his narrator straight man had earlier brought the detective short story to its finest flowering and agatha christie polished the puzzle form particularly in her novels to perfection but this volume shows that even then things were changing in america as our selections show american writers had been injecting new elements into and otherwise tinkering with poes classic form since the nineteenth century then came the era of disillusion which followed world war i the cultural revolt of the roaring twenties the rise of organized crime and of political and police corruption which accompanied national prohibition and the ensuing great depression all contributed to changing the nature of american literaturewith detective fiction leading the way in its recording of a distinctive american voice and its depiction of the social scene in fact i believe that raymond chandler was a greater influence on later generations of american writersin and out of the detective genrethan was that darling of the literary establishment f scott fitzgerald barzun told us that the classic detective story is written by and for the educated uppermiddle classes particularly in the british manifestation it was typically set in uppercrust milieus but weve chosen susan glaspell to demonstrate that in an american writers hands the story can also succeed in a remote rural farmhouse literally in the middle of america glaspells story a jury of her peers also proves that social concerns like wife battering can be used to evoke an emotional reaction on the part of the reader even while the puzzle element remains central while in britain readers were puzzling over whodunit in stories sold at railway stations in the united states the newspaper stands and drugstore magazine racks held detective fiction of a different sortpublished in pulp magazines with garish covers and cheap prices one of these was black mask and one who wrote for it was a former pinkerton private detective named dashiell hammett like many of his fellow american producers of detective fiction hammett was definitely not an effete product of the upper or even solidly middle class neither were the settings of his stories nor the characters who populated them he and other american crime writers during the depression years were taking crime out of the drawing rooms of country houses and putting it back on the mean streets where it was actually happening this is not to say that the classic form was dead or even ailing early examples in this volume are the work of bret harte and jacques futrelle harte known for his depictions of american life in gold rush territory could turn his hand to writing the quintessential sherlockian pastiche the stolen cigar case and jacques futrelles the problem of cell obeys all the rules of the lockedroom mystery with a character locked into a highsecurity death cell in an american prison meanwhile on the novel scene until the end of the s the bestselling american author of detective fiction was s s van dine whose supersleuth philo vance is among the most thoroughgoing snobs ever to appear in fiction van dines intricate plots follow the rules of knoxs decalogue and are played out in aristocratic settings into which the reality of corrupt cops soup lines and american hard times never intrudes the purpose is the puzzle even today literally millions of american readers buy detective fiction principally for the classical game in one way or another the puzzle remains essential to the form as demonstrated in the variety of mutations the detective story has been generating through the twentieth century to consider the variations one must start at the base with the murders in the rue morgue in this story poe gives us the model for the classic detective tale which is still alive and thriving in various modifications chevalier auguste dupin his sleuth not only is in my opinion the first detective of detective fiction but is white male of an excellentindeed illustrious family financially independent and an amateur the police are inept the crime was the model for thousands of lockedroom murders done in a setting from which it seems impossible for the killer to escape and the solution is based on close observation of physical evidence to which the superior ratiocination of dupin is applied and true to poes disdain for the notion of democracy and the uncouth labouring class the principal characters except the killer are wellbred folks in the purloined letter poe produced an even purer model moving crime into the marble halls of the aristocracy a century later with the traditional form enjoying its golden age many writers still followed poes pattern lockedroom crimes continued to flourish the murder was done in a world of manor houses formal gardens faithful butlers haughty house guests and stupid police the blood on the persian carpet was usually blue and everything was divorced from reality into this quiet haven the skilful writer allowed no realism to intrude it would distract the reader from the intricate puzzle the writer was unfolding properly done such stories are perfect escape literature book dealers labelled them cozies and julian symons british crime writer and longtime literary critic for the times of london called them humdrums fans bought them by the millions and still do in his introduction to a catalog of crime barzun explained what the detective story should give those readers and what it should avoid first he stressed that the detective story is a tale not a novel the tale does not pretend to social significance nor does it probe the depth of the soul he wrote the characters it presents are not persons but types as in the gospels the servant the rich man the camel driver now a chauffeur properly done detective fiction is a highbrow form according to barzun it is escape literature for the intellectual it should deal with the workings of human reason not with human emotion to put our creed positively said barzun speaking for coauthor wendell hertig taylor as well we hold with the best philosophers that a detective story should be mainly occupied with detection and not say with the forgivable nervousness of a man planning to murder his wife that great essay was published in but three years earlier raymond chandlers the simple art of murder had been republished including the famous introductory essay which served as a sort of writers declaration of independence from the strictures of the classic form i suspect that barzuns essay was intended at least in part as a counterattack against the case that chandler made for the detective story as novel and for the myriad modifications the genre had been undergoing particularly in america fortunately for me and for hundreds of other mystery writers attracted into the genre for the other creative possibilities it offers an increasing number of readers came to care less about whodunit and more about character development social problems settings mood culture and all those aspects that involve emotion and not just the intellect with the socalled mainstream of american literature polluted by the notions of the minimalists and literary criticism entangled in the various fads of the midcentury writers who thought they had something to say or a story to tell discovered detective fiction as hammett and chandler had been writing it the mainstream novel lying moribund under midcentury faddism was being crowded off the bestseller lists by crime novels and mysteries many of detective fictions new practitioners leaped into the game as did i happily ignorant of knoxs ten commandments or the genres purpose as escapism for the intellectual instead of turning on whodunit the focus shifted elsewhere sometimes as in ed mcbains story small homicide the writers were chiefly interested in why the crime had been committed or perhaps they merely used the sleuthing to draw the reader into a world they wanted to explore as the stories in this volume illustrate americans who wrote in the detective form had been branching out in all directions the tale had been moved out of the isolation of the privileged class and into workaday america and was often drawn with an excellent eye for regional settings and a keen ear for local voices a bit of social purpose and realism had seeped in in the united states the sleuthing game had never been the exclusive domain of wellbred male amateurs more and more of the popular writersand their sleuthswere women an early female detective found in these pages is violet strange in anna katharine greens missing page thirteen but until the work of hammett in the s and raymond chandler in the s began to have its effect the puzzle generally remained at the heart of the work certainly in the minds of the publishing fraternity that was what the public wanted but even chandler encountered editing that sought to trim his appeal to readers emotions in a letter to a friend written in chandler noted that when he was writing short stories for the pulpmagazine market editors cut out the language he used to establish mood and emotion on the grounds that their readers wanted action not description my theory was that the readers just thought they cared about nothing but the action that really although they didnt know it the thing they cared about was the creation of emotion through dialogue and description as our selection ill be waiting shows chandler was not interested in producing the classic form as outlined by knoxs rules he was interested in using crime as the centre around which he could spin a novel that illuminates social decadence and the human condition in this volume rosemary herbert and i have assembled thirtythree stories that represent the evolution of the american detective story because the wealth of talent over the past century and a half was so great we found ourselves in a position reminiscent of that of professional football coaches facing the deadline for cutting their teams down to the legal limit with too many outstanding players to chose among just as coaches sometimes keep a player because he can serve in more than one position we chose our stories to illustrate more than one development in the field rex stouts christmas party for example shows nero wolfe unusually active for an armchair detectivebut it beautifully illuminates how the holmes and watson relationship had been modified in making another selection we evaluated several journalist sleuths including george harmon coxes photojournalist flashgun casey but we picked joe daffy dill for this volume because we found richard sales story a nose for news irresistibly entertaining our goal was to illustrate as many aspects of the american detective short story as we could thus we present examples of sleuth types including amateurs like poes dupin scientific sleuths like futrelles professor s f x van dusen and arthur b reeves professor craig kennedy hardboiled dicks like robert leslie bellems dan turner and police characters like ed mcbains eightyseventh precinct cop dave levine and my own jim chee and joe leaphorn we also feature accidental sleuthscharacters who happen upon a crime and manage to discover the truthas do the characters in glaspells a jury of her peers and mary roberts rineharts the lipstick and mignon g eberharts susan dare sue graftons kinsey millhone and linda barness carlotta carlyle join greens violet strange as female private investigators melville davisson posts uncle abner and william faulkners uncle gavin stevens are sermonising sleuths who grind moral axes until they shine while clayton rawsons the great merlini adds sparkle to his sleuthing by means of his practical expertise in magic stories that succeed in presenting examples of sleuth types also demonstrate regionalism for which american detective fiction has become known the works of glaspell post bellem and faulkner portray distinctly american scenes as does my own short story chees witch which illustrates the move into the use of ethnic detectives although our table of contents includes the names of a good number of famous authors we were more concerned to find the best story to represent a trend in the genre some of our selections are classics some represent littleknown writers whom we consider good finds for readers for example we considered clinton h staggs the keyboard of silence delightful and included it as a gem that deserves to be better known and not only because staggs blind sleuth demonstrates how disabled detectives can function efficiently while we represent as many decades as possible and male and female sleuths and authors we also chose our selections to show emotional range we cover humour with harte and barnes pathos with glaspell and mcbain and we are sure that readers will have fun with reeves the beauty mask in which the scientific jiggerypokery is so dated that readers will find themselves chuckling even while being taken in by the earnestness with which it was written i join with rosemary herbert in the belief that we have fairly represented the evolution of the detective story in america but our mission was to entertain as well as to educate we trust that you will find this volume just plain fun to read tony hillerman with rosemary herbert edgar allan poe although his life was short and tragic edgar allan poe is considered by a few to be the founder of american letters by many to be the inventor of horror stories and fantasy novels and by one and all to be the father of detective fiction he was the child of two actors orphaned as a tot expelled from west point and rejected by his fiancée he married his cousin and after she died of tuberculosis wed the original fiancée through much of his forty years his health was poor despiteor perhaps inspired byhis circumstances poe became a published poet at age twenty and he served as editor of the southern literary messenger until he was fired at age twentyeight for drunkenness by the time poe wrote the murders in the rue morgue when he was thirtytwo he was already well established with his literary criticism magazine articles short stories and poetry the murders in the rue morgue is considered to be the single most important piece in the literary history of detective fiction while some elements that are now common to the genre like the lockedroom scenario had been used previous to the publication of poes masterpiece poe was the first to play with what were to become conventions of the genre these include the introduction of an eccentric detective who relies on ratiocination to solve crimes and the use of a narrator who while awestruck at the sleuths powers nonetheless lays out a clearly described problem and details the steps toward its solution the purpose of literature poe said is to amuse by arousing thought he also said that tales of ratiocination should stick to the puzzle and not wander off into novelistic digressions of mood and character thus he not only invented the detective form but also provided its credo despite its atmosphere of horror the murders in the rue morgue shows poe practicing what he preached the focus remains on the puzzle and the process of solving it his sleuth chevalier auguste dupin is a private person a thinking machine with his ratiocination narrated by a faceless friend the police are depicted as inept and looked on with disdain clues are presented fairly and the reader is invited to interpret them readers of this anthology will notice that the form poe created in the s has been followed with modifications throughout the literary history of the genre variations on the form continue to challenge writers and excite readers today the murders in the rue morgue what song the syrens sang or what name achilles assumed when he hid himself among women although puzzling questions are not beyond all conjecture sir thomas browne the mental features discoursed of as the analytical are in themselves but little susceptible of analysis we appreciate them only in their effects we know of them among other things that they are always to their possessor when inordinately possessed a source of the liveliest enjoyment as the strong man exults in his physical ability delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles he derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play he is fond of enigmas of conundrums of hieroglyphics exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension preternatural his results brought about by the very soul and essence of method have in truth the whole air of intuition the faculty of resolution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study and especially by that highest branch of it which unjustly and merely on account of its retrograde operations has been called as if par excellence analysis yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse a chessplayer for example does the one without effort at the other it follows that the game of chess in its effects upon mental character is greatly misunderstood i am not now writing a treatise but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random i will therefore take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess in this latter where the pieces have different and bizarre motions with various and variable values what is only complex is mistaken a not unusual error for what is profound the attention is here called powerfully into play if it flag for an instant an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat the possible moves being not only manifold but involute the chances of such oversights are multiplied and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers in draughts on the contrary where the moves are unique and have but little variation the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen to be less abstractlet us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings and where of course no oversight is to be expected it is obvious that here the victory can be decided the players being at all equal only by some recherché movement the result of some strong exertion of the intellect deprived of ordinary resources the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent identifies himself therewith and not unfrequently sees thus at a glance the sole methods sometimes indeed absurdly simple ores by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it while eschewing chess as frivolous beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis the best chessplayer in christendom may be little more than the best player of chess but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind when i say proficiency i mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived these are not only manifold but multiform and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding to observe attentively is to remember distinctly and so far the concentrative chessplayer will do very well at whist while the rules of hoyle themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game are sufficiently and generally comprehensible thus to have a retentive memory and to proceed by the book are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing but it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced he makes in silence a host of observations and inferences so perhaps do his companions and the difference in the extent of the information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation the necessary knowledge is that of what to observe our player confines himself not at all nor because the game is the object does he reject deductions from things external to the game he examines the countenance of his partner comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents he considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand often counting trump by trump and honor by honour through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each he notes every variation of face as the play progresses gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty of surprise of triumph or of chagrin from the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit he recognises what is played through feint by the air with which it is thrown upon the table a casual or inadvertent word the accidental dropping or turning of a card with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment the counting of the tricks with the order of their arrangement embarrassment hesitation eagerness or trepidationall afford to his apparently intuitive perception indications of the true state of affairs the first two or three rounds having been played he is in full possession of the contents of each hand and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own the analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis the constructive or combining power by which ingenuity is usually manifested and to which the phrenologists i believe erroneously have assigned a separate organ supposing it a primitive faculty has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater indeed than that between the fancy and the imagination but of a character very strictly analogous it will be found in fact that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly imaginative never otherwise then analytic the narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced residing in paris during the spring and part of the summer of i there became acquainted with a monsieur c auguste dupin this young gentleman was of an excellentindeed of an illustrious family but by a variety of untoward events had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it and he ceased to bestir himself in the world or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes by courtesy of his creditors there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony and upon the income arising from this he managed by means of a rigorous economy to procure the necessaries of life without troubling himself about its superfluities books indeed were his sole luxuries and in paris these are easily obtained our first meeting was at an obscure library in the rue montmartre where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume brought us into closer communion we saw each other again and again i was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candour which a frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme i was astonished too at the vast extent of his reading and above all i felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervour and the vivid freshness of his imagination seeking in paris the objects i then sought i felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price and this feeling i frankly confided to him it was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own i was permitted to be at the expense of renting and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper a timeeaten and grotesque mansion long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the faubourg st germain had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world we should have been regarded as madmenalthough perhaps as madmen of a harmless nature our seclusion was perfect we admitted no visitors indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates and it had been many years since dupin had ceased to know or be known in paris we existed within ourselves alone it was a freak of fancy in my friend for what else shall i call it to be enamoured of the night for her own sake and into this bizarrerie as into all his others i quietly fell giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon the sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always but we could counterfeit her presence at the first dawn of the morning we closed all the massy shutters of our old building lighting a couple of tapers which strongly perfumed threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays by the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreamsreading writing or conversing until warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm continuing the topics of the day or roaming far and wide until a late hour seeking amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford at such times i could not help remarking and admiring although from his rich ideality i had been prepared to expect it a peculiar analytic ability in dupin he seemed too to take an eager delight in its exerciseif not exactly in its displayand did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived he boasted to me with a low chuckling laugh that most men in respect to himself wore windows in their bosoms and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own his manner at these moments was frigid and abstract his eyes were vacant in expression while his voice usually a rich tenor rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation observing him in these moods i often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the bipart soul and amused myself with the fancy of a double dupinthe creative and the resolvent let it not be supposed from what i have just said that i am detailing any mystery or penning any romance what i have described in the frenchman was merely the result of an excited or perhaps of a diseased intelligence but of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea we were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of the palais royal being both apparently occupied with thought neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least all at once dupin broke forth with these words he is a very little fellow thats true and would do better for the théâtre des variétés there can be no doubt of that i replied unwittingly and not at first observing so much had i been absorbed in reflection the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations in an instant afterward i recollected myself and my astonishment was profound dupin said i gravely this is beyond my comprehension i do not hesitate to say that i am amazed and can scarcely credit my senses how was it possible you should know i was thinking of here i paused to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom i thought of chantilly said he why do you pause you were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy this was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the rue st denis who becoming stagemad had attempted the rôle of xerxes in crébillons tragedy so called and been notoriously pasquinaded for his pains tell me for heavens sake i exclaimed the methodif method there isby which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter in fact i was even more startled than i would have been willing to express it was the fruiterer replied my friend who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for xerxes el id genus omne the fruitereryou astonish mei know no fruiterer whomsoever the man who ran up against you as we entered the streetit may have been fifteen minutes ago i now remembered that in fact a fruiterer carrying upon his head a large basket of apples had nearly thrown me down by accident as we passed from the rue cinto the thoroughfare where we stood but what this had to do with chantilly i could not possibly understand there was not a particle of charlatanerie about dupin i will explain he said and that you may comprehend all clearly we will first retrace the course of your meditations from the moment in which i spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question the larger links of the chain run thus chantilly orion dr nichol epicurus stereotomy the street stones the fruiterer there are few persons who have not at some period of their lives amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained the occupation is often full of interest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the startingpoint and the goal what then must have been my amazement when i heard the frenchman speak what he had just spoken and when i could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth he continued we had been talking of horses if i remember aright just before leaving the rue c this was the last subject we discussed as we crossed into this street a fruiterer with a large basket upon his head brushing quickly past us thrust you upon a pile of pavingstones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair you stepped upon one of the loose fragments slipped slightly strained your ankle appeared vexed or sulky muttered a few words turned to look at the pile and then proceeded in silence i was not particularly attentive to what you did but observation has become with me of late a species of necessity you kept your eyes upon the groundglancing with a petulant expression at the holes and ruts in the pavement so that i saw you were still thinking of the stones until we reached the little alley called lamartine which has been paved by way of experiment with the overlapping and riveted blocks here your countenance brightened up and perceiving your lips move i could not doubt that you murmured the word stereotomy a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement i knew that you could not say to yourself stereotomy without being brought to think of atomies and thus of the theories of epicurus and since when we discussed this subject not very long ago i mentioned to you how singularly yet with how little notice the vague guesses of that noble greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony i felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in orion and i certainly expected that you would do so you did look up and i was now assured that i had correctly followed your steps but in that bitter tirade upon chantilly which appeared in yesterdays musée the satirist making some disgraceful allusions to the cobblers change of name upon assuming the buskin quoted a latin line about which we have often conversed i mean the line perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum i had told you that this was in reference to orion formerly written urion and from certain pungencies connected with this explanation i was aware that you could not have forgotten it it was clear therefore that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of orion and chantilly that you did combine them i saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips you thought of the poor cobblers immolation so far you had been stooping in your gait but now i saw you draw yourself up to your full height i was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of chantilly at this point i interrupted your meditations to remark that as in fact he was a very little fellowthat chantilly he would do better at the théâtre des variétés not long after this we were looking over an evening edition of the gazette des tribunaux when the following paragraphs arrested our attention extraordinary murdersthis morning about three oclock the inhabitants of the quartier st roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks issuing apparently from the fourth story of a house in the rue morgue known to be in the sole occupancy of one madame lespanaye and her daughter mademoiselle camille lespanaye after some delay occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner the gateway was broken in with a crowbar and eight or ten of the neighbours entered accompanied by two gendarmes by this time the cries had ceased but as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house as the second landing was reached these sounds also had ceased and everything remained perfectly quiet the party spread themselves and hurried from room to room upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story the door of which being found locked with the key inside was forced open a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment the apartment was in the wildest disorderthe furniture broken and thrown about in all directions there was only one bedstead and from this the bed had been removed and thrown into the middle of the floor on a chair lay a razor besmeared with blood on the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair also dabbled in blood and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots on the floor were found four napoleons an earring of topaz three large silver spoons three smaller of métal dalger and two bags containing nearly four thousand francs in gold the drawers of a bureau which stood in one corner were open and had been apparently rifled although many articles still remained in them a small iron safe was discovered under the bed not under the bedstead it was open with the key still in the door it had no contents beyond a few old letters and other papers of little consequence of madame lespanaye no traces were here seen but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fireplace a search was made in the chimney and horrible to relate the corpse of the daughter head downward was dragged therefrom it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance the body was quite warm upon examining it many excoriations were perceived no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged upon the face were many severe scratches and upon the throat dark bruises and deep indentations of finger nails as if the deceased had been throttled to death after a thorough investigation of every portion of the house without farther discovery the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building where lay the corpse of the old lady with her throat so entirely cut that upon an attempt to raise her the head fell off the body as well as the head was fearfully mutilatedthe former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity to this horrible mystery there is not as yet we believe the slightest clew the next days paper had these additional particulars the tragedy in the rue morgue many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair the word affairehas not yet in

and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found for more than six years it was formerly occupied by a jeweller who underlet the upper rooms to various persons the house was the property of madame l she became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant and moved into them herself refusing to let any portion the old lady was childish witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years the two lived an exceedingly retired lifewere reputed to have money had heard it said among the neighbours that madame l told fortunesdid not believe it had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter a porter once or twice and a physician some eight or ten times many other persons neighbours gave evidence to the same effect no one was spoken of as frequenting the house it was not known whether there were any living connexions of madame l and her daughter the shutters of the windows were seldom opened those in the rear were always closed with the exception of the large back room fourth story the house was a good housenot very old isidore muset gendarme deposes that he was called to the house about three oclock in the morning and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway endeavouring to gain admittance forced it open at length with a bayonetnot with a crowbar had but little difficulty in getting it open on account of its being a double or folding gate and bolted neither at bottom nor top the shrieks were continued until the gate was forcedand then suddenly ceased they seemed to be

contentionthe one a gruff voice the other much shrillera very strange voice could distinguish some words of the former which was that of a frenchman was positive that it was not a womans voice could distinguish the words sacréand diablethe shrill voice was that of a foreigner could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman could not make out what was said but believed the language to be spanish the state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday henri duval a neighbour and by trade a silversmith deposes that he was one of the party who first entered the house corroborates the testimony of muset in general as soon as they forced an entrance they reclosed the door to keep out the crowd which collected very fast notwithstanding the lateness of the hour the shrill voice this witness thinks was that of an italian was certain it was not french could not be sure that it was a mans voice it might have been a womans was not acquainted with the italian language could not distinguish the words but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an italian knew madame l and her daughter had conversed with both frequently was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased odenheimer restaurateur this witness volunteered his testimony not speaking french was examined through an interpreter is a native of amsterdam was passing the house at the time of the shrieks they lasted for several minutesprobably ten they were long and loudvery awful and distressing was one of those who entered the building corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one was sure that the shrill voice was that of a manof a frenchman could not distinguish the words uttered they were loud and quickunequalspoken apparently in fear as well as in anger the voice was harshnot so much shrill as harsh could not call it a shrill voice the gruff voice said repeatedly sacré diableand once mon dieu ules mignaud banker of the firm of mignaud et fils rue deloraine is the elder mignaud madame lespanaye had some property had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the yeareight years previously made frequent deposits in small sums had checked for nothing until the third day before her death when she took out in person the sum of francs this sum was paid in gold and a clerk sent home with the money adolphe le bon clerk to mignaud et fils deposes that on the day in question about noon he accompanied madame lespanaye to her residence with the francs put up in two bags upon the door being opened mademoiselle l appeared and took from his hands one of the bags while the old lady relieved him of the other he then bowed and departed did not see any person in the street at the time it is a byestreetvery lonely william bird tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered the house is an englishman has lived in paris two years was one of the first to ascend the stairs heard the voices in contention the gruff voice was that of a frenchman could make out several words but cannot now remember all heard distinctly sacréand mon dieuthere was a sound at the moment as if of several persons strugglinga scraping and scuffling sound the shrill voice was very loudlouder than the gruff one is sure that it was not the voice of an englishman appeared to be that of a german might have been a womans voice does not understand german four of the abovenamed witnesses being recalled deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of mademoiselle l was locked on the inside when the party reached it every thing was perfectly silentno groans or noises of any kind upon forcing the door no person was seen the windows both of the back and front room were down and firmly fastened from within a door between the two rooms was closed but not locked the door leading from the front room into the passage was locked with the key on the inside a small room in the front of the house on the fourth story at the head of the passage was open the door being ajar this room was crowded with old beds boxes and so forth these were carefully removed and searched there was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys the house was a four story one with garrets mansardes a trapdoor on the roof was nailed down very securelydid not appear to have been opened for years the time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door was variously stated by the witnesses some made it as short as three minutessome as long as five the door was opened with difficulty alfonzo garcia undertaker deposes that he resides in the rue morgue is a native of spain was one of the party who entered the house did not proceed up stairs is nervous and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation heard the voices in contention the gruff voice was that of a frenchman could not distinguish what was said the shrill voice was that of an englishmanis sure of this does not understand the english language but judges by the intonation alberto montani confectioner deposes that he was among the first to ascend the stairs heard the voices in question the gruff voice was that of a frenchman distinguished several words the speaker appeared to be expostulating could not make out the words of the shrill voice spoke quick and unevenly thinks it the voice of a russian corroborates the general testimony is an italian never conversed with a native of russia several witnesses recalled here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being by sweeps were meant cylindrical sweepingbrushes such as are employed by those who clean chimneys these brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house there is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs the body of mademoiselle lespanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength paul dumas physician deposes that he was called to view the bodies about daybreak they were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where mademoiselle l was found the corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated the fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances the throat was greatly chafed there were several deep scratches just below the chin together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers the face was fearfully discoloured and the eyeballs protruded the tongue had been partially bitten through a large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach produced apparently by the pressure of a knee in the opinion of m dumas mademoiselle lespanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown the corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated all the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered the left tibia much splintered as well as all the ribs of the left side whole body dreadfully bruised and discoloured it was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted a heavy club of wood or a broad bar of irona chairany large heavy and obtuse weapon would have produced such results if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man no woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon the head of the deceased when seen by witness was entirely separated from the body and was also greatly shattered the throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrumentprobably with a razor alexandre etienne surgeon was called with m dumas to view the bodies corroborated the testimony and the opinions of m dumas nothing farther of importance was elicited although several other persons were examined a murder so mysterious and so perplexing in all its particulars was never before committed in parisif indeed a murder has been committed at all the police are entirely at faultan unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature there is not however the shadow of a clew apparent the evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the quartier st rochthat the premises in question had been carefully researched and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted but all to no purpose a postscript however mentioned that adolphe le bon had been arrested and imprisonedalthough nothing appeared to incriminate him beyond the facts already detailed dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affairat least so i judged from his manner for he made no comments it was only after the announcement that le bon had been imprisoned that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders i could merely agree with all paris in considering them an insoluble mystery i saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer we must not judge of the means said dupin by this shell of an examination the parisian police so much extolled for acumen are cunning but no more there is no method in their proceedings beyond the method of the moment they make a vast parade of measures but not unfrequently these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed as to put us in mind of monsieur jourdains calling for his robedechambrepour mieux entendre la musique the results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising but for the most part are brought about by simple diligence and activity when these qualities are unavailing their schemes fail vidocq for example was a good guesser and a persevering man but without educated thought he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations he impaired his vision by holding the object too close he might see perhaps one or two points with unusual clearness but in so doing he necessarily lost sight of the matter as a whole thus there is such a thing as being too profound truth is not always in a well in fact as regards the more important knowledge i do believe that she is invariably superficial the depth lies in the valleys where we seek her and not upon the mountaintops where she is found the modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies to look at a star by glancesto view it in a sidelong way by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior is to behold the star distinctlyis to have the best appreciation of its lustrea lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it a greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case but in the former there is the more refined capacity for comprehension by undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought and it is possible to make even venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained too concentrated or too direct as for these murders let us enter into some examinations for ourselves before we make up an opinion respecting them an inquiry will afford us amusement i thought this an odd term so applied but said nothing and besides le bon once rendered me a service for which i am not ungrateful we will go and see the premises with our own eyes i know g the prefect of police and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission the permission was obtained and we proceeded at once to the rue morgue this is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the rue richelieu and the rue st roch it was late in the afternoon when we reached it as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided the house was readily found for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters with an objectless curiosity from the opposite side of the way it was an ordinary parisian house with a gateway on one side of which was a glazed watchbox with a sliding panel in the window indicating a loge de concierge before going in we walked up the street turned down an alley and then again turning passed in the rear of the buildingdupin meanwhile examining the whole neighbourhood as well as the house with a minuteness of attention for which i could see no possible object retracing our steps we came again to the front of the dwelling rang and having shown our credentials were admitted by the agents in charge we went up stairsinto the chamber where the body of mademoiselle lespanaye had been found and where both the deceased still lay the disorders of the room had as usual been suffered to exist i saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the gazette des tribunaux dupin scrutinised every thingnot excepting the bodies of the victims we then went into the other rooms and into the yard a gendarme accompanying us throughout the examination occupied us until dark when we took our departure on our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers i have said that the whims of my friend were manifold and that je les ménageaisfor this phrase there is no english equivalent it was his humour now to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder until about noon the next day he then asked me suddenly if i had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity there was something in his manner of emphasizing the word peculiar which caused me to shudder without knowing why no nothing peculiar i said nothing more at least than we both saw stated in the paper the gazette he replied has not entered i fear into the unusual horror of the thing but dismiss the idle opinions of this print it appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solutioni mean for the outré character of its features the police are confounded by the seeming absence of motivenot for the murder itselfbut for the atrocity of the murder they are puzzled too by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated mademoiselle lespanaye and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending the wild disorder of the room the corpse thrust with the head downward up the chimney the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady these considerations with those just mentioned and others which i need not mention have sufficed to paralyze the powers by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen of the government agents they have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse but it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary that reason feels its way if at all in its search for the true in investigations such as we are now pursuing it should not be so much asked what has occurred as what has occurred that has never occurred before in fact the facility with which i shall arrive or have arrived at the solution of this mystery is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police i stared at the speaker in mute astonishment i am now awaiting continued he looking toward the door of our apartmenti am now awaiting a person who although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration of the worst portion of the crimes committed it is probable that he is innocent i hope that i am right in this supposition for upon it i build my expectation of reading the entire riddle i look for the man herein this roomevery moment it is true that he may not arrive but the probability is that he will should he come it will be necessary to detain him here are pistols and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use i took the pistols scarcely knowing what i did or believing what i heard while dupin went on very much as if in a soliloquy i have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times his discourse was addressed to myself but his voice although by no means loud had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance his eyes vacant in expression regarded only the wall that the voices heard in contention he said by the party upon the stairs were not the voices of the women themselves was fully proved by the evidence this relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have committed suicide i speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method for the strength of madame lespanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughters corpse up the chimney as it was found and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of selfdestruction murder then has been committed by some third parry and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention let me now advertnot to the whole testimony respecting these voicesbut to what was peculiar in that testimony did you observe any thing peculiar about it i remarked that while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a frenchman there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill or as one individual termed it the harsh voice that was the evidence itself said dupin but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence you have observed nothing distinctive yet there was something to be observed the witnesses as you remark agreed about the gruff voice they were here unanimous but in regard to the shrill voice the peculiarity isnot that they disagreedbut that while an italian an englishman a spaniard a hollander and a frenchman attempted to describe it each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen each likens itnot to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversantbut the converse the frenchman supposes it the voice of a spaniard and might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the spanishthe dutchman maintains it to have been that of a frenchman but we find it stated that not understanding french this witness was examined through an interpreterthe englishman thinks it the voice of a german and does not understand germanthe spaniard is sure that it was that of an englishman but judges by the intonation altogether as he has no knowledge of the englishthe italian believes it the voice of a russian but has never conversed with a native of russiaa second frenchman differs moreover with the first and is positive that the voice was that of an italian but not being cognizant of that tongue is like the spaniard convinced by the intonation now how strangely unusual must that voice have really been about which such testimony as this could have been elicitedin whose tones even denizens of the five great divisions of europe could recognise nothing familiar you will say that it might have been the voice of an asiaticof an african neither asiatics nor africans abound in paris but without denying the inference i will now merely call your attention to three points the voice is termed by one witness harsh rather than shrill it is represented by two others to have been quick and unequalno wordsno sounds resembling wordswere by any witness mentioned as distinguishable i know not continued dupin what impression i may have made so far upon your own understanding but i do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimonythe portion respecting the gruff and shrill voicesare in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery i said legitimate deductions but my meaning is not thus fully expressed i designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result what the suspicion is however i will not say just yet i merely wish you to bear in mind that with myself it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite forma certain tendencyto my inquiries in the chamber let us now transport ourselves in fancy to this chamber what shall we first seek here the means of egress employed by the murderers it is not too much to say that neither of us believe in præternatural events madame and mademoiselle lespanaye were not destroyed by spirits the doers of the deed were material and escaped materially then how fortunately there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point and that mode must lead us to a definite decision let us examine each by each the possible means of egress it is clear that the assassins were in the room where mademoiselle lespanaye was found or at least in the room adjoining when the party ascended the stairs it is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues the police have laid bare the floors the ceilings and the masonry of the walls in every direction no secret issues could have escaped their vigilance but not trusting to their eyes i examined with my own there were then no secret issues both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked with the keys inside let us turn to the chimneys these although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths will not admit throughout their extent the body of a large cat the impossibility of egress by means already stated being thus absolute we are reduced to the windows through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street the murderers must have passed then through those of the back room now brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are it is not our part as reasoners to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities it is only left for us to prove that these apparent impossibilities are in reality not such there are two windows in the chamber one of them is unobstructed by furniture and is wholly visible the lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it the former was found securely fastened from within it resisted the utmost force of those who endeavoured to raise it a large gimlethole had been pierced in its frame to the left and a very stout nail was found fitted therein nearly to the head upon examining the other window a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash failed also the police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions and therefore it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows my own examination was somewhat more particular and was so for the reason i have just givenbecause here it was i knew that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality i proceeded to think thusá posteriori the murderers did escape from one of these windows this being so they could not have refastened the sashes from the inside as they were found fastenedthe consideration which put a stop through its obviousness to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter yet the sashes were fastened they must then have the power of fastening themselves there was no escape from this conclusion i stepped to the unobstructed casement withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash it resisted all my efforts as i had anticipated a concealed spring must i now knew exist and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises at least were correct however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails a careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring i pressed it and satisfied with the discovery forbore to upraise the sash i now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively a person passing out through this window might have reclosed it and the spring would have caughtbut the nail could not have been replaced the conclusion was plain and again narrowed in the field of my investigations the assassins must have escaped through the other window supposing then the springs upon each sash to be the same as was probable there must be found a difference between the nails or at least between the modes of their fixture getting upon the sacking of the bedstead i looked over the headboard minutely at the second casement passing my hand down behind the board i readily discovered and pressed the spring which was as i had supposed identical in character with its neighbour i now looked at the nail it was as stout as the other and apparently fitted in in the same mannerdriven in nearly up to the head you will say that i was puzzled but if you think so you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions to use a sporting phrase i had not been once at fault the scent had never for an instant been lost there was no flaw in any link of the chain i had traced the secret to its ultimate resultand that result was the nail it had i say in every respect the appearance of its fellow in the other window but this fact was an absolute nullity conclusive as it might seem to be when compared with the consideration that here at this point terminated the clew there must be something wrong i said about the nail i touched it and the head with about a quarter of an inch of the shank came off in my fingers the rest of the shank was in the gimlethole where it had been broken off the fracture was an old one for its edges were encrusted with rust and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer which had partially imbedded in the top of the bottom sash the head portion of the nail i now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence i had taken it and the resemblance to a perfect nail was completethe fissure was invisible pressing the spring i gently raised the sash for a few inches the head went up with it remaining firm in its bed i closed the window and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect the riddle so far was now unriddled the assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed dropping of its own accord upon his exit or perhaps purposely closed it had become fastened by the spring and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nailfarther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary the next question is that of the mode of descent upon this point i had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building about five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightningrod from this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself to say nothing of entering it i observed however that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by parisian carpenters ferradesa kind rarely employed at the present day but frequently seen upon very old mansions at lyons and bourdeaux they are in the form of an ordinary door a single not a folding door except that the upper half is latticed or worked in open trellisthus affording an excellent hold for the hands in the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad when we saw them from the rear of the house they were both about half openthat is to say they stood off at right angles from the wall it is probable that the police as well as myself examined the back of the tenement but if so in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth as they must have done they did not perceive this great breadth itself or at all events failed to take it into due consideration in fact having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination it was clear to me however that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed would if swung fully back to the wall reach to within two feet of the lightningrod it was also evident that by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage an entrance into the window from the rod might have been thus effectedby reaching to the distance of two feet and a half we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trelliswork letting go then his hold upon the rod placing his feet securely against the wall and springing boldly from it he might have swung the shutter so as to close it and if we imagine the window open at the time might even have swung himself into the room i wish you to bear especially in mind that i have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat it is my design to show you first that the thing might possibly have been accomplishedbut secondly and chiefly i wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinarythe almost præternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it you will say no doubt using the language of the law that to make out my case i should rather undervalue than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter this may be the practice in law but it is not the usage of reason my ultimate object is only the truth my immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxtaposition that very unusual activity of which i have just spoken with that very peculiar shrill or harsh and unequal voice about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected at these words a vague and halfformed conception of the meaning of dupin flitted over my mind i seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehendas men at times find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able in the end to remember my friend went on with his discourse you will see he said that i have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress it was my design to suggest the idea that both were effected in the same manner at the same point let us now revert to the interior of the room let us survey the appearances here the drawers of the bureau it is said had been rifled although many articles of apparel still remained within them the conclusion here is absurd it is a mere guesa very silly oneand no more how are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained madame lespanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired lifesaw no companyseldom went outhad little use for numerous changes of habiliment those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies if a thief had taken any why did he not take the bestwhy did he not take all in a word why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen the gold was abandoned nearly the whole sum mentioned by monsieur mignaud the banker was discovered in bags upon the floor i wish you therefore to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house coincidences ten times as remarkable as this the delivery of the money and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it happen to all of us every hour of our lives without attracting even momentary notice coincidences in general are great stumblingblocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilitiesthat theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration in the present instance had the gold been gone the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence it would have been corroborative of this idea of motive but under the real circumstances of the case if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together keeping now steadily in mind the points to which i have drawn your attentionthat peculiar voice that unusual agility and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as thislet us glance at the butchery itself here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength and thrust up a chimney head downward ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this least of all do they thus dispose of the murdered in the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney you will admit that there was something excessively outrésomething altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men think too how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigour of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down turn now to other indications of the employment of a vigour most marvellous on the hearth were thick tressesvery thick tressesof grey human hair these had been torn out by the roots you are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together you saw the locks in question as well as myself their roots a hideous sight were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalpsure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time the throat of the old lady was not merely cut but the head absolutely severed from the body the instrument was a mere razor i wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds of the bruises upon the body of madame lespanaye i do not speak monsieur dumas and his worthy coadjutor monsieur etienne have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument and so far these gentlemen are very correct the obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed this idea however simple it may now seem escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped thembecause by the affair of the nails their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all if now in addition to all these things you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding a strength superhuman a ferocity brutal a butchery without motive a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification what result then has ensued what impression have i made upon your fancy i felt a creeping of the flesh as dupin asked me the question a madman i said has done this deedsome raving maniac escaped from a neighbouring maison de santé in some respects he replied your idea is not irrelevant but the voices of madmen even in their wildest paroxysms are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs madmen are of some nation and their language however incoherent in its words has always the coherence of syllabification besides the hair of a madman is not such as i now hold in my hand i disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of madame lespanaye tell me what you can make of it dupin i said completely unnerved this hair is most unusualthis is no human hair i have not asserted that it is said he but before we decide this point i wish you to glance at the little sketch i have here traced upon this paper it is a facsimile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as dark bruises and deep indentations of finger nails upon the throat of mademoiselle lespanaye and in another by messrs dumas and etienne as a series of livid spots evidently the impression of fingers you will perceive continued my friend spreading out the paper upon the table before us that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold there is no slipping apparent each finger has retainedpossibly until the death of the victimthe fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself attempt now to place all your fingers at the same time in the respective impressions as you see them i made the attempt in vain we are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial he said the paper is spread out upon a plane surface but the human throat is cylindrical here is a billet of wood the circumference of which is about that of the throat wrap the drawing around it and try the experiment again i did so but the difficulty was even more obvious than before this i said is the mark of no human hand read now replied dupin this passage from cuvier it was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous ourangoutang of the east indian islands the gigantic stature the prodigious strength and activity the wild ferocity and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all i understood the full horrors of the murder at once the description of the digits said i as i made an end of reading is in exact accordance with this drawing i see that no animal but an ourangoutang of the species here mentioned could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them this tuft of tawny hair too is identical in character with that of the beast of cuvier but i cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery besides there were two voices heard in contention and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a frenchman true and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously by the evidence to this voicethe expression mon dieu this under the circumstances has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses montani the confectioner as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation upon these two words therefore i have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle a frenchman was cognizant of the murder it is possibleindeed it is far more than probablethat he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place the ourangoutang may have escaped from him he may have traced it to the chamber but under the agitating circumstances which ensued he could never have recaptured it it is still at large i will not pursue these guessesfor i have no right to call them moresince the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect and since i could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another we will call them guesses then and speak of them as such if the frenchman in question is indeed as i suppose innocent of this atrocity this advertisement which i left last night upon our return home at the office of le monde a paper devoted to the shipping interest and much sought by sailors will bring him to our residence he handed me a paper and i read thus caughtin the bois de boulogne early in the morning of theinst the morning of the murder a very large tawny ourangoutang of the bornese species the owner who is ascertained to be a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel may have the animal again upon identifying it satisfactorily and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping call at no rue faubourg st germainau troisième how was it possible i asked that you should know the man to be a sailor and belonging to a maltese vessel i do not know it said dupin i am not sure of it here however is a small piece of ribbon which from its form and from its greasy appearance has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond moreover this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie and is peculiar to the maltese i picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightningrod it could not have belonged to either of the deceased now if after all i am wrong in my induction from this ribbon that the frenchman was a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel still i can have done no harm in saying what i did in the advertisement if i am in error he will merely suppose that i have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire but if i am right a great point is gained cognizant although innocent of the murder the frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisementabout demanding the ourangoutang he will reason thus i am innocent i am poor my ourangoutang is of great valueto one in my circumstances a fortune of itselfwhy should i lose it through idle apprehensions of danger here it is within my grasp it was found in the bois de boulogneat a vast distance from the scene of that butchery how can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed the police are at faultthey have failed to procure the slightest clew should they even trace the animal it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance above all i am known the advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast i am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend should i avoid claiming a property of so great value which it is known that i possess i will render the animal at least liable to suspicion it is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast i will answer the advertisement get the ourangoutang and keep it close until this matter has blown over at this moment we heard a step upon the stairs be ready said dupin with your pistols but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself the front door of the house had been left open and the visitor had entered without ringing and advanced several steps upon the staircase now however he seemed to hesitate presently we heard him descending dupin was moving quickly to the door when we again heard him coming up he did not turn back a second time but stepped up with decision and rapped at the door of our chamber come in said dupin in a cheerful and hearty tone a man entered he was a sailor evidentlya tall stout and muscularlooking person with a certain daredevil expression of countenance not altogether unprepossessing his face greatly sunburnt was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio he had with him a huge oaken cudgel but appeared to be otherwise unarmed he bowed awkwardly and bade us good evening in french accents which although somewhat neufchatelish were still sufficiently indicative of a parisian origin sit down my friend said dupin i suppose you have called about the ourangoutang upon my word i almost envy you the possession of him a remarkably fine and no doubt a very valuable animal how old do you suppose him to be the sailor drew a long breath with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden and then replied in an assured tone i have no way of tellingbut he cant be more than four or five years old have you got him here oh no we had no conveniences for keeping him here he is at a livery stable in the rue dubourg just by you can get him in the morning of course you are prepared to identify the property to be sure i am sir i shall be sorry to part with him said dupin i dont mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing sir said the man couldnt expect it am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animalthat is to say any thing in reason well replied my friend that is all very fair to be sure let me thinkwhat should i have oh i will tell you my reward shall be this you shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the rue morgue dupin said the last words in a very low tone and very quietly just as quietly too he walked toward the door locked it and put the key in his pocket he then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it without the least flurry upon the table the sailors face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation he started to his feet and grasped his cudgel but the next moment he fell back into his seat trembling violently and with the countenance of death itself he spoke not a word i pitied him from the bottom of my heart my friend said dupin in a kind tone you are alarming yourself unnecessarilyyou are indeed we mean you no harm whatever i pledge you the honour of a gentleman and of a frenchman that we intend you no injury i perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the rue morgue it will not do however to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them from what i have already said you must know that i have had means of information about this mattermeans of which you could never have dreamed now the thing stands thus you have done nothing which you could have avoidednothing certainly which renders you culpable you were not even guilty of robbery when you might have robbed with impunity you have nothing to conceal you have no reason for concealment on the other hand you are bound by every principle of honour to confess all you know an innocent man is now imprisoned charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator the sailor had recovered his presence of mind in a great measure while dupin uttered these words but his original boldness of bearing was all gone so help me god said he after a brief pause i will tell you all i know about this affairbut i do not expect you to believe one half i sayi would be a fool indeed if i did still i am innocent and i will make a clean breast if i die for it what he stated was in substance this he had lately made a voyage to the indian archipelago a party of which he formed one landed at borneo and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure himself and a companion had captured the ourangoutang this companion dying the animal fell into his own exclusive possession after great trouble occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in paris where not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbours he kept it carefully secluded until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot received from a splinter on board ship his ultimate design was to sell it returning home from some sailors frolic on the night or rather in the morning of the murder he found the beast occupying his own bedroom into which it had broken from a closet adjoining where it had been as was thought securely confined razor in hand and fully lathered it was sitting before a lookingglass attempting the operation of shaving in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the keyhole of the closet terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious and so well able to use it the man for some moments was at a loss what to do he had been accustomed however to quiet the creature even in its fiercest moods by the use of a whip and to this he now resorted upon sight of it the ourangoutang sprang at once through the door of the chamber down the stairs and thence through a window unfortunately open into the street the frenchman followed in despair the ape razor still in hand occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer until the latter had nearly come up with it it then again made off in this manner the chase continued for a long time the streets were profoundly quiet as it was nearly three oclock in the morning in passing down an alley in the rear of the rue morgue the fugitives attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of madame lespanayes chamber in the fourth story of her house rushing to the building it perceived the lightningrod clambered up with inconceivable agility grasped the shutter which was thrown fully back against the wall and by its means swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed the whole feat did not occupy a minute the shutter was kicked open again by the ourangoutang as it entered the room the sailor in the meantime was both rejoiced and perplexed he had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured except by the rod where it might be intercepted as it came down on the other hand there was cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house this latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive a lightningrod is ascended without difficulty especially by a sailor but when he had arrived as high as the window which lay far to his left his career was stopped the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room at this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night which had startled from slumber the inmates of the rue morgue madame lespanaye and her daughter habited in their night clothes had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned which had been wheeled into the middle of the room it was open and its contents lay beside it on the floor the victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window and from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived the flappingto of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind as the sailor looked in the gigantic animal had seized madame lespanaye by the hair which was loose as she had been combing it and was flourishing the razor about her face in imitation of the motions of a barber the daughter lay prostrate and motionless she had swooned the screams and struggles of the old lady during which the hair was torn from her head had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the ourangoutang into those of wrath with one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body the sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy gnashing its teeth and flashing fire from its eyes it flew upon the body of the girl and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat retaining its grasp until she expired its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed over which the face of its master rigid with horror was just discernible the fury of the beast who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip was instantly converted into fear conscious of having deserved punishment it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved and dragging the bed from the bedstead in conclusion it seized first the corpse of the daughter and thrust it up the chimney as it was found then that of the old lady which it immediately hurled through the window headlong as the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden the sailor shrank aghast to the rod and rather gliding than clambering down it hurried at once homedreading the consequences of the butchery and gladly abandoning in his terror all solicitude about the fate of the ourangoutang the words heard by the party upon the staircase were the frenchmans exclamations of horror and affright commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute i have scarcely anything to add the ourangoutang must have escaped from the chamber by the rod just before the breaking of the door it must have closed the window as it passed through it it was subsequently caught by the owner himself who obtained for it a very large sum at the jardin des plantes le bon was instantly released upon our narration of the circumstances with some comments from dupin at the bureau of the prefect of police this functionary however well disposed to my friend could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two about the propriety of every person minding his own business let him talk said dupin who had not thought it necessary to reply let him discourse it will ease his conscience i am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle nevertheless that he failed in the solution of this mystery is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it for in truth our friend the prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound in his wisdom is no stamen it is all head and no body like the pictures of the goddess lavernaor at best all head and shoulders like a codfish but he is a good creature after all i like him especially for one master stroke of cant by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity i mean the way he has de nier ce qui est et dexpliquer ce qui nest pas rousseau nouvelle heloise bret harte it may at first seem surprising that the writer best known for putting the california of gold rush days on the literary map also produced the stolen cigar case a story widely regarded as the quintessential sherlockian parody but bret harte who also did a great deal to establish the formula used in westerns to this day was a master of generic conventions and a skilled editor and literary critic this story and others collected in two volumes of condensed novels were written to indulge hartes passion for critiquing the very conventions that were the mainstays of his and other writers popular success born francis bret harte in albany new york in he was a precocious child who at the age of five burlesqued his school primers he was raised in the eastern united states where he moved from school to school according to his fathers varying ability to pay tuition his father changed the family name to harte a year before he died soon afterward the teenage harte began to support himself establishing a lifelong pattern of moving from job to job while pursuing his writing at the age of eighteen harte joined his remarried mother in california where he was to spend the next sixteen years of his life his first six years out west were not successful in terms of either literary or ordinary employment but in drifting from job to job and dabbling in experiences like riding shotgun on a stagecoach and tutoring ranchers children he gathered a wealth of material that he would mine for years as he put bret harte country on the literary map hartes connections with literary journals and newspapers ranged from writing for them to physically printing them he simultaneously lost his job and made a name for himself when in february he strongly editorialised about a massacre of indians perpetrated by whites left in charge of the northern californian while the editor was away he printed such bold statements about a rival paper and the local sheriff that he was fired within the month in his nonfiction and lectures harte revealed that he despised the corruption and lawlessness of the very world in which he chose to set his fiction in his literary criticism he disdained the use of formula and stock characters while unabashedly using both to his advantage in his highly popular fiction if the stolen cigar case is one of hartes most lasting gems it may be because in it he could dissect and use to his advantage both formula and someone elses stock characters and at the same time he could indulge a bad boys sense of play the stolen cigar case i found hemlock jones in the old brook street lodgings musing before the fire with the freedom of an old friend i at once threw myself in my usual familiar attitude at his feet and gently caressed his boot i was induced to do this for two reasons one that it enabled me to get a good look at his bent concentrated face and the other that it seemed to indicate my reverence for his superhuman insight so absorbed was he even then in tracking some mysterious clue that he did not seem to notice me but therein i was wrongas i always was in my attempt to understand that powerful intellect it is raining he said without lifting his head you have been out then i said quickly no but i see that your umbrella is wet and that your overcoat has drops of water on it i sat aghast at his penetration after a pause he said carelessly as if dismissing the subject besides i hear the rain on the window listen i listened i could scarcely credit my ears but there was the soft pattering of drops on the panes it was evident there was no deceiving this man have you been busy lately i asked changing the subject what new problemgiven up by scotland yard as inscrutablehas occupied that gigantic intellect he drew back his foot slightly and seemed to hesitate ere he returned it to its original position then he answered wearily mere triflesnothing to speak of the prince kupoli has been here to get my advice regarding the disappearance of certain rubies from the kremlin the rajah of pootibad after vainly beheading his entire bodyguard has been obliged to seek my assistance to recover a jewelled sword the grand duchess of pretzelbrauntswig is desirous of discovering where her husband was on the night of february and last nighthe lowered his voice slightlya lodger in this very house meeting me on the stairs wanted to know why they didnt answer his bell i could not help smilinguntil i saw a frown gathering on his inscrutable forehead pray remember he said coldly that it was through such an apparently trivial question that i found out why paul ferroll killed his wife and what happened to jones i became dumb at once he paused for a moment and then suddenly changing back to his usual pitiless analytical style he said when i say these are trifles they are so in comparison to an affair that is now before me a crime has been committedand singularly enough against myself you start he said you wonder who would have dared to attempt it so did i nevertheless it has been done i have been robbed you robbed you hemlock jones the terror of peculators i gasped in amazement arising and gripping the table as i faced him yes listen i would confess it to no other but you who have followed my career who know my methods you for whom i have partly lifted the veil that conceals my plans from ordinary humanityyou who have for years rapturously accepted my confidences passionately admired my inductions and inferences placed yourself at my beck and call become my slave grovelled at my feet given up your practice except those few unremunerative and rapidly decreasing patients to whom in moments of abstraction over my problems you have administered strychnine for quinine and arsenic for epsom salts you who have sacrificed anything and everybody to meyou i make my confidant i arose and embraced him warmly yet he was already so engrossed in thought that at the same moment he mechanically placed his hand upon his watch chain as if to consult the time sit down he said have a cigar i have given up cigar smoking i said why he asked i hesitated and perhaps coloured i had really given it up because with my diminished practice it was too expensive i could afford only a pipe i prefer a pipe i said laughingly but tell me of this robbery what have you lost he arose and planting himself before the fire with his hands under his coattails looked down upon me reflectively for a moment do you remember the cigar case presented to me by the turkish ambassador for discovering the missing favourite of the grand vizier in the fifth chorus girl at the hilarity theatre it was that one i mean the cigar case it was incrusted with diamonds and the largest one had been supplanted by paste i said ah he said with a reflective smile you know that you told me yourself i remember considering it a proof of your extraordinary perception but by jove you dont mean to say you have lost it he was silent for a moment no it has been stolen it is true but i shall still find it and by myself alone in your profession my dear fellow when a member is seriously ill he does not prescribe for himself but calls in a brother doctor therein we differ i shall take this matter in my own hands and where could you find better i said enthusiastically i should say the cigar case is as good as recovered already i shall remind you of that again he said lightly and now to show you my confidence in your judgment in spite of my determination to pursue this alone i am willing to listen to any suggestions from you he drew a memorandum book from his pocket and with a grave smile took up his pencil i could scarcely believe my senses he the great hemlock jones accepting suggestions from a humble individual like myself i kissed his hand reverently and began in a joyous tone first i should advertise offering a reward i should give the same intimation in handbills distributed at the pubs and the pastrycooks i should next visit the different pawnbrokers i should give notice at the police station i should examine the servants i should thoroughly search the house and my own pockets i speak relatively i added with a laugh of course i mean your own he gravely made an entry of these details perhaps i added you have already done this perhaps he returned enigmatically now my dear friend he continued putting the notebook in his pocket and rising would you excuse me for a few moments make yourself perfectly at home until i return there may be some things he added with a sweep of his hand toward his heterogeneously filled shelves that may interest you and while away the time there are pipes and tobacco in that corner then nodding to me with the same inscrutable face he left the room i was too well accustomed to his methods to think much of his unceremonious withdrawal and made no doubt he was off to investigate some clue which had suddenly occurred to his active intelligence left to myself i cast a cursory glance over his shelves there were a number of small glass jars containing earthy substances labelled pavement and road sweepings from the principal thoroughfares and suburbs of london with the subdirections for identifying foottracks there were several other jars labelled fluff from omnibus and road car seats cocoanut fibre and rope strands from mattings in public places cigarette stumps and match ends from floor of palace theatre row a to everywhere were evidences of this wonderful mans system and perspicacity i was thus engaged when i heard the slight creaking of a door and i looked up as a stranger entered he was a roughlooking man with a shabby overcoat and a still more disreputable muffler around his throat and the lower part of his face considerably annoyed at his intrusion i turned upon him rather sharply when with a mumbled growling apology for mistaking the room he shuffled out again and closed the door i followed him quickly to the landing and saw that he disappeared down the stairs with my mind full of the robbery the incident made a singular impression upon me i knew my friends habit of hasty absences from his room in his moments of deep inspiration it was only too probable that with his powerful intellect and magnificent perceptive genius concentrated on one subject he should be careless of his own belongings and no doubt even forget to take the ordinary precaution of locking up his drawers i tried one or two and found that i was right although for some reason i was unable to open one to its fullest extent the handles were sticky as if some one had opened them with dirty fingers knowing hemlocks fastidious cleanliness i resolved to inform him of this circumstance but i forgot it alas untilbut i am anticipating my story his absence was strangely prolonged i at last seated myself by the fire and lulled by warmth and the patter of the rain on the window i fell asleep i may have dreamt for during my sleep i had a vague semiconsciousness as of hands being softly pressed on my pockets no doubt induced by the story of the robbery when i came fully to my senses i found hemlock jones sitting on the other side of the hearth his deeply concentrated gaze fixed on the fire i found you so comfortably asleep that i could not bear to awaken you he said with a smile i rubbed my eyes and what news i asked how have you succeeded better than i expected he said and i think he added tapping his notebook i owe much to you deeply gratified i awaited more but in vain i ought to have remembered that in his moods hemlock jones was reticence itself i told him simply of the strange intrusion but he only laughed later when i arose to go he looked at me playfully if you were a married man he said i would advise you not to go home until you had brushed your sleeve there are a few short brown sealskin hairs on the inner side of your forearm just where they would have adhered if your arm had encircled a sealskin coat with some pressure for once you are at fault i said triumphantly the hair is my own as you will perceive i have just had it cut at the hairdressers and no doubt this arm projected beyond the apron he frowned slightly yet nevertheless on my turning to go he embraced me warmlya rare exhibition in that man of ice he even helped me on with my overcoat and pulled out and smoothed down the flaps of my pockets he was particular too in fitting my arm in my overcoat sleeve shaking the sleeve down from the armhole to the cuff with his deft fingers come again soon he said clapping me on the back at any and all times i said enthusiastically i only ask ten minutes twice a day to eat a crust at my office and four hours sleep at night and the rest of my time is devoted to you always as you know it is indeed he said with his impenetrable smile nevertheless i did not find him at home when i next called one afternoon when nearing my own home i met him in one of his favourite disguisesa long blue swallowtailed coat striped cotton trousers large turnover collar blacked face and white hat carrying a tambourine of course to others the disguise was perfect although it was known to myself and i passed himaccording to an old understanding between uswithout the slightest recognition trusting to a later explanation at another time as i was making a professional visit to the wife of a publican at the east end i saw him in the disguise of a brokendown artisan looking into the window of an adjacent pawnshop i was delighted to see that he was evidently following my suggestions and in my joy i ventured to tip him a wink it was abstractedly returned two days later i received a note appointing a meeting at his lodgings that night that meeting alas was the one memorable occurrence of my life and the last meeting i ever had with hemlock jones i will try to set it down calmly though my pulses still throb with the recollection of it i found him standing before the fire with that look upon his face which i had seen only once or twice in our acquaintancea look which i may call an absolute concatenation of inductive and deductive ratiocinationfrom which all that was human tender or sympathetic was absolutely discharged he was simply an icy algebraic symbol indeed his whole being was concentrated to that extent that his clothes fitted loosely and his head was absolutely so much reduced in size by his mental compression that his hat tipped back from his forehead and literally hung on his massive ears after i had entered he locked the doors fastened the windows and even placed a chair before the chimney as i watched these significant precautions with absorbing interest he suddenly drew a revolver and presenting it to my temple said in low icy tones hand over that cigar case even in my bewilderment my reply was truthful spontaneous and involuntary i havent got it i said he smiled bitterly and threw down his revolver i expected that reply then let me now confront you with something more awful more deadly more relentless and convincing than that mere lethal weaponthe damning inductive and deductive proofs of your guilt he drew from his pocket a roll of paper and a notebook but surely i gasped you are joking you could not for a moment believe silence sit down i obeyed you have condemned yourself he went on pitilessly condemned yourself on my processesprocesses familiar to you applauded by you accepted by you for years we will go back to the time when you first saw the cigar case your expressions he said in cold deliberate tones consulting his paper were how beautiful i wish it were mine this was your first step in crimeand my first indication from i wish it were mine to i will have it mine and the mere detail how can i make it mine the advance was obvious silence but as in my methods it was necessary that there should be an overwhelming inducement to the crime that unholy admiration of yours for the mere trinket itself was not enough you are a smoker of cigars but i burst out passionately i told you i had given up smoking cigars fool he said coldly that is the second time you have committed yourself of course you told me what more natural than for you to blazon forth that prepared and unsolicited statement to prevent accusation yet as i said before even that wretched attempt to cover up your tracks was not enough i still had to find that overwhelming impelling motive necessary to affect a man like you that motive i found in the strongest of all impulseslove i suppose you would call it he added bitterly that night you called you had brought the most conclusive proofs of it on your sleeve but i almost screamed silence he thundered i know what you would say you would say that even if you had embraced some young person in a sealskin coat what had that to do with the robbery let me tell you then that that sealskin coat represented the quality and character of your fatal entanglement you bartered your honour for itthat stolen cigar case was the purchaser of the sealskin coat silence having thoroughly established your motive i now proceed to the commission of the crime itself ordinary people would have begun with thatwith an attempt to discover the whereabouts of the missing object these are not my methods so overpowering was his penetration that although i knew myself innocent i licked my lips with avidity to hear the further details of this lucid exposition of my crime you committed that theft the night i showed you the cigar case and after i had carelessly thrown it in that drawer you were sitting in that chair and i had arisen to take something from that shelf in that instant you secured your booty without rising silence do you remember when i helped you on with your overcoat the other night i was particular about fitting your arm in while doing so i measured your arm with a spring tape measure from the shoulder to the cuff a later visit to your tailor confirmed that measurement it proved to be the exact distance between your chair and that drawer i sat stunned the rest are mere corroborative details you were again tampering with the drawer when i discovered you doing so do not start the stranger that blundered into the room with a muffler onwas myself more i had placed a little soap on the drawer handles when i purposely left you alone the soap was on your hand when i shook it at parting i softly felt your pockets when you were asleep for further developments i embraced you when you leftthat i might feel if you had the cigar case or any other articles hidden on your body this confirmed me in the belief that you had already disposed of it in the manner and for the purpose i have shown you as i still believed you capable of remorse and confession i twice allowed you to see i was on your track once in the garb of an itinerant negro minstrel and the second time as a workman looking in the window of the pawnshop where you pledged your booty but i burst out if you had asked the pawnbroker you would have seen how unjust fool he hissed that was one of your suggestionsto search the pawnshops do you suppose i followed any of your suggestions the suggestions of the thief on the contrary they told me what to avoid and i suppose i said bitterly you have not even searched your drawer no he said calmly i was for the first time really vexed i went to the nearest drawer and pulled it out sharply it stuck as it had before leaving a part of the drawer unopened by working it however i discovered that it was impeded by some obstacle that had slipped to the upper part of the drawer and held it firmly fast inserting my hand i pulled out the impeding object it was the missing cigar case i turned to him with a cry of joy but i was appalled at his expression a look of contempt was now added to his acute penetrating gaze i have been mistaken he said slowly i had not allowed for your weakness and cowardice i thought too highly of you even in your guilt but i see now why you tampered with that drawer the other night by some inexplicable meanspossibly another theftyou took the cigar case out of pawn and like a whipped hound restored it to me in this feeble clumsy fashion you thought to deceive me hemlock jones more you thought to destroy my infallibility go i give you your liberty i shall not summon the three policemen who wait in the adjoining roombut out of my sight forever as i stood once more dazed and petrified he took me firmly by the ear and led me into the hall closing the door behind him this reopened presently wide enough to permit him to thrust out my hat overcoat umbrella and overshoes and then closed against me forever i never saw him again i am bound to say however that thereafter my business increased i recovered much of my old practice and a few of my patients recovered also i became rich i had a brougham and a house in the west end but i often wondered pondering on that wonderful mans penetration and insight if in some lapse of consciousness i had not really stolen his cigar case jacques futrelle critics agree that when boston journalist jacques futrelle went down with the titanic at the age of thirtyseven the world lost an innovative master of the short story the georgiaborn author also penned novels that have not stood the test of time but his short stories gave us his great achievement the american prototype of the scientific sleuth there is no doubt that futrelle was building on the creations of eugene francois vidocq edgar allan poe and sir arthur conan doyle when he invented professor s f x van dusen ph d ll d f r s and m d however no reader is likely to mistake van dusen for sherlock holmes despite their cerebral similarities with his outsize cranium his mane of yellow hair his petite body and his arrogant freakishness van dusen cant be imagined as welcome among the uppercrust british and van dusens character fits the american mould his superlative reasoning powers are accompanied by a cando attitude that leads him to declare nothing is impossible how about an airship his friend challenges him thats not impossible at all van dusen asserts it will be invented sometime id do it myself but im busy dubbed the thinking machine by the press after a remarkable exhibition at chess the professor is aided by newspaper reporter hutchinson hatch who runs the research and rescue operations while van dusen does the thinking setting the stage for sidekicks like archie goodwin in rex stouts later nero wolfe stories and paul drake in erie stanley gardners perry mason mysteries hatch is the more physically active partner futrelle was on the editorial staff of the boston american when the problem of cell made him famous like most of his thinking machine stories it was first published in that newspaper the predecessor of the presentday boston herald with a challenge to the reader to furnish a solution the story demonstrates the authors forte in the lockedroom branch of detective fiction with the thinking machine taking up a challenge to escape from a maximumsecurity prison cell with nothing but shoes stockings trousers and shirtand of course his power to think the problem of cell i practically all those letters remaining in the alphabet after augustus s f x van dusen was named were afterward acquired by that gentleman in the course of a brilliant scientific career and being honourably acquired were tacked on to the other end his name therefore taken with all that belonged to it was a wonderfully imposing structure he was a ph d an ll d an f r s an m d and an m d s he was also some other thingsjust what he himself couldnt saythrough recognition of his ability by various foreign educational and scientific institutions in appearance he was no less striking than in nomenclature he was slender with the droop of the student in his thin shoulders and the pallor of a close sedentary life on his cleanshaven face his eyes wore a perpetual forbidding squintof a man who studies little thingsand when they could be seen at all through his thick spectacles were mere slits of watery blue but above his eyes was his most striking feature this was a tall broad brow almost abnormal in height and width crowned by a heavy shock of bushy yellow hair all these things conspired to give him a peculiar almost grotesque personality professor van dusen was remotely german for generations his ancestors had been noted in the sciences he was the logical result the master mind first and above all he was a logician at least thirtyfive years of the halfcentury or so of his existence had been devoted exclusively to proving that two and two always equal four except in unusual cases where they equal three or five as the case may be he stood broadly on the general proposition that all things that start must go somewhere and was able to bring the concentrated mental force of his forefathers to bear on a given problem incidentally it may be remarked that professor van dusen wore a no hat the world at large had heard vaguely of professor van dusen as the thinking machine it was a newspaper catchphrase applied to him at the time of a remarkable exhibition at chess he had demonstrated then that a stranger to the game might by the force of inevitable logic defeat a champion who had devoted a lifetime to its study the thinking machine perhaps that more nearly described him than all his honorary initials for he spent week after week month after month in the seclusion of his small laboratory from which had gone forth thoughts that staggered scientific associates and deeply stirred the world at large it was only occasionally that the thinking machine had visitors and these were usually men who themselves high in the sciences dropped in to argue a point and perhaps convince themselves two of these men dr charles ransome and alfred fielding called one evening to discuss some theory which is not of consequence here such a thing is impossible declared dr ransome emphatically in the course of the conversation nothing is impossible declared the thinking machine with equal emphasis he always spoke petulantly the mind is master of all things when science fully recognises that fact a great advance will have been made how about the airship asked dr ransome thats not impossible at all asserted the thinking machine it will be invented some time id do it myself but im busy dr ransome laughed tolerantly ive heard you say such things before he said but they mean nothing mind may be master of matter but it hasnt yet found a way to apply itself there are some things that cant be thought out of existence or rather which would not yield to any amount of thinking what for instance demanded the thinking machine dr ransome was thoughtful for a moment as he smoked well say prison walls he replied no man can think himself out of a cell if he could there would be no prisoners a man can so apply his brain and ingenuity that he can leave a cell which is the same thing snapped the thinking machine dr ransome was slightly amused lets suppose a case he said after a moment take a cell where prisoners under sentence of death are confinedmen who are desperate and maddened by fear would take any chance to escapesuppose you were locked in such a cell could you escape certainly declared the thinking machine of course said mr fielding who entered the conversation for the first time you might wreck the cell with an explosivebut inside a prisoner you couldnt have that there would be nothing of that kind said the thinking machine you might treat me precisely as you treated prisoners under sentence of death and i would leave the cell not unless you entered it with tools prepared to get out said dr ransome the thinking machine was visibly annoyed and his blue eyes snapped lock me in any cell in any prison anywhere at any time wearing only what is necessary and ill escape in a week he declared sharply dr ransome sat up straight in the chair interested mr fielding lighted a new cigar you mean you could actually think yourself out asked dr ransome i would get out was the response are you serious certainly i am serious dr ransome and mr fielding were silent for a long time would you be willing to try it asked mr fielding finally certainly said professor van dusen and there was a trace of irony in his voice i have done more asinine things than that to convince other men of less important truths the tone was offensive and there was an undercurrent strongly resembling anger on both sides of course it was an absurd thing but professor van dusen reiterated his willingness to undertake the escape and it was decided upon to begin now added dr ransome id prefer that it begin tomorrow said the thinking machine because no now said mr fielding flatly you are arrested figuratively of course without any warning locked in a cell with no chance to communicate with friends and left there with identically the same care and attention that would be given to a man under sentence of death are you willing all right now then said the thinking machine and he arose say the deathcell in chisholm prison the deathcell in chisholm prison and what will you wear as little as possible said the thinking machine shoes stockings trousers and a shirt you will permit yourself to be searched of course i am to be treated precisely as all prisoners are treated said the thinking machine no more attention and no less there were some preliminaries to be arranged in the matter of obtaining permission for the test but all three were influential men and everything was done satisfactorily by telephone albeit the prison commissioners to whom the experiment was explained on purely scientific grounds were sadly bewildered professor van dusen would be the most distinguished prisoner they had ever entertained when the thinking machine had donned those things which he was to wear during his incarceration he called the little old woman who was his housekeeper cook and maidservant all in one martha he said it is now twentyseven minutes past nine oclock i am going away one week from tonight at halfpast nine these gentlemen and one possibly two others will take supper with me here remember dr ransome is very fond of artichokes the three men were driven to chisholm prison where the warden was awaiting them having been informed of the matter by telephone he understood merely that the eminent professor van dusen was to be his prisoner if he could keep him for one week that he had committed no crime but that he was to be treated as all other prisoners were treated search him instructed dr ransome the thinking machine was searched nothing was found on him the pockets of the trousers were empty the white stiffbosomed shirt had no pocket the shoes and stockings were removed examined then replaced as he watched all these preliminariesthe rigid search and noted the pitiful childlike physical weakness of the man the colourless face and the thin white handsdr ransome almost regretted his part in the affair are you sure you want to do this he asked would you be convinced if i did not inquired the thinking machine in turn no all right ill do it what sympathy dr ransome had was dissipated by the tone it nettled him and he resolved to see the experiment to the end it would be a stinging reproof to egotism it will be impossible for him to communicate with any one outside he asked absolutely impossible replied the warden he will not be permitted writing materials of any sort and your jailers would they deliver a message from him not one word directly or indirectly said the warden you may rest assured of that they will report anything he might say or turn over to me anything he might give them that seems entirely satisfactory said mr fielding who was frankly interested in the problem of course in the event he fails said dr ransome and asks for his liberty you understand you are to set him free i understand replied the warden the thinking machine stood listening but had nothing to say until this was all ended then i should like to make three small requests you may grant them or not as you wish no special favours now warned mr fielding i am asking none was the stiff response i would like to have some tooth powderbuy it yourself to see that it is tooth powderand i should like to have one fivedollar and two tendollar bills dr ransome mr fielding and the warden exchanged astonished glances they were not surprised at the request for tooth powder but were at the request for money is there any man with whom our friend would come in contact that he could bribe with twentyfive dollars asked dr ransome of the warden not for twentyfive hundred dollars was the positive reply well let him have them said mr fielding i think they are harmless enough and what is the third request asked dr ransome i should like to have my shoes polished again the astonished glances were exchanged this last request was the height of absurdity so they agreed to it these things all being attended to the thinking machine was led back into the prison from which he had undertaken to escape here is cell said the warden stopping three doors down the steel corridor this is where we keep condemned murderers no one can leave it without my permission and no one in it can communicate with the outside ill stake my reputation on that its only three doors back of my office and i can readily hear any unusual noise will this cell do gentlemen asked the thinking machine there was a touch of irony in his voice admirably was the reply the heavy steel door was thrown open there was a great scurrying and scampering of tiny feet and the thinking machine passed into the gloom of the cell then the door was closed and double locked by the warden what is that noise in there asked dr ransome through the bars ratsdozens of them replied the thinking machine tersely the three men with final good nights were turning away when the thinking machine called what time is it exactly warden eleven seventeen replied the warden thanks i will join you gentlemen in your office at halfpast eight oclock one week from tonight said the thinking machine and if you do not there is no if about it ii chisholm prison was a great spreading structure of granite four stories in all which stood in the centre of acres of open space it was surrounded by a wall of solid masonry eighteen feet high and so smoothly finished inside and out as to offer no foothold to a climber no matter how expert atop of this fence as a further precaution was a fivefoot fence of steel rods each terminating in a keen point this fence in itself marked an absolute deadline between freedom and imprisonment for even if a man escaped from his cell it would seem impossible for him to pass the wall the yard which on all sides of the prison building was twentyfive feet wide that being the distance from the building to the wall was by day an exercise ground for those prisoners to whom was granted the boon of occasional semiliberty but that was not for those in cell at all times of the day there were armed guards in the yard four of them one patrolling each side of the prison building by night the yard was almost as brilliantly lighted as by day on each of the four sides was a great arc light which rose above the prison wall and gave to the guards a clear sight the lights too brightly illuminated the spiked top of the wall the wires which fed the arc light ran up the side of the prison building on insulators and from the top story led out to the poles supporting the arc lights all these things were seen and comprehended by the thinking machine who was only enabled to see out his closely barred cell window by standing on his bed this was on the morning following his incarceration he gathered too that the river lay over there beyond the wall somewhere because he heard faintly the pulsation of a motor boat and high up in the air saw a river bird from that same direction came the shouts of boys at play and the occasional crack of a batted ball he knew then that between the prison wall and the river was an open space a playground chisholm prison was regarded as absolutely safe no man had ever escaped from it the thinking machine from his perch on the bed seeing what he saw could readily understand why the walls of the cell though built he judged twenty years before were perfectly solid and the window bars of new iron had not a shadow of rust on them the window itself even with the bars out would be a difficult mode of egress because it was small yet seeing these things the thinking machine was not discouraged instead he thoughtfully squinted at the great arc lightthere was bright sunlight nowand traced with his eyes the wire which led from it to the building that electric wire he reasoned must come down the side of the building not a great distance from his cell that might be worth knowing cell was on the same floor with the offices of the prisonthat is not in the basement nor yet upstairs there were only four steps up to the office floor therefore the level of the floor must be only three or four feet above the ground he couldnt see the ground directly beneath his window but he could see it further out toward the wall it would be an easy drop from the window well and good then the thinking machine fell to remembering how he had come to the cell first there was the outside guards booth a part of the wall there were two heavily barred gates there both of steel at this gate was one man always on guard he admitted persons to the prison after much clanking of keys and locks and let them out when ordered to do so the wardens office was in the prison building and in order to reach that official from the prison yard one had to pass a gate of solid steel with only a peephole in it then coming from that inner office to cell where he was now one must pass a heavy wooden door and two steel doors into the corridors of the prison and always there was the doublelocked door to cell to reckon with there were then the thinking machine recalled seven doors to be overcome before one could pass from cell into the outer world a free man but against this was the fact that he was rarely interrupted a jailer appeared at his cell door at six in the morning with a breakfast of prison fare he would come again at noon and again at six in the afternoon at nine oclock at night would come the inspection tour that would be all its admirably arranged this prison system was the mental tribute paid by the thinking machine ill have to study it a little when i get out i had no idea there was such great care exercised in the prisons there was nothing positively nothing in his cell except his iron bed so firmly put together that no man could tear it to pieces save with sledges or a file he had neither of these there was not even a chair or a small table or a bit of tin or crockery nothing the jailer stood by when he ate then took away the wooden spoon and bowl which he had used one by one these things sank into the brain of the thinking machine when the last possibility had been considered he began an examination of his cell from the roof down the walls on all sides he examined the stones and the cement between them he stamped over the floor carefully time after time but it was cement perfectly solid after the examination he sat on the edge of the iron bed and was lost in thought for a long time for professor augustus s f x van dusen the thinking machine had something to think about he was disturbed by a rat which ran across his foot then scampered away into a dark corner of the cell frightened at its own daring after a while the thinking machine squinting steadily into the darkness of the corner where the rat had gone was able to make out in the gloom many little beady eyes staring at him he counted six pair and there were perhaps others he didnt see very well then the thinking machine from his seat on the bed noticed for the first time the bottom of his cell door there was an opening there of two inches between the steel bar and the floor still looking steadily at this opening the thinking machine backed suddenly into the corner where he had seen the beady eyes there was a great scampering of tiny feet several squeaks of frightened rodents and then silence none of the rats had gone out the door yet there were none in the cell therefore there must be another way out of the cell however small the thinking machine on hands and knees started a search for this spot feeling in the darkness with his long slender fingers at last his search was rewarded he came upon a small opening in the floor level with the cement it was perfectly round and somewhat larger than a silver dollar this was the way the rats had gone he put his fingers deep into the opening it seemed to be a disused drainage pipe and was dry and dusty having satisfied himself on this point he sat on the bed again for an hour then made another inspection of his surroundings through the small cell window one of the outside guards stood directly opposite beside the wall and happened to be looking at the window of cell when the head of the thinking machine appeared but the scientist didnt notice the guard noon came and the jailer appeared with the prison dinner of repulsively plain food at home the thinking machine merely ate to live here he took what was offered without comment occasionally he spoke to the jailer who stood outside the door watching him any improvements made here in the last few years he asked nothing particularly replied the jailer new wall was built four years ago anything done to the prison proper painted the woodwork outside and i believe about seven years ago a new system of plumbing was put in ah said the prisoner how far is the river over there about three hundred feet the boys have a baseball ground between the wall and the river the thinking machine had nothing further to say just then but when the jailer was ready to go he asked for some water i get very thirsty here he explained would it be possible for you to leave a little water in a bowl for me ill ask the warden replied the jailer and he went away half an hour later he returned with water in a small earthen bowl the warden says you may keep this bowl he informed the prisoner but you must show it to me when i ask for it if it is broken it will be the last thank you said the thinking machine i shant break it the jailer went on about his duties for just the fraction of a second it seemed that the thinking machine wanted to ask a question but he didnt two hours later this same jailer in passing the door of cell no heard a noise inside and stopped the thinking machine was down on his hands and knees in a corner of the cell and from that same corner came several frightened squeaks the jailer looked on interestedly ah ive got you he heard the prisoner say got what he asked sharply one of these rats was the reply see and between the scientists long fingers the jailer saw a small gray rat struggling the prisoner brought it over to the light and looked at it closely its a water rat he said aint you got anything better to do than to catch rats asked the jailer its disgraceful that they should be here at all was the irritated reply take this one away and kill it there are dozens more where it came from the jailer took the wriggling squirmy rodent and flung it down on the floor violently it gave one squeak and lay still later he reported the incident to the warden who only smiled still later that afternoon the outside armed guard on cell side of the prison looked up again at the window and saw the prisoner looking out he saw a hand raised to the barred window and then something white fluttered to the ground directly under the window of cell it was a little roll of linen evidently of white shirting material and tied around it was a fivedollar bill the guard looked up at the window again but the face had disappeared with a grim smile he took the little linen roll and the fivedollar bill to the wardens office there together they deciphered something which was written on it with a queer sort of ink frequently blurred on the outside was this finder of this please deliver to dr charles ransome ah said the warden with a chuckle plan of escape number one has gone wrong then as an afterthought but why did he address it to dr ransome and where did he get the pen and ink to write with asked the guard the warden looked at the guard and the guard looked at the warden there was no apparent solution of that mystery the warden studied the writing carefully then shook his head well lets see what he was going to say to dr ransome he said at length still puzzled and he unrolled the inner piece of linen well if thatwhatwhat do you think of that he asked dazed the guard took the bit of linen and read this epa cseot dnet niiy awe htto nsi sih t iii the warden spent an hour wondering what sort of a cipher it was and half an hour wondering why his prisoner should attempt to communicate with dr ransome who was the cause of him being there after this the warden devoted some thought to the question of where the prisoner got writing materials and what sort of writing materials he had with the idea of illuminating this point he examined the linen again it was a torn part of a white shirt and had ragged edges now it was possible to account for the linen but what the prisoner had used to write with was another matter the warden knew it would have been impossible for him to have either pen or pencil and besides neither pen nor pencil had been used in this writing what then the warden decided to personally investigate the thinking machine was his prisoner he had orders to hold his prisoners if this one sought to escape by sending cipher messages to persons outside he would stop it as he would have stopped it in the case of any other prisoner the warden went back to cell and found the thinking machine on his hands and knees on the floor engaged in nothing more alarming than catching rats the prisoner heard the wardens step and turned to him quickly its disgraceful he snapped these rats there are scores of them other men have been able to stand them said the warden here is another shirt for youlet me have the one you have on why demanded the thinking machine quickly his tone was hardly natural his manner suggested actual perturbation you have attempted to communicate with dr ransome said the warden severely as my prisoner it is my duty to put a stop to it the thinking machine was silent for a moment all right he said finally do your duty the warden smiled grimly the prisoner arose from the floor and removed the white shirt putting on instead a striped convict shirt the warden had brought the warden took the white shirt eagerly and then and there compared the pieces of linen on which was written the cipher with certain torn places in the shirt the thinking machine looked on curiously the guard brought you those then he asked he certainly did replied the warden triumphantly and that ends your first attempt to escape the thinking machine watched the warden as he by comparison established to his own satisfaction that only two pieces of linen had been torn from the white shirt what did you write this with demanded the warden i should think it a part of your duty to find out said the thinking machine irritably the warden started to say some harsh things then restrained himself and made a minute search of the cell and of the prisoner instead he found absolutely nothing not even a match or toothpick which might have been used for a pen the same mystery surrounded the fluid with which the cipher had been written although the warden left cell visibly annoyed he took the torn shirt in triumph well writing notes on a shirt wont get him out thats certain he told himself with some complacency he put the linen scraps into his desk to await developments if that man escapes from that cell illhang itill resign on the third day of his incarceration the thinking machine openly attempted to bribe his way out the jailer had brought his dinner and was leaning against the barred door waiting when the thinking machine began the conversation the drainage pipes of the prison lead to the river dont they he asked yes said the jailer i suppose they are very small too small to crawl through if thats what youre thinking about was the grinning response there was silence until the thinking machine finished his meal then you know im not a criminal dont you yes and that ive a perfect right to be freed if i demand it yes well i came here believing that i could make my escape said the prisoner and his squint eyes studied the face of the jailer would you consider a financial reward for aiding me to escape the jailer who happened to be an honest man looked at the slender weak figure of the prisoner at the large head with its mass of yellow hair and was almost sorry i guess prisons like these were not built for the likes of you to get out of he said at last but would you consider a proposition to help me get out the prisoner insisted almost beseechingly no said the jailer shortly five hundred dollars urged the thinking machine i am not a criminal no said the jailer a thousand no again said the jailer and he started away hurriedly to escape further temptation then he turned back if you should give me ten thousand dollars i couldnt get you out youd have to pass through seven doors and i only have the keys to two then he told the warden all about it plan number two fails said the warden smiling grimly first a cipher then bribery when the jailer was on his way to cell at six oclock again bearing food to the thinking machine he paused startled by the unmistakable scrape scrape of steel against steel it stopped at the sound of his steps then craftily the jailer who was beyond the prisoners range of vision resumed his tramping the sound being apparently that of a man going away from cell as a matter of fact he was in the same spot after a moment there came again the steady scrape scrape and the jailer crept cautiously on tiptoes to the door and peered between the bars the thinking machine was standing on the iron bed working at the bars of the little window he was using a file judging from the backward and forward swing of his arms cautiously the jailer crept back to the office summoned the warden in person and they returned to cell on tiptoes the steady scrape was still audible the warden listened to satisfy himself and then suddenly appeared at the door well he demanded and there was a smile on his face the thinking machine glanced back from his perch on the bed and leaped suddenly to the floor making frantic efforts to hide something the warden went in with hand extended give it up he said no said the prisoner sharply come give it up urged the warden i dont want to have to search you again no repeated the prisoner what was it a file asked the warden the thinking machine was silent and stood squinting at the warden with something very nearly approaching disappointment on his facenearly but not quite the warden was almost sympathetic plan number three fails eh he asked goodnaturedly too bad isnt it the prisoner didnt say search him instructed the warden the jailer searched the prisoner carefully at last artfully concealed in the waistband of the trousers he found a piece of steel about two inches long with one side curved like a half moon ah said the warden as he received it from the jailer from your shoe heel and he smiled pleasantly the jailer continued his search and on the other side of the trousers waistband found another piece of steel identical with the first the edges showed where they had been worn against the bars of the window you couldnt saw a way through those bars with these said the warden i could have said the thinking machine firmly in six months perhaps said the warden goodnaturedly the warden shook his head slowly as he gazed into the slightly flushed face of his prisoner ready to give it up he asked i havent started yet was the prompt reply then came another exhaustive search of the cell carefully the two men went over it finally turning out the bed and searching that nothing the warden in person climbed upon the bed and examined the bars of the window where the prisoner had been sawing when he looked he was amused just made it a little bright by hard rubbing he said to the prisoner who stood looking on with a somewhat crestfallen air the warden grasped the iron bars in his strong hands and tried to shake them they were immovable set firmly in the solid granite he examined each in turn and found them all satisfactory finally he climbed down from the bed give it up professor he advised the thinking machine shook his head and the warden and jailer passed on again as they disappeared down the corridor the thinking machine sat on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands hes crazy to try to get out said the warden but hes clever i would like to know what he wrote that cipher with it was four oclock next morning when an awful heartracking shriek of terror resounded through the great prison it came from a cell somewhere about the centre and its tone told a tale of horror agony terrible fear the warden heard and with three of his men rushed into the long corridor leading to cell iv as they ran there came again that awful cry it died away in a sort of wail the white faces of prisoners appeared at cell doors upstairs and down staring out wonderingly frightened its that fool in cell grumbled the warden he stopped and stared in as one of the jailers flashed a lantern that fool in cell lay comfortably on his cot flat on his back with his mouth open snoring even as they looked there came again the piercing cry from somewhere above the wardens face blanched a little as he started up the stairs there on the top floor he found a man in cell directly above cell but two floors higher cowering in a corner of his cell whats the matter demanded the warden thank god youve come exclaimed the prisoner and he cast himself against the bars of his cell what is it demanded the warden again he threw open the door and went in the prisoner dropped on his knees and clasped the warden about the body his face was white with terror his eyes were widely distended and he was shuddering his hands icy cold clutched at the wardens take me out of this cell please take me out he pleaded whats the matter with you anyhow insisted the warden impatiently i heard somethingsomething said the prisoner and his eyes roved nervously around the cell what did you hear ii cant tell you stammered the prisoner then in a sudden burst of terror take me out of this cellput me anywherebut take me out of here the warden and three jailers exchanged glances who is this fellow whats he accused of asked the warden joseph ballard said one of the jailers hes accused of throwing acid in a womans face she died from it but they cant prove it gasped the prisoner they cant prove it please put me in some other cell he was still clinging to the warden and that official threw his arms off roughly then for a time he stood looking at the cowering wretch who seemed possessed of all the wild unreasoning terror of a child look here ballard said the warden finally if you heard anything i want to know what it was now tell me i cant i cant was the reply he was sobbing where did it come from i dont know everywherenowhere i just heard it what was ita voice please dont make me answer pleaded the prisoner you must answer said the warden sharply it was a voicebutbut it wasnt human was the sobbing reply voice but not human repeated the warden puzzled it sounded muffled andand far awayand ghostly explained the man did it come from inside or outside the prison it didnt seem to come from anywhereit was just here here everywhere i heard it i heard it for an hour the warden tried to get the story but ballard had become suddenly obstinate and would say nothingonly pleaded to be placed in another cell or to have one of the jailers remain near him until daylight these requests were gruffly refused and see here said the warden in conclusion if theres any more of this screaming ill put you in the padded cell then the warden went his way a sadly puzzled man ballard sat at his cell door until daylight his face drawn and white with terror pressed against the bars and looked out into the prison with wide staring eyes that day the fourth since the incarceration of the thinking machine was enlivened considerably by the volunteer prisoner who spent most of his time at the little window of his cell he began proceedings by throwing another piece of linen down to the guard who picked it up dutifully and took it to the warden on it was written only three days more the warden was in no way surprised at what he read he understood that the thinking machine meant only three days more of his imprisonment and he regarded the note as a boast but how was the thing written where had the thinking machine found this new piece of linen where how he carefully examined the linen it was white of fine texture shirting material he took the shirt which he had taken and carefully fitted the two original pieces of the linen to the torn places this third piece was entirely superfluous it didnt fit anywhere and yet it was unmistakably the same goods and wherewhere does he get anything to write with demanded the warden of the world at large still later on the fourth day the thinking machine through the window of his cell spoke to the armed guard outside what day of the month is it he asked the fifteenth was the answer the thinking machine made a mental astronomical calculation and satisfied himself that the moon would not rise until after nine oclock that night then he asked another question who attends to those arc lights man from the company you have no electricians in the building no i should think you could save money if you had your own man none of my business replied the guard the guard noticed the thinking machine at the cell window frequently during that day but always the face seemed listless and there was a certain wistfulness in the squint eyes behind the glasses after a while he accepted the presence of the leonine head as a matter of course he had seen other prisoners do the same thing it was the longing for the outside world that afternoon just before the day guard was relieved the head appeared at the window again and the thinking machines hand held something out between the bars it fluttered to the ground and the guard picked it up it was a fivedollar bill thats for you called the prisoner as usual the guard took it to the warden that gentleman looked at it suspiciously he looked at everything that came from cell with suspicion he said it was for me explained the guard its sort of a tip i suppose said the warden i see no particular reason why you shouldnt accept suddenly he stopped he had remembered that the thinking machine had gone into cell with one fivedollar bill and two tendollar bills twentyfive dollars in all now a fivedollar bill had been tied around the first pieces of linen that came from the cell the warden still had it and to convince himself he took it out and looked at it it was five dollars yet here was another five dollars and the thinking machine had only had tendollar bills perhaps somebody changed one of the bills for him he thought at last with a sigh of relief but then and there he made up his mind he would search cell as a cell was never before searched in this world when a man could write at will and change money and do other wholly inexplicable things there was something radically wrong with his prison he planned to enter the cell at nightthree oclock would be an excellent time the thinking machine must do all the weird things he did some time night seemed the most reasonable thus it happened that the warden stealthily descended upon cell that night at three oclock he paused at the door and listened there was no sound save the steady regular breathing of the prisoner the keys unfastened the double locks with scarcely a clank and the warden entered locking the door behind him suddenly he flashed his darklantern in the face of the recumbent figure if the warden had planed to startle the thinking machine he was mistaken for that individual merely opened his eyes quietly reached for his glasses and inquired in a most matteroffact tone who is it it would be useless to describe the search that the warden made it was minute not one inch of the cell or the bed was overlooked he found the round hole in the floor and with a flash of inspiration thrust his thick fingers into it after a moment of fumbling there he drew up something and looked at it in the light of his lantern ugh he exclaimed the thing he had taken out was a rata dead rat his inspiration fled as a mist before the sun but he continued the search the thinking machine without a word arose and kicked the rat out of the cell into the corridor the warden climbed on the bed and tried the steel bars in the tiny window they were perfectly rigid every bar of the door was the same then the warden searched the prisoners clothing beginning at the shoes nothing hidden in them then the trousers waistband still nothing then the pockets of the trousers from one side he drew out some paper money and examined it five onedollar bills he gasped thats right said the prisoner but theyou had two tens and a fivewhat thehow do you do it thats my business said the thinking machine did any of my men change this money for youon your word of honour the thinking machine paused just a fraction of a second no he said well do you make it asked the warden he was prepared to believe anything thats my business again said the prisoner the warden glared at the eminent scientist fiercely he felthe knewthat this man was making a fool of him yet he didnt know how if he were a real prisoner he would get the truthbut then perhaps those inexplicable things which had happened would not have been brought before him so sharply neither of the men spoke for a long time then suddenly the warden turned fiercely and left the cell slamming the door behind him he didnt care to speak then he glanced at the clock it was ten minutes to four he had hardly settled himself in bed when again came that heartbreaking shriek through the prison with a few muttered words which while not elegant were highly expressive he relighted his lantern and rushed through the prison again to the cell on the upper floor again ballard was crushing himself against the steel door shrieking shrieking at the top of his voice he stopped only when the warden flashed his lamp in the cell take me out take me out he screamed i did it i did it i killed her take it away take what away asked the warden i threw the acid in her facei did iti confess take me out of here ballards condition was pitiable it was only an act of mercy to let him out into the corridor there he crouched in a corner like an animal at bay and clasped his hands to his ears it took half an hour to calm him sufficiently for him to speak then he told incoherently what had happened on the night before at four oclock he had heard a voicea sepulchral voice muffled and wailing in tone what did it say asked the warden curiously acidacidacid gasped the prisoner it accused me acid i threw the acid and the woman died oh it was a long shuddering wail of terror acid echoed the warden puzzled the case was beyond him acid thats all i heardthat one word repeated several times there were other things too but i didnt hear them that was last night eh asked the warden what happened tonightwhat frightened you just now it was the same thing gasped the prisoner acidacidacid he covered his face with his hands and sat shivering it was acid i used on her but i didnt mean to kill her i just heard the words it was something accusing meaccusing me he mumbled and was silent did you hear anything else yesbut i couldnt understandonly a little bitjust a word or two well what was it i heard acid three times then i heard a long moaning sound thentheni heard no hat i heard that voice no hat repeated the warden what the devilno hat accusing voices of conscience have never talked about no hats so far as i ever heard hes insane said one of the jailers with an air of finality i believe you said the warden he must be he probably heard something and got frightened hes trembling now no hat what the v when the fifth day of the thinking machines imprisonment rolled around the warden was wearing a hunted look he was anxious for the end of the thing he could not help but feel that his distinguished prisoner had been amusing himself and if this were so the thinking machine had lost none of his sense of humour for on this fifth day he flung down another linen note to the outside guard bearing the words only two days more also he flung down half a dollar now the warden knewhe knewthat the man in cell didnt have any half dollarshe couldnt have any half dollars no more than he could have pen and ink and linen and yet he did have them it was a condition not a theory that is one reason why the warden was wearing a hunted look that ghastly uncanny thing too about acid and no hat clung to him tenaciously they didnt mean anything of course merely the ravings of an insane murderer who had been driven by fear to confess his crime still there were so many things that didnt mean anything happening in the prison now since the thinking machine was there on the sixth day the warden received a postal stating that dr ransome and mr fielding would be at chisholm prison on the following evening thursday and in the event professor van dusen had not yet escapedand they presumed he had not because they had not heard from himthey would meet him there in the event he had not yet escaped the warden smiled grimly escaped the thinking machine enlivened this day for the warden with three notes they were on the usual linen and bore generally on the appointment at halfpast eight oclock thursday night which appointment the scientist had made at the time of his imprisonment on the afternoon of the seventh day the warden passed cell and glanced in the thinking machine was lying on the iron bed apparently sleeping lightly the cell appeared precisely as it always did from a casual glance the warden would swear that no man was going to leave it between that hourit was then four oclockand halfpast eight oclock that evening on his way back past the cell the warden heard the steady breathing again and coming close to the door looked in he wouldnt have done so if the thinking machine had been looking but nowwell it was different a ray of light came through the high window and fell on the face of the sleeping man it occurred to the warden for the first time that his prisoner appeared haggard and weary just then the thinking machine stirred slightly and the warden hurried on up the corridor guiltily that evening after six oclock he saw the jailer everything all right in cell he asked yes sir replied the jailer he didnt eat much though it was with a feeling of having done his duty that the warden received dr ransome and mr fielding shortly after seven oclock he intended to show them the linen notes and lay before them the full story of his woes which was a long one but before this came to pass the guard from the river side of the prison yard entered the office the arc light in my side of the yard wont light he informed the warden confound it that mans a hoodoo thundered the official everything has happened since hes been here the guard went back to his post in the darkness and the warden phoned to the electric light company this is chisholm prison he said through the phone send three or four men down here quick to fix an arc light the reply was evidently satisfactory for the warden hung up the receiver and passed out into the yard while dr ransome and mr fielding sat waiting the guard at the outer gate came in with a special delivery letter dr ransome happened to notice the address and when the guard went out looked at the letter more closely by george he exclaimed what is it asked mr fielding silently the doctor offered the letter mr fielding examined it closely coincidence he said it must be it was nearly eight oclock when the warden returned to his office the electricians had arrived in a wagon and were now at work the warden pressed the buzzbutton communicating with the man at the outer gate in the wall how many electricians came in he asked over the short phone four three workmen in jumpers and overalls and the manager frock coat and silk hat all right be certain that only four go out thats all he turned to dr ransome and mr fielding we have to be careful hereparticularly and there was broad sarcasm in his tone since we have scientists locked up the warden picked up the special delivery letter carelessly and then began to open it when i read this i want to tell you gentlemen something about howgreat caesar he ended suddenly as he glanced at the letter he sat with mouth open motionless from astonishment what is it asked mr fielding a special delivery letter from cell gasped the warden an invitation to supper what and the two others arose unanimously the warden sat dazed staring at the letter for a moment then called sharply to a guard outside in the corridor run down to cell and see if that mans in there the guard went as directed while dr ransome and mr fielding examined the letter its van dusens handwriting theres no question of that said dr ransome ive seen too much of it just then the buzz on the telephone from the outer gate sounded and the warden in a semitrance picked up the receiver hello two reporters eh let em come in he turned suddenly to the doctor and mr fielding why the man cant be out he must be in his cell just at that moment the guard returned hes still in his cell sir he reported i saw him hes lying down there i told you so said the warden and he breathed freely again but how did he mail that letter there was a rap on the steel door which led from the jail yard into the wardens office its the reporters said the warden let them in he instructed the guard then to the two other gentlemen dont say anything about this before them because id never hear the last of it the door opened and the two men from the front gate entered goodevening gentlemen said one that was hutchinson hatch the warden knew him well well demanded the other irritably im here that was the thinking machine he squinted belligerently at the warden who sat with mouth agape for the moment that official had nothing to say dr ransome and mr fielding were amazed but they didnt know what the warden knew they were only amazed he was paralyzed hutchinson hatch the reporter took in the scene with greedy eyes howhowhow did you do it gasped the warden finally come back to the cell said the thinking machine in the irritated voice which his scientific associates knew so well the warden still in a condition bordering on trance led the way flash your light in there directed the thinking machine the warden did so there was nothing unusual in the appearance of the cell and therethere on the bed lay the figure of the thinking machine certainly there was the yellow hair again the warden looked at the man beside him and wondered at the strangeness of his own dreams with trembling hands he unlocked the cell door and the thinking machine passed inside see here he said he kicked at the steel bars in the bottom of the cell door and three of them were pushed out of place a fourth broke off and rolled away in the corridor and here too directed the erstwhile prisoner as he stood on the bed to reach the small window he swept his hand across the opening and every bar came out whats this in the bed demanded the warden who was slowly recovering a wig was the reply turn down the cover the warden did so beneath it lay a large coil of strong rope thirty feet or more a dagger three files ten feet of electric wire a thin powerful pair of steel pliers a small tack hammer with its handle andand a derringer pistol how did you do it demanded the warden you gentlemen have an engagement to supper with me at halfpast nine oclock said the thinking machine come on or we shall be late but how did you do it insisted the warden dont ever think you can hold any man who can use his brain said the thinking machine come on we shall be late vi it was an impatient supper party in the rooms of professor van dusen and a somewhat silent one the guests were dr ransome albert fielding the warden and hutchinson hatch reporter the meal was served to the minute in accordance with professor van dusens instructions of one week before dr ransome found the artichokes delicious at last the supper was finished and the thinking machine turned full on dr ransome and squinted at him fiercely do you believe it now he demanded i do replied dr ransome do you admit that it was a fair test i do with the others particularly the warden he was waiting anxiously for the explanation suppose you tell us how began mr fielding yes tell us how said the warden the thinking machine readjusted his glasses took a couple of preparatory squints at his audience and began the story he told it from the beginning logically and no man ever talked to more interested listeners my agreement was he began to go into a cell carrying nothing except what was necessary to wear and to leave that cell within a week i had never seen chisholm prison when i went into the cell i asked for tooth powder two ten and one fivedollar bills and also to have my shoes blacked even if these requests had been refused it would not have mattered seriously but you agreed to them i knew there would be nothing in the cell which you thought i might use to advantage so when the warden locked the door on me i was apparently helpless unless i could turn three seemingly innocent things to use they were things which would have been permitted any prisoner under sentence of death were they not warden tooth powder and polished shoes yes but not money replied the warden anything is dangerous in the hands of a man who knows how to use it went on the thinking machine i did nothing that first night but sleep and chase rats he glared at the warden when the matter was broached i knew i could do nothing that night so suggested next day you gentlemen thought i wanted time to arrange an escape with outside assistance but this was not true i knew i could communicate with whom i pleased when i pleased the warden stared at him a moment then went on smoking solemnly i was aroused next morning at six oclock by the jailer with my breakfast continued the scientist he told me dinner was at twelve and supper at six between these times i gathered i would be pretty much to myself so immediately after breakfast i examined my outside surroundings from my cell window one look told me it would be useless to try to scale the wall even should i decide to leave my cell by the window for my purpose was to leave not only the cell but the prison of course i could have gone over the wall but it would have taken me longer to lay my plans that way therefore for the moment i dismissed all idea of that from this first observation i knew the river was on that side of the prison and that there was also a playground there subsequently these surmises were verified by a keeper i knew then one important thingthat any one might approach the prison wall from that side if necessary without attracting any particular attention that was well to remember i remembered it but the outside thing which most attracted my attention was the feed wire to the arc light which ran within a few feetprobably three or fourof my cell window i knew that would be valuable in the event i found it necessary to cut off that arc light oh you shut it off tonight then asked the warden having learned all i could from that window resumed the thinking machine without heeding the interruption i considered the idea of escaping through the prison proper i recalled just how i had come into the cell which i knew would be the only way seven doors lay between me and the outside so also for the time being i gave up the idea of escaping that way and i couldnt go through the solid granite walls of the cell the thinking machine paused for a moment and dr ransome lighted a new cigar for several minutes there was silence then the scientific jailbreaker went on while i was thinking about these things a rat ran across my foot it suggested a new line of thought there were at least half a dozen rats in the celli could see their beady eyes yet i had noticed none come under the cell door i frightened them purposely and watched the cell door to see if they went out that way they did not but they were gone obviously they went another way another way meant another opening i searched for this opening and found it it was an old drain pipe long unused and partly choked with dirt and dust but this was the way the rats had come they came from somewhere where drain pipes usually lead outside prison grounds this one probably led to the river or near it the rats must therefore come from that direction if they came a part of the way i reasoned that they came all the way because it was extremely unlikely that a solid iron or lead pipe would have any hole in it except at the exit when the jailer came with my luncheon he told me two important things although he didnt know it one was that a new system of plumbing had been put in the prison seven years before another that the river was only three hundred feet away then i knew positively that the pipe was a part of an old system i knew too that it slanted generally toward the river but did the pipe end in the water or on land this was the next question to be decided i decided it by catching several of the rats in the cell my jailer was surprised to see me engaged in this work i examined at least a dozen of them they were perfectly dry they had come through the pipe and most important of all they were not house rats but field rats the other end of the pipe was on land then outside the prison walls so far so good then i knew that if i worked freely from this point i must attract the wardens attention in another direction you see by telling the warden that i had come here to escape you made the test more severe because i had to trick him by false scents the warden looked up with a sad expression in his eyes the first thing was to make him think i was trying to communicate with you dr ransome so i wrote a note on a piece of linen i tore from my shirt addressed it to dr ransome tied a fivedollar bill around it and threw it out the window i knew the guard would take it to the warden but i rather hoped the warden would send it as addressed have you that first linen note warden the warden produced the cipher what the deuce does it mean anyhow he asked read it backward beginning with the t signature and disregard the division into words instructed the thinking machine the warden did so this this he spelled studied it a moment then read it off grinning this is not the way i intend to escape well now what do you think o that he demanded still grinning i knew that would attract your attention just as it did said the thinking machine and if you really found out what it was it would be a sort of gentle rebuke what did you write it with asked dr ransome after he had examined the linen and passed it to mr fielding this said the erstwhile prisoner and he extended his foot on it was the shoe he had worn in prison though the polish was gonescraped off clean the shoe blacking moistened with water was my ink the metal tip of the shoe lace made a fairly good pen the warden looked up and suddenly burst into a laugh half of relief half of amusement youre a wonder he said admiringly go on that precipitated a search of my cell by the warden as i had intended continued the thinking machine i was anxious to get the warden into the habit of searching my cell so that finally constantly finding nothing he would get disgusted and quit this at last happened practically the warden blushed he then took my white shirt away and gave me a prison shirt he was satisfied that those two pieces of the shirt were all that was missing but while he was searching my cell i had another piece of that same shirt about nine inches square rolled into a small ball in my mouth nine inches of that shirt demanded the warden where did it come from the bosoms of all stiff white shirts are of triple thickness was the explanation i tore out the inside thickness leaving the bosom only two thicknesses i knew you wouldnt see it so much for that there was a little pause and the warden looked from one to another of the men with a sheepish grin having disposed of the warden for the time being by giving him something else to think about i took my first serious step toward freedom said professor van dusen i knew within reason that the pipe led somewhere to the playground outside i knew a great many boys played there i knew that rats came into my cell from out there could i communicate with some one outside with these things at hand first was necessary i saw a long and fairly reliable thread sbut here he pulled up his trousers legs and showed that the tops of both stockings of fine strong lisle were gone i unravelled thoseafter i got them started it wasnt difficultand i had easily a quarter of a mile of thread that i could depend on then on half of my remaining linen i wrote laboriously enough i assure you a letter explaining my situation to this gentleman here and he indicated hutchinson hatch i knew he would assist mefor the value of the newspaper story i tied firmly to this linen letter a tendollar billthere is no surer way of attracting the eye of any oneand wrote on the linen finder of this deliver to hutchinson hatch daily american who will give another ten dollars for the information the next thing was to get this note outside on the playground where a boy might find it there were two ways but i chose the best i took one of the ratsi became adept in catching themtied the linen and money firmly to one leg fastened my lisle thread to another and turned him loose in the drain pipe i reasoned that the natural fright of the rodent would make him run until he was outside the pipe and then out on earth he would probably stop to gnaw off the linen and money from the moment the rat disappeared into that dusty pipe i became anxious i was taking so many chances the rat might gnaw the string of which i held one end other rats might gnaw it the rat might run out of the pipe and leave the linen and money where they would never be found a thousand other things might have happened so began some nervous hours but the fact that the rat ran on until only a few feet of the string remained in my cell made me think he was outside the pipe i had carefully instructed mr hatch what to do in case the note reached him the question was would it reach him this done i could only wait and make other plans in case this one failed i openly attempted to bribe my jailer and learned from him that he held the keys to only two of seven doors between me and freedom then i did something else to make the warden nervous i took the steel supports out of the heels of my shoes and made a pretense of sawing the bars of my cell window the warden raised a pretty row about that he developed too the habit of shaking the bars of my cell window to see if they were solid they werethen again the warden grinned he had ceased being astonished with this one plan i had done all i could and could only wait to see what happened the scientist went on i couldnt know whether my note had been delivered or even found or whether the rat had gnawed it up and i didnt dare to draw back through the pipe that one slender thread which connected me with the outside when i went to bed that night i didnt sleep for fear there would come the slight signal twitch at the thread which was to tell me that mr hatch had received the note at halfpast three oclock i judge i felt this twitch and no prisoner actually under sentence of death ever welcomed a thing more heartily the thinking machine stopped and turned to the reporter youd better explain just what you did he said the linen note was brought to me by a small boy who had been playing baseball said mr hatch i immediately saw a big story in it so i gave the boy another ten dollars and got several spools of silk some twine and a roll of light pliable wire the professors note suggested that i have the finder of the note show me just where it was picked up and told me to make my search from there beginning at two oclock in the morning if i found the other end of the thread i was to twitch it gently three times then a fourth i began to search with a small bulb electric light it was an hour and twenty minutes before i found the end of the drain pipe half hidden in weeds the pipe was very large there say twelve inches across then i found the end of the lisle thread twitched it as directed and immediately i got an answering twitch then i fastened the silk to this and professor van dusen began to pull it into his cell i nearly had heart disease for fear the string would break to the end of the silk i fastened the twine and when that had been pulled in i tied on the wire then that was drawn into the pipe and we had a substantial line which the rats couldnt gnaw from the mouth of the drain into the cell the thinking machine raised his hand and hatch stopped all this was done in absolute silence said the scientist but when the wire reached my hand i could have shouted then we tried another experiment which mr hatch was prepared for i tested the pipe as a speaking tube neither of us could hear very clearly but i dared not speak loud for fear of attracting attention in the prison at last i made him understand what i wanted immediately he seemed to have great difficulty in understanding when i asked for nitric acid and i repeated the word acid several times then i heard a shriek from a cell above me i knew instantly that some one had overheard and when i heard you coming mr warden i feigned sleep if you had entered my cell at that moment that whole plan of escape would have ended there but you passed on that was the nearest i ever came to being caught having established this improvised trolley it is easy to see how i got things in the cell and made them disappear at will i merely dropped them back into the pipe you mr warden could not have reached the connecting wire with your fingers they are too large my fingers you see are longer and more slender in addition i guarded the top of that pipe with a ratyou remember how i remember said the warden with a grimace i thought that if any one were tempted to investigate that hole the rat would dampen his ardour mr hatch could not send me anything useful through the pipe until next night although he did send me change for ten dollars as a test so i proceeded with other parts of my plan then i evolved the method of escape which i finally employed in order to carry this out successfully it was necessary for the guard in the yard to get accustomed to seeing me at the cell window i arranged this by dropping linen notes to him boastful in tone to make the warden believe if possible one of his assistants was communicating with the outside for me i would stand at my window for hours gazing out so the guard could see and occasionally i spoke to him in that way i learned that the prison had no electricians of its own but was dependent upon the lighting company if anything should go wrong that cleared the way to freedom perfectly early in the evening of the last day of my imprisonment when it was dark i planned to cut the feed wire which was only a few feet from my window reaching it with an acidtipped wire i had that would make that side of the prison perfectly dark while the electricians were searching for the break that would also bring mr hatch into the prison yard there was only one more thing to do before i actually began the work of setting myself free this was to arrange final details with mr hatch through our speaking tube i did this within half an hour after the warden left my cell on the fourth night of my imprisonment mr hatch again had serious difficulty in understanding me and i repeated the word acid to him several times and later the words number eight hatthats my sizeand these were the things which made a prisoner upstairs confess to murder so one of the jailers told me next day this prisoner heard our voices confused of course through the pipe which also went to his cell the cell directly over me was not occupied hence no one else heard of course the actual work of cutting the steel bars out of the window and door was comparatively easy with nitric acid which i got through the pipe in thin bottles but it took time hour after hour on the fifth and sixth and seventh days the guard below was looking at me as i worked on the bars of the window with the acid on a piece of wire i used the tooth powder to prevent the acid spreading i looked away abstractly as i worked and each minute the acid cut deeper into the metal i noticed that the jailers always tried the door by shaking the upper part never the lower bars therefore i cut the lower bars leaving them hanging in place by thin strips of metal but that was a bit of daredeviltry i could not have gone that way so easily the thinking machine sat silent for several minutes i think that makes everything clear he went on whatever points i have not explained were merely to confuse the warden and jailers these things in my bed i brought in to please mr hatch who wanted to improve the story of course the wig was necessary in my plan the special delivery letter i wrote and directed in my cell with mr hatchs fountain pen then sent it out to him and he mailed it thats all i think but your actually leaving the prison grounds and then coming in through the outer gate to my office asked the warden perfectly simple said the scientist i cut the electric light wire with acid as i said when the current was off therefore when the current was turned on the arc didnt light i knew it would take some time to find out what was the matter and make repairs when the guard went to report to you the yard was dark i crept out the windowit was a tight fit tooreplaced the bars by standing on a narrow ledge and remained in a shadow until the force of electricians arrived mr hatch was one of them when i saw him i spoke and he handed me a cap a jumper and overalls which i put on within ten feet of you mr warden while you were in the yard later mr hatch called me presumably as a workman and together we went out the gate to get something out of the wagon the gate guard let us pass out readily as two workmen who had just passed in we changed our clothing and reappeared asking to see you we saw you thats all there was silence for several minutes dr ransome was first to speak wonderful he exclaimed perfectly amazing how did mr hatch happen to come with the electricians asked mr fielding his father is manager of the company replied the thinking machine but what if there had been no mr hatch outside to help every prisoner has one friend outside who would help him escape if he could supposejust supposethere had been no old plumbing system there asked the warden curiously there were two other ways out said the thinking machine enigmatically ten minutes later the telephone bell rang it was a request for the warden light all right eh the warden asked through the phone good wire cut beside cell yes i know one electrician too many whats that two came out the warden turned to the others with a puzzled expression he only let in four electricians he has let out two and says there are three left i was the odd one said the thinking machine oh said the warden i see then through the phone let the fifth man go hes all right melville davisson post melville davisson posts two series characters who earned their author wide popular acclaim in his day are a study in contrasts the

ventured into paris with monsieur jonquelle prefect of police of paris and returned to the virginia hills with his gentleman lawyer colonel braxton loaded with biblical allusions and quotations the doomdorf mystery exemplifies the abner stories the final line is an abner classic the doomdorf mystery the pioneer was not the only man in the great mountains behind virginia strange aliens drifted in after the colonial wars all foreign armies are sprinkled with a cockle of adventurers that take root and remain they were with braddock and la salle and they rode north out of mexico after her many empires went to pieces i think doomdorf crossed the seas with iturbide when that illstarred adventurer returned to be shot against a wall but there was no southern blood in him he came from some european race remote and barbaric the evidences were all about him he was a huge figure of a man with a black spade beard broad thick hands and square flat fingers he had found a wedge of land between the crowns grant to daniel davisson and a washington survey it was an uncovered triangle not worth the running of the lines and so no doubt was left out a sheer rock standing up out of the river for a base and a peak of the mountain rising northward behind it for an apex doomdorf squatted on the rock he must have brought a belt of gold pieces when he took to his horse for he hired old robert steuarts slaves and built a stone house on the rock and he brought the furnishings overland from a frigate in the chesapeake and then in the handfuls of earth wherever a root would hold he planted the mountain behind his house with peach trees the gold gave out but the devil is fertile in resources doomdorf built a log still and turned the first fruits of the garden into a hellbrew the idle and the vicious came with their stone jugs and violence and riot flowed out the government of virginia was remote and its arm short and feeble but the men who held the lands west of the mountains against the savages under grants from george and after that held them against george himself were efficient and expeditious they had long patience but when that failed they went up from their fields and drove the thing before them out of the land like a scourge of god there came a day then when my uncle abner and squire randolph rode through the gap of the mountains to have the thing out with doomdorf the work of this brew which had the odours of eden and the impulses of the devil in it could be borne no longer the drunken negroes had shot old duncans cattle and burned his haystacks and the land was on its feet they rode alone but they were worth an army of little men randolph was vain and pompous and given over to extravagance of words but he was a gentleman beneath it and fear was an alien and a stranger to him and abner was the right hand of the land it was a day in early summer and the sun lay hot they crossed through the broken spine of the mountains and trailed along the river in the shade of the great chestnut trees the road was only a path and the horses went one before the other it left the river when the rock began to rise and making a detour through the grove of peach trees reached the house on the mountain side randolph and abner got down unsaddled their horses and turned them out to graze for their business with doomdorf would not be over in an hour then they took a steep path that brought them out on the mountain side of the house a man sat on a big redroan horse in the paved court before the door he was a gaunt old man he sat bareheaded the palms of his hands resting on the pommel of his saddle his chin sunk in his black stock his face in retrospection the wind moving gently his great shock of voluminous white hair under him the huge red horse stood with his legs spread out like a horse of stone there was no sound the door to the house was closed insects moved in the sun a shadow crept out from the motionless figure and swarms of yellow butterflies manoeuvred like an army abner and randolph stopped they knew the tragic figurea circuit rider of the hills who preached the invective of isaiah as though he were the mouthpiece of a militant and avenging overlord as though the government of virginia were the awful theocracy of the book of kings the horse was dripping with sweat and the man bore the dust and the evidences of a journey on him bronson said abner where is doomdorf the old man lifted his head and looked down at abner over the pommel of the saddle surely he said he covereth his feet in his summer chamber abner went over and knocked on the closed door and presently the white frightened face of a woman looked out at him she was a little faded woman with fair hair a broad foreign face but with the delicate evidences of gentle blood abner repeated his question where is doomdorf oh sir she answered with a queer lisping accent he went to lie down in his south room after his midday meal as his custom is and i went to the orchard to gather any fruit that might be ripened she hesitated and her voice lisped into a whisper he is not come out and i cannot wake him the two men followed her through the hall and up the stairway to the door it is always bolted she said when he goes to lie down and she knocked feebly with the tips of her fingers there was no answer and randolph rattled the doorknob come out doomdorf he called in his big bellowing voice there was only silence and the echoes of the words among the rafters then randolph set his shoulder to the door and burst it open they went in the room was flooded with sun from the tall south windows doomdorf lay on a couch in a little offset of the room a great scarlet patch on his bosom and a pool of scarlet on the floor the woman stood for a moment staring then she cried out at last i have killed him and she ran like a frightened hare the two men closed the door and went over to the couch doomdorf had been shot to death there was a great ragged hole in his waistcoat they began to look about for the weapon with which the deed had been accomplished and in a moment found ita fowling piece lying in two dogwood forks against the wall the gun had just been fired there was a freshly exploded paper cap under the hammer there was little else in the rooma loomwoven rag carpet on the floor wooden shutters flung back from the windows a great oak table and on it a big round glass water bottle filled to its glass stopper with raw liquor from the still the stuff was limpid and clear as spring water and but for its pungent odour one would have taken it for gods brew instead of doomdorfs the sun lay on it and against the wall where hung the weapon that had ejected the dead man out of life abner said randolph this is murder the woman took that gun down from the wall and shot doomdorf while he slept abner was standing by the table his fingers round his chin randolph he replied what brought bronson here the same outrages that brought us said randolph the mad old circuit rider has been preaching a crusade against doomdorf far and wide in the hills abner answered without taking his fingers from about his chin you think this woman killed doomdorf well let us go and ask bronson who killed him they closed the door leaving the dead man on his couch and went down into the court the old circuit rider had put away his horse and got an ax he had taken off his coat and pushed his shirtsleeves up over his long elbows he was on his way to the still to destroy the barrels of liquor he stopped when the two men came out and abner called to him bronson he said who killed doomdorf i killed him replied the old man and went on toward the still randolph swore under his breath by the almighty he said everybody couldnt kill him who can tell how many had a hand in it replied abner two have confessed cried randolph was there perhaps a third did you kill him abner and i too man the thing is impossible the impossible replied abner looks here like the truth come with me randolph and i will show you a thing more impossible than this they returned through the house and up the stairs to the room abner closed the door behind them look at this bolt he said it is on the inside and not connected with the lock how did the one who killed doomdorf get into this room since the door was bolted through the windows replied randolph there were but two windows facing the south through which the sun entered abner led randolph to them look he said the wall of the house is plumb with the sheer face of the rock it is a hundred feet to the river and the rock is as smooth as a sheet of glass but that is not all look at these window frames they are cemented into their casement with dust and they are bound along their edges with cobwebs these windows have not been opened how did the assassin enter the answer is evident said randolph the one who killed doomdorf hid in the room until he was asleep then he shot him and went out the explanation is excellent but for one thing replied abner how did the assassin bolt the door behind him on the inside of this room after he had gone out randolph flung out his arms with a hopeless gesture who knows he cried maybe doomdorf killed himself abner laughed and after firing a handful of shot into his heart he got up and put the gun back carefully into the forks against the wall well cried randolph there is one open road out of this mystery bronson and this woman say they killed doomdorf and if they killed him they surely know how they did it let us go down and ask them in the law court replied abner that procedure would be considered sound sense but we are in gods court and things are managed there in a somewhat stranger way before we go let us find out if we can at what hour it was that doomdorf died he went over and took a big silver watch out of the dead mans pocket it was broken by a shot and the hands lay at one hour after noon he stood for a moment fingering his chin at one oclock he said bronson i think was on the road to this place and the woman was on the mountain among the peach trees randolph threw back his shoulders why waste time in a speculation about it abner he said we know who did this thing let us go and get the story of it out of their own mouths doomdorf died by the hands of either bronson or this woman i could better believe it replied abner but for the running of a certain awful law what law said randolph is it a statute of virginia it is a statute replied abner of an authority somewhat higher mark the language of it he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword he came over and took randolph by the arm must randolph did you mark particularly the word must it is a mandatory law there is no room in it for the vicissitudes of chance or fortune there is no way round that word thus we reap what we sow and nothing else thus we receive what we give and nothing else it is the weapon in our own hands that finally destroys us you are looking at it now and he turned him about so that the table and the weapon and the dead man were before him he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword and now he said let us go and try the method of the law courts your faith is in the wisdom of their ways they found the old circuit rider at work in the still staving in doomdorfs liquor casks splitting the oak heads with his ax bronson said randolph how did you kill doomdorf the old man stopped and stood leaning on his ax i killed him replied the old man as elijah killed the captains of ahaziah and their fifties but not by the hand of any man did i pray the lord god to destroy doomdorf but with fire from heaven to destroy him he stood up and extended his arms his hands were full of blood he said with his abomination from these groves of baal he stirred up the people to contention to strife and murder the widow and the orphan cried to heaven against him i will surely hear their cry is the promise written in the book the land was weary of him and i prayed the lord god to destroy him with fire from heaven as he destroyed the princes of gomorrah in their palaces randolph made a gesture as of one who dismisses the impossible but abners face took on a deep strange look with fire from heaven he repeated slowly to himself then he asked a question a little while ago he said when we came i asked you where doomdorf was and you answered me in the language of the third chapter of the book of judges why did you answer me like that bronsonsurely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber the woman told me that he had not come down from the room where he had gone up to sleep replied the old man and that the door was locked and then i knew that he was dead in his summer chamber like eglon king of moab he extended his arm toward the south i came here from the great valley he said to cut down these groves of baal and to empty out this abomination but i did not know that the lord had heard my prayer and visited his wrath on doomdorf until i was come up into these mountains to his door when the woman spoke i knew it and he went away to his horse leaving the ax among the ruined barrels randolph interrupted come abner he said this is wasted time bronson did not kill doomdorf abner answered slowly in his deep level voice do you realise randolph how doomdorf died not by fire from heaven at any rate said randolph randolph replied abner are you sure abner cried randolph you are pleased to jest but i am in deadly earnest a crime has been done here against the state i am an officer of justice and i propose to discover the assassin if i can he walked away toward the house and abner followed his hands behind him and his great shoulders thrown loosely forward with a grim smile about his mouth it is no use to talk with the mad old preacher randolph went on let him empty out the liquor and ride away i wont issue a warrant against him prayer may be a handy implement to do a murder with abner but it is not a deadly weapon under the statutes of virginia doomdorf was dead when old bronson got here with his scriptural jargon this woman killed doomdorf i shall put her to an inquisition as you like replied abner your faith remains in the methods of the law courts do you know of any better methods said randolph perhaps replied abner when you have finished night had entered the valley the two men went into the house and set about preparing the corpse for burial they got candles and made a coffin and put doomdorf in it and straightened out his limbs and folded his arms across his shotout heart then they set the coffin on benches in the hall they kindled a fire in the dining room and sat down before it with the door open and the red firelight shining through on the dead mans narrow everlasting house the woman had put some cold meat a golden cheese and a loaf on the table they did not see her but they heard her moving about the house and finally on the gravel court outside her step and the whinny of a horse then she came in dressed as for a journey randolph sprang up where are you going he said to the sea and a ship replied the woman then she indicated the hall with a gesture he is dead and i am free there was a sudden illumination in her face randolph took a step toward her his voice was big and harsh who killed doomdorf he cried i killed him replied the woman it was fair fair echoed the justice what do you mean by that the woman shrugged her shoulders and put out her hands with a foreign gesture i remember an old old man sitting against a sunny wall and a little girl and one who came and talked a long time with the old man while the little girl plucked yellow flowers out of the grass and put them into her hair then finally the stranger gave the old man a gold chain and took the little girl away she flung out her hands oh it was fair to kill him she looked up with a queer pathetic smile the old man will be gone by now she said but i shall perhaps find the wall there with the sun on it and the yellow flowers in the grass and now may i go it is a law of the storytellers art that he does not tell a story it is the listener who tells it the storyteller does but provide him with the stimuli randolph got up and walked about the floor he was a justice of the peace in a day when that office was filled only by the landed gentry after the english fashion and the obligations of the law were strong on him if he should take liberties with the letter of it how could the weak and the evil be made to hold it in respect here was this woman before him a confessed assassin could he let her go abner sat unmoving by the hearth his elbow on the arm of his chair his palm propping up his jaw his face clouded in deep lines randolph was consumed with vanity and the weakness of ostentation but he shouldered his duties for himself presently he stopped and looked at the woman wan faded like some prisoner of legend escaped out of fabled dungeons into the sun the firelight flickered past her to the box on the benches in the hall and the vast inscrutable justice of heaven entered and overcame him yes he said go there is no jury in virginia that would hold a woman for shooting a beast like that and he thrust out his arm with the fingers extended toward the dead man the woman made a little awkward curtsy i thank you sir then she hesitated and lisped but i have not shoot him not shoot him cried randolph why the mans heart is riddled yes sir she said simply like a child i kill him but have not shoot him randolph took two long strides toward the woman not shoot him he repeated how then in the name of heaven did you kill doomdorf and his big voice filled the empty places of the room i will show you sir she said she turned and went away into the house presently she returned with something folded up in a linen towel she put it on the table between the loaf of bread and the yellow cheese randolph stood over the table and the womans deft fingers undid the towel from round its deadly contents and presently the thing lay there uncovered it was a little crude model of a human figure done in wax with a needle thrust through the bosom randolph stood up with a great intake of the breath magic by the eternal yes sir the woman explained in her voice and manner of a child i have try to kill him many timesoh very many timeswith witch words which i have remember but always they fail then at last i make him in wax and i put a needle through his heart and i kill him very quickly it was as clear as daylight even to randolph that the woman was innocent her little harmless magic was the pathetic effort of a child to kill a dragon he hesitated a moment before he spoke and then he decided like the gentleman he was if it helped the child to believe that her enchanted straw had slain the monsterwell he would let her believe it and now sir may i go randolph looked at the woman in a sort of wonder are you not afraid he said of the night and the mountains and the long road oh no sir she replied simply the good god will be everywhere now it was an awful commentary on the dead manthat this strange halfchild believed that all the evil in the world had gone out with him that now that he was dead the sunlight of heaven would fill every nook and corner it was not a faith that either of the two men wished to shatter and they let her go it would be daylight presently and the road through the mountains to the chesapeake was open randolph came back to the fireside after he had helped her into the saddle and sat down he tapped on the hearth for some time idly with the iron poker and then finally he spoke this is the strangest thing that ever happened he said heres a mad old preacher who thinks that he killed doomdorf with fire from heaven like elijah the tishbite and here is a simple child of a woman who thinks she killed him with a piece of magic of the middle ageseach as innocent of his death as i am and yet by the eternal the beast is dead he drummed on the hearth with the poker lifting it up and letting it drop through the hollow of his fingers somebody shot doomdorf but who and how did he get into and out of that shutup room the assassin that killed doomdorf must have gotten into the room to kill him now how did he get in he spoke as to himself but my uncle sitting across the hearth replied through the window through the window echoed randolph why man you yourself showed me that the window had not been opened and the precipice below it a fly could hardly climb do you tell me now that the window was opened no said abner it was never opened randolph got on his feet abner he cried are you saying that the one who killed doomdorf climbed the sheer wall and got in through a closed window without disturbing the dust or the cobwebs on the window frame my uncle looked randolph in the face the murderer of doomdorf did even more he said that assassin not only climbed the face of that precipice and got in through the closed window but he shot doomdorf to death and got out again through the closed window without leaving a single track or trace behind and without disturbing a grain of dust or a thread of a cobweb randolph swore a great oath the thing is impossible he cried men are not killed today in virginia by black art or a curse of god by black art no replied abner but by the curse of god yes i think they are randolph drove his clenched right hand into the palm of his left by the eternal he cried i would like to see the assassin who could do a murder like this whether he be an imp from the pit or an angel out of heaven very well replied abner undisturbed when he comes back tomorrow i will show you the assassin who killed doomdorf when day broke they dug a grave and buried the dead man against the mountain among his peach trees it was noon when that work was ended abner threw down his spade and looked up at the sun randolph he said let us go and lay an ambush for this assassin he is on the way here and it was a strange ambush that he laid when they were come again into the chamber where doomdorf died he bolted the door then he loaded the fowling piece and put it carefully back on its rack against the wall after that he did another curious thing he took the bloodstained coat which they had stripped off the dead man when they had prepared his body for the earth put a pillow in it and laid it on the couch precisely where doomdorf had slept and while he did these things randolph stood in wonder and abner talked look you randolph we will trick the murderer we will catch him in the act then he went over and took the puzzled justice by the arm watch he said the assassin is coming along the wall but randolph heard nothing saw nothing only the sun entered abners hand tightened on his arm it is here look and he pointed to the wall randolph following the extended finger saw a tiny brilliant disk of light moving slowly up the wall toward the lock of the fowling piece abners hand became a vise and his voice rang as over metal he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword it is the water bottle full of doomdorfs liquor focusing the sun and look randolph how bronsons prayer was answered the tiny disk of light travelled on the plate of the lock it is fire from heaven the words rang above the roar of the fowling piece and randolph saw the dead mans coat leap up on the couch riddled by the shot the gun in its natural position on the rack pointed to the couch standing at the end of the chamber beyond the offset of the wall and the focused sun had exploded the percussion cap randolph made a great gesture with his arm extended it is a world he said filled with the mysterious joinder of accident it is a world replied abner filled with the mysterious justice of god anna katharine green often referred to as the mother of detective fiction anna katharine green deserves her distinction her accomplishments included the establishment and refining of many of the conventions of the genre that we now take for granted andalong with depicting a male police detectivethe creation of two of the earliest women sleuths in fiction a contemporary of sir arthur conan doyle this new yorker produced both police procedurals and privateinvestigator fiction the heart of greens literary career which provided the main support for her family spanned two decades on each side of the turn of the century while conan doyle was developing the civilian sleuth green wrote one of the first authentic police procedurals the leavenworth case a lawyers story in in this hugely successful first novel she followed the work of new york city police detective ebenezer gryce it might be noted that gryces reasoning is sometimes dubious for example he clears a niece of suspicion when he sees lint from a cleaning cloth on the cylinder of the murder weapon a woman he declares would fire a pistol but never clean it the leavenworth case is said to be the first detective novel written by a woman under her own name it is notable not only for the sleuths reliance on reason to solve the case but also for pointing out the problems inherent in undue reliance on circumstantial evidence the yale law school assigned it as required reading and it sold a million copies in greens day gryce appeared in more than a dozen novels often in the company of other series characters including the sometimes rivalrous caleb sweetwater and the spinstersleuth amelia butterworth this last a middleage uppermiddleclass middlebrow detective is a prototype for agatha christies miss jane marple and other female amateur investigators of the golden age of detective fiction violet strange who appears in missing page thirteen is less staunch than butterworth but more determined to make a paying career of the detective business she pursues her work in order to pay for her widowed sisters voice lessons an enterprise so frowned upon by their father that he has disowned stranges sister in order to avoid a similar fate strange keeps her sleuthing secret an active social life provides her with entree into households where family wealth walks hand in hand with family secrets where the atmosphere is gothic and where intuition guides her interpretation of evidence acquired through earnestand sometimes courageousresourcefulness as do greens novels this tale illuminates social conventions oppressive to women missing page thirteen i one more just one more well paying affair and i promise to stop really and truly to stop but puss why one more you have earned the amount you set for yourselfor very nearlyand though my help is not great in three months i can add enough no you cannot arthur you are doing well i appreciate it in fact i am just delighted to have you work for me in the way you do but you cannot in your present position make enough in three months or in six to meet the situation as i see it enough does not satisfy me the measure must be full heaped up and running over possible failure following promise must be provided for never must i feel myself called upon to do this kind of thing again besides i have never got over the zabriskie tragedy it haunts me continually something new may help to put it out of my head i feel guilty i was responsible no puss i will not have it that you were responsible some such end was bound to follow a complication like that sooner or later he would have been driven to shoot himself but not her no not her but do you think she would have given those few minutes of perfect understanding with her blind husband for a few years more of miserable life violet made no answer she was too absorbed in her surprise was this arthur had a few weeks work and a close connection with the really serious things of life made this change in him her face beamed at the thought which seeing but not understanding what underlay this evidence of joy he bent and kissed her saying with some of his old nonchalance forget it violet only dont let any one or anything lead you to interest yourself in another affair of the kind if you do i shall have to consult a certain friend of yours as to the best way of stopping this folly i mention no names oh you need not look so frightened only behave thats all hes right she acknowledged to herself as he sauntered away altogether right yet because she wanted the extra money the scene invited alarmthat is for so young a girl as violet surveying it from an automobile some time after the stroke of midnight an unknown house at the end of a heavily shaded walk in the open doorway of which could be seen the silhouette of a womans form leaning eagerly forward with arms outstretched in an appeal for help it vanished while she looked but the effect remained holding her to her seat for one startled moment this seemed strange for she had anticipated adventure one is not summoned from a private ball to ride a dozen miles into the country on an errand of investigation without some expectation of encountering the mysterious and the tragic but violet strange for all her many experiences was of a most susceptible nature and for the instant in which that door stood open with only the memory of that expectant figure to disturb the faintly lit vista of the hall beyond she felt that grip upon the throat which comes from an indefinable fear which no words can explain and no plummet sound but this soon passed with the setting of her foot to ground conditions changed and her emotions took on a more normal character the figure of a man now stood in the place held by the vanished woman and it was not only that of one she knew but that of one whom she trusteda friend whose very presence gave her courage with this recognition came a better understanding of the situation and it was with a beaming eye and unclouded features that she tripped up the walk to meet the expectant figure and outstretched hand of roger upjohn you here she exclaimed amid smiles and blushes as he drew her into the hall he at once launched forth into explanations mingled with apologies for the presumption he had shown in putting her to this inconvenience there was trouble in the housegreat trouble something had occurred for which an explanation must be found before morning or the happiness and honour of more than one person now under this unhappy roof would be wrecked he knew it was latethat she had been obliged to take a long and dreary ride alone but her success with the problem which had once come near wrecking his own life had emboldened him to telephone to the office and but you are in balldress he cried in amazement did you think i came from a ball word reached me between the dances i did not go home i had been bidden to hurry he looked his appreciation but when he spoke it was to say this is the situation miss digby the lady who is to be married tomorrow who hopes to be married tomorrow how hopes who will be married tomorrow if a certain article lost in this house tonight can be found before any of the persons who have been dining here leave for their homes violet uttered an exclamation then mr cornell she began mr cornell has our utmost confidence roger hastened to interpose but the article missing is one which he might reasonably desire to possess and which he alone of all present had the opportunity of securing you can therefore see why he with his pridethe pride of a man not rich engaged to marry a woman who isshould declare that unless his innocence is established before daybreak the doors of st bartholomew will remain shut tomorrow but the article lostwhat is it miss digby will give you the particulars she is waiting to receive you he added with a gesture towards a halfopen door at their right violet glanced that way then cast her looks up and down the hall in which they stood do you know that you have not told me in whose house i am not hers i know she lives in the city and you are twelve miles from harlem miss strange you are in the van broecklyn mansion famous enough you will acknowledge have you never been here before i have been by here but i recognised nothing in the dark what an exciting place for an investigation and mr van broecklyn have you never met him once when a child he frightened me then and may frighten you now though i doubt it time has mellowed him besides i have prepared him for what might otherwise occasion him some astonishment naturally he would not look for just the sort of lady investigator i am about to introduce to him she smiled violet strange was a very charming young woman as well as a keen prober of odd mysteries the meeting between herself and miss digby was a sympathetic one after the first inevitable shock which the latter felt at sight of the beauty and fashionable appearance of the mysterious little being who was to solve her difficulties her glance which under other circumstances might have lingered unduly upon the piquant features and exquisite dressing of the fairylike figure before her passed at once to violets eyes in whose steady depths beamed an intelligence quite at odds with the coquettish dimples which so often misled the casual observer in his estimation of a character singularly subtle and wellpoised as for the impression she herself made upon violet it was the same she made upon everyone no one could look long at florence digby and not recognise the loftiness of her spirit and the generous nature of her impulses in person she was tall and as she leaned to take violets hand the difference between them brought out the salient points in each to the great admiration of the one onlooker meantime for all her interest in the case in hand violet could not help casting a hurried look about her in gratification of the curiosity incited by her entrance into a house signalised from its foundation by such a series of tragic events the result was disappointing the walls were plain the furniture simple nothing suggestive in either unless it was the fact that nothing was new nothing modern as it looked in the days of burr and hamilton so it looked today even to the rather startling detail of candles which did duty on every side in place of gas as violet recalled the reason for this the fascination of the past seized upon her imagination there was no knowing where this might have carried her had not the feverish gleam in miss digbys eyes warned her that the present held its own excitement instantly she was all attention and listening with undivided mind to that ladys disclosures they were brief and to the following effect the dinner which had brought some halfdozen people together in this house had been given in celebration of her impending marriage but it was also in a way meant as a compliment to one of the other guests a mr spielhagen who during the week had succeeded in demonstrating to a few experts the value of a discovery he had made which would transform a great industry in speaking of this discovery miss digby did not go into particulars the whole matter being far beyond her understanding but in stating its value she openly acknowledged that it was in the line of mr cornells own work and one which involved calculations and a formula which if prematurely disclosed would invalidate the contract mr spielhagen hoped to make and thus destroy his present hopes of this formula but two copies existed one was locked up in a safe deposit vault in boston the other he had brought into the house on his person and it was the latter which was now missing it having been abstracted during the evening from a manuscript of sixteen or more sheets under circumstances which she would now endeavour to relate mr van broecklyn their host had in his melancholy life but one interest which could be called at all absorbing this was for explosives as a consequence much of the talk at the dinnertable had been on mr spielhagens discovery and the possible changes it might introduce into this especial industry as these worked out from a formula kept secret from the trade could not but affect greatly mr cornells interests she found herself listening intently when mr van broecklyn with an apology for his interference ventured to remark that if mr spielhagen had made a valuable discovery in this line so had he and one which he had substantiated by many experiments it was not a marketable one such as mr spielhagens was but in his work upon the same and in the tests which he had been led to make he had discovered certain instances he would gladly name which demanded exceptional procedure to be successful if mr spielhagens method did not allow for these exceptions nor make suitable provision for them then mr spielhagens method would fail more times than it would succeed did it so allow and so provide it would relieve him greatly to learn that it did the answer came quickly yes it did but later and after some further conversation mr spielhagens confidence seemed to wane and before they left the dinnertable he openly declared his intention of looking over his manuscript again that very night in order to be sure that the formula therein contained duly covered all the exceptions mentioned by mr van broecklyn if mr cornells countenance showed any change at this moment she for one had not noticed it but the bitterness with which he remarked upon the others good fortune in having discovered this formula of whose entire success he had no doubt was apparent to everybody and naturally gave point to the circumstances which a short time afterward associated him with the disappearance of the same the ladies there were two others besides herself having withdrawn in a body to the musicroom the gentlemen all proceeded to the library to smoke here conversation loosed from the one topic which had hitherto engrossed it was proceeding briskly when mr spielhagen with a nervous gesture impulsively looked about him and said i cannot rest till i have run through my thesis again where can i find a quiet spot i wont be long i read very rapidly it was for mr van broecklyn to answer but no word coming from him every eye turned his way only to find him sunk in one of those fits of abstraction so well known to his friends and from which no one who has this strange mans peace of mind at heart ever presumes to rouse him what was to be done these moods of their singular host sometimes lasted half an hour and mr spielhagen had not the appearance of a man of patience indeed he presently gave proof of the great uneasiness he was labouring under for noticing a door standing ajar on the other side of the room he remarked to those around him a den and lighted do you see any objection to my shutting myself in there for a few minutes no one venturing to reply he rose and giving a slight push to the door disclosed a small room exquisitely panelled and brightly lighted but without one article of furniture in it not even a chair the very place quoth mr spielhagen and lifting a light canebottomed chair from the many standing about he carried it inside and shut the door behind him several minutes passed during which the man who had served at table entered with a tray on which were several small glasses evidently containing some choice liqueur finding his master fixed in one of his strange moods he set the tray down and pointing to one of the glasses said that is for mr van broecklyn it contains his usual quieting powder and urging the gentlemen to help themselves he quietly left the room mr upjohn lifted the glass nearest him and mr cornell seemed about to do the same when he suddenly reached forward and catching up one farther off started for the room in which mr spielhagen had so deliberately secluded himself why he did all thiswhy above all things he should reach across the tray for a glass instead of taking the one under his hand he can no more explain than why he has followed many another unhappy impulse nor did he understand the nervous start given by mr spielhagen at his entrance or the stare with which that gentleman took the glass from his hand and mechanically drank its contents till he saw how his hand had stretched itself across the sheet of paper he was reading in an open attempt to hide the lines visible between his fingers then indeed the intruder flushed and withdrew in great embarrassment fully conscious of his indiscretion but not deeply disturbed till mr van broecklyn suddenly arousing and glancing down at the tray placed very near his hand remarked in some surprise dobbs seems to have forgotten me then indeed the unfortunate mr cornell realised what he had done it was the glass intended for his host which he had caught up and carried into the other roomthe glass which he had been told contained a drug of what folly he had been guilty and how tame would be any effort at excuse attempting none he rose and with a hurried glance at mr upjohn who flushed in sympathy at his distress he crossed to the door he had so lately closed upon mr spielhagen but feeling his shoulder touched as his hand pressed the knob he turned to meet the eye of mr van broecklyn fixed upon him with an expression which utterly confounded him where are you going that gentleman asked the questioning tone the severe look expressive at once of displeasure and astonishment were most disconcerting but mr cornell managed to stammer forth mr spielhagen is in here consulting his thesis when your man brought in the cordial i was awkward enough to catch up your glass and carry it in to mr spielhagen he drank it and ii am anxious to see if it did him any harm as he uttered the last word he felt mr van broecklyns hand slip from his shoulder but no word accompanied the action nor did his host make the least move to follow him into the room this was a matter of great regret to him later as it left him for a moment out of the range of every eye during which he says he simply stood in a state of shock at seeing mr spielhagen still sitting there manuscript in hand but with head fallen forward and eyes closed dead asleep orhe hardly knew what the sight so paralysed him whether or not this was the exact truth and the whole truth mr cornell certainly looked very unlike himself as he stepped back into mr van broecklyns presence and he was only partially reassured when that gentleman protested that there was no real harm in the drug and that mr spielhagen would be all right if left to wake naturally and without shock however as his present attitude was one of great discomfort they decided to carry him back and lay him on the library lounge but before doing this mr upjohn drew from his flaccid grasp the precious manuscript and carrying it into the larger room placed it on a remote table where it remained undisturbed till mr spielhagen suddenly coming to himself at the end of some fifteen minutes missed the sheets from his hand and bounding up crossed the room to repossess himself of them his face as he lifted them up and rapidly ran through them with ever accumulating anxiety told them what they had to expect the page containing the formula was gone violet now saw her problem ii there was no doubt about the loss i have mentioned all could see that page was not there in vain a second handling of every sheet the one so numbered was not to be found page met the eye on the top of the pile and page finished it off at the bottom but no page in between or anywhere else where had it vanished and through whose agency had this misadventure occurred no one could say or at least no one there made any attempt to do so though everybody started to look for it but where look the adjoining small room offered no facilities for hiding a cigarend much less a square of shining white paper bare walls a bare floor and a single chair for furniture comprised all that was to be seen in this direction nor could the room in which they then stood be thought to hold it unless it was on the person of some one of them could this be the explanation of the mystery no man looked his doubts but mr cornell possibly divining the general feeling stepped up to mr van broecklyn and in a cool voice but with the red burning hotly on either cheek said so as to be heard by everyone present i demand to be searchedat once and thoroughly a moments silence then the common cry we will all be searched is mr spielhagen sure that the missing page was with the others when he sat down in the adjoining room to read his thesis asked their perturbed host very sure came the emphatic reply indeed i was just going through the formula itself when i fell asleep you are ready to assert this i am ready to swear it mr cornell repeated his request i demand that you make a thorough search of my person i must be cleared and instantly of every suspicion he gravely asserted or how can i marry miss digby tomorrow after that there was no further hesitation one and all subjected themselves to the ordeal suggested even mr spielhagen but this effort was as futile as the rest the lost page was not found what were they to think what were they to do there seemed to be nothing left to do and yet some further attempt must be made towards the recovery of this important formula mr cornells marriage and mr spielhagens business success both depended upon its being in the latters hands before six in the morning when he was engaged to hand it over to a certain manufacturer sailing for europe on an early steamer five hours had mr van broecklyn a suggestion to offer no he was as much at sea as the rest simultaneously look crossed look blankness was on every face let us call the ladies suggested one it was done and however great the tension had been before it was even greater when miss digby stepped upon the scene but she was not a woman to be shaken from her poise even by a crisis of this importance when the dilemma had been presented to her and the full situation grasped she looked first at mr cornell and then at mr spielhagen and quietly said there is but one explanation possible of this matter mr spielhagen will excuse me but he is evidently mistaken in thinking that he saw the lost page among the rest the condition into which he was thrown by the unaccustomed drug he had drank made him liable to hallucinations i have not the least doubt he thought he had been studying the formula at the time he dropped off to sleep i have every confidence in the gentlemans candour but so have i in that of mr cornell she supplemented with a smile an exclamation from mr van broecklyn and a subdued murmur from all but mr spielhagen testified to the effect of this suggestion and there is no saying what might have been the result if mr cornell had not hurriedly put in this extraordinary and most unexpected protest miss digby has my gratitude said he for a confidence which i hope to prove to be deserved but i must say this for mr spielhagen he was correct in stating that he was engaged in looking over his formula when i stepped into his presence with the glass of cordial if you were not in a position to see the hurried way in which his hand instinctively spread itself over the page he was reading i was and if that does not seem conclusive to you then i feel bound to state that in unconsciously following this movement of his i plainly saw the number written on the top of the page and that number was a loud exclamation this time from spielhagen himself announced his gratitude and corresponding change of attitude toward the speaker wherever that damned page has gone he protested advancing towards cornell with outstretched hand you have nothing to do with its disappearance instantly all constraint fled and every countenance took on a relieved expression but the problem remained suddenly those very words passed some ones lips and with their utterance mr upjohn remembered how at an extraordinary crisis in his own life he had been helped and an equally difficult problem settled by a little lady secretly attached to a private detective agency if she could only be found and hurried here before morning all might yet be well he would make the effort such wild schemes sometimes work he telephoned to the office and was there anything else miss strange would like to know iii miss strange thus appealed to asked where the gentlemen were now she was told that they were still all together in the library the ladies had been sent home then let us go to them said violet hiding under a smile her great fear that here was an affair which might very easily spell for her that dismal word failure so great was that fear that under all ordinary circumstances she would have had no thought for anything else in the short interim between this stating of the problem and her speedy entrance among the persons involved but the circumstances of this case were so far from ordinary or rather let me put it in this way the setting of the case was so very extraordinary that she scarcely thought of the problem before her in her great interest in the house through whose rambling halls she was being so carefully guided so much that was tragic and heartrending had occurred here the van broecklyn name the van broecklyn history above all the van broecklyn tradition which made the house unique in the countrys annals of which more hereafter all made an appeal to her imagination and centred her thoughts on what she saw about her there was a door which no man ever openedhad never opened since revolutionary times should she see it should she know it if she did see it then mr van broecklyn himself just to meet him under any conditions and in any place was an event but to meet him here under the pall of his own mystery no wonder she had no words for her companions or that her thoughts clung to this anticipation in wonder and almost fearsome delight his story was a wellknown one a bachelor and a misanthrope he lived absolutely alone save for a large entourage of servants all men and elderly ones at that he never visited though he now and then as on this occasion entertained certain persons under his roof he declined every invitation for himself avoiding even with equal strictness all evening amusements of whatever kind which would detain him in the city after ten at night perhaps this was to ensure no break in his rule of life never to sleep out of his own bed though he was a man well over fifty he had not spent according to his own statement but two nights out of his own bed since his return from europe in early boyhood and those were in obedience to a judicial summons which took him to boston this was his main eccentricity but he had another which is apparent enough from what has already been said he avoided women if thrown in with them during his short visits into town he was invariably polite and at times companionable but he never sought them out nor had gossip contrary to its usual habit ever linked his name with one of the sex yet he was a man of more than ordinary attraction his features were fine and his figure impressive he might have been the cynosure of all eyes had he chosen to enter crowded drawingrooms or even to frequent public assemblages but having turned his back upon everything of the kind in his youth he had found it impossible to alter his habits with advancing years nor was he now expected to the position he had taken was respected leonard van broecklyn was no longer criticised was there any explanation for this strangely selfcentred life those who knew him best seemed to think so in the first place he had sprung from an unfortunate stock events of an unusual and tragic nature had marked the family of both parents nor had his parents themselves been exempt from this seeming fatality antagonistic in tastes and temperament they had dragged on an unhappy existence in the old home till both natures rebelled and a separation ensued which not only disunited their lives but sent them to opposite sides of the globe never to return again at least that was the inference drawn from the peculiar circumstances attending the event on the morning of one nevertobeforgotten day john van broecklyn the grandfather of the present representative of the family found the following note from his son lying on the library table father life in this house or any house with her is no longer endurable one of us must go the mother should not be separated from her child therefore it is i whom you will never see again forget me but be considerate of her and the boy william six hours later another note was found this time from the wife father tied to a rotting corpse what does one do lop off ones arm if necessary to rid one of the contact as all love between your son and myself is dead i can no longer live within the sound of his voice as this is his home he is the one to remain in it may our child reap the benefit of his mothers loss and his fathers affection rhoda both were gone and gone forever simultaneous in their departure they preserved each his own silence and sent no word back if the one went east and the other west they may have met on the other side of the globe but never again in the home which sheltered their boy for him and for his grandfather they had sunk from sight in the great sea of humanity leaving them stranded on an isolated and mournful shore the grandfather steeled himself to the double loss for the childs sake but the boy of eleven succumbed few of the worlds great sufferers of whatever age or condition have mourned as this child mourned or shown the effects of his grief so deeply or so long not till he had passed his majority did the line carved in one day in his baby forehead lose any of its intensity and there are those who declare that even later than that the midnight stillness of the house was disturbed from time to time by his muffled shriek of mother mother sending the servants from the house and adding one more horror to the many which clung about this accursed mansion of this cry violet had heard and it was that and the doorbut i have already told you about the door which she was still looking for when her two companions suddenly halted and she found herself on the threshold of the library in full view of mr van broecklyn and his two guests slight and fairylike in figure with an air of modest reserve more in keeping with her youth and dainty dimpling beauty than with her errand her appearance produced an astonishment which none of the gentlemen were able to disguise this the clever detective with a genius for social problems and odd elusive cases this darling of the ballroom in satin and pearls mr spielhagen glanced at mr carroll and mr carroll at mr spielhagen and both at mr upjohn in very evident distrust as for violet she had eyes only for mr van broecklyn who stood before her in a surprise equal to that of the others but with more restraint in its expression she was not disappointed in him she had expected to see a man reserved almost to the point of austerity and she found his first look even more awecompelling than her imagination had pictured so much so indeed that her resolution faltered and she took a quick step backward which seeing he smiled and her heart and hopes grew warm again that he could smile and smile with absolute sweetness was her great comfort when laterbut i am introducing you too hurriedly to the catastrophe there is much to be told first i pass over the preliminaries and come at once to the moment when violet having listened to a repetition of the full facts stood with downcast eyes before these gentlemen complaining in some alarm to herself they expect me to tell them now and without further search or parley just where this missing page is i shall have to balk that expectation without losing their confidence but how summoning up her courage and meeting each inquiring eye with a look which seemed to carry a different message to each she remarked very quietly this is not a matter to guess at i must have time and i must look a little deeper into the facts just given me i presume that the table i see over there is the one upon which mr upjohn laid the manuscript during mr spielhagens unconsciousness all nodded is iti mean the tablein the same condition it was then has nothing been taken from it except the manuscript nothing then the missing page is not there she smiled pointing to its bare top a pause during which she stood with her gaze fixed on the floor before her she was thinking and thinking hard suddenly she came to a decision addressing mr upjohn she asked if he were quite sure that in taking the manuscript from mr spielhagens hand he had neither disarranged nor dropped one of its pages the answer was unequivocal then she declared with quiet assurance and a steady meeting with her own of every eye as the thirteenth page was not found among the others when they were taken from this table nor on the persons of either mr carroll or mr spielhagen it is still in that inner room impossible came from every lip each in a different tone that room is absolutely empty may i have a look at its emptiness she asked with a naive glance at mr van broecklyn there is positively nothing in the room but the chair mr spielhagen sat on objected that gentleman with a noticeable air of reluctance still may i not have a look at it she persisted with that disarming smile she kept for great occasions mr van broecklyn bowed he could not refuse a request so urged but his step was slow and his manner next to ungracious as he led the way to the door of the adjoining room and threw it open just what she had been told to expect bare walls and floors and an empty chair yet she did not instantly withdraw but stood silently contemplating the panelled wainscoting surrounding her as though she suspected it of containing some secret hidingplace not apparent to the eye mr van broecklyn noting this hastened to say the walls are sound miss strange they contain no hidden cupboards and that door she asked pointing to a portion of the wainscoting so exactly like the rest that only the most experienced eye could detect the line of deeper colour which marked an opening for an instant mr van broecklyn stood rigid then the immovable pallor which was one of his chief characteristics gave way to a deep flush as he explained there was a door there once but it has been permanently closed with cement he forced himself to add his countenance losing its evanescent colour till it shone ghastly again in the strong light with difficulty violet preserved her show of composure the door she murmured to herself i have found it the great historic door but her tone was light as she ventured to say then it can no longer be opened by your hand or any other it could not be opened with an axe violet sighed in the midst of her triumph her curiosity had been satisfied but the problem she had been set to solve looked inexplicable but she was not one to yield easily to discouragement marking the disappointment approaching to disdain in every eye but mr upjohns she drew herself upshe had not far to draw and made this final proposal a sheet of paper she remarked of the size of this one cannot be spirited away or dissolved into thin air it exists it is here and all we want is some happy thought in order to find it i acknowledge that that happy thought has not come to me yet but sometimes i get it in what may seem to you a very odd way forgetting myself i try to assume the individuality of the person who has worked the mystery if i can think with his thoughts i possibly may follow him in his actions in this case i should like to make believe for a few moments that i am mr spielhagen with what a delicious smile she said this i should like to hold his thesis in my hand and be interrupted in my reading by mr cornell offering his glass of cordial then i should like to nod and slip off mentally into a deep sleep possibly in that sleep the dream may come which will clarify the whole situation will you humour me so far a ridiculous concession but finally she had her way the farce was enacted and they left her as she had requested them to do alone with her dreams in the small room suddenly they heard her cry out and in another moment she appeared before them the picture of excitement is this chair standing exactly as it did when mr spielhagen occupied it she asked no said mr upjohn it faced the other way she stepped back and twirled the chair about with her disengaged hand so mr upjohn and mr spielhagen both nodded so did the others when she glanced at them with a sign of illconcealed satisfaction she drew their attention to herself then eagerly cried gentlemen look here seating herself she allowed her whole body to relax till she presented the picture of one calmly asleep then as they continued to gaze at her with fascinated eyes not knowing what to expect they saw something white escape from her lap and slide across the floor till it touched and was stayed by the wainscot it was the top page of the manuscript she held and as some inkling of the truth reached their astonished minds she sprang impetuously to her feet and pointing to the fallen sheet cried do you understand now look where it lies and then look here she had bounded towards the wall and was now on her knees pointing to the bottom of the wainscot just a few inches to the left of the fallen page a crack she cried under what was once the door its a very thin one hardly perceptible to the eye but see here she laid her finger on the fallen paper and drawing it towards her pushed it carefully against the lower edge of the wainscot half of it at once disappeared i could easily slip it all through she assured them withdrawing the sheet and leaping to her feet in triumph you know now where the missing page lies mr spielhagen all that remains is for mr van broecklyn to get it for you iv the cries of mingled astonishment and relief which greeted this simple elucidation of the mystery were broken by a curiously choked almost unintelligible cry it came from the man thus appealed to who unnoticed by them all had started at her first word and gradually as action followed action withdrawn himself till he now stood alone and in an attitude almost of defiance behind the large table in the centre of the library i am sorry he began with a brusqueness which gradually toned down into a forced urbanity as he beheld every eye fixed upon him in amazement that circumstances forbid my being of assistance to you in this unfortunate matter if the paper lies where you say and i see no other explanation of its loss i am afraid it will have to remain there for this night at least the cement in which that door is embedded is thick as any wall it would take men with pickaxes possibly with dynamite to make a breach there wide enough for any one to reach in and we are far from any such help in the midst of the consternation caused by these words the clock on the mantel behind his back rang out the hour it was but a double stroke but that meant two hours after midnight and had the effect of a knell in the hearts of those most interested but i am expected to give that formula into the hands of our manager before six oclock in the morning the steamer sails at a quarter after cant you reproduce a copy of it from memory some one asked and insert it in its proper place among the pages you hold there the paper would not be the same that would lead to questions and the truth would come out as the chief value of the process contained in that formula lies in its secrecy no explanation i could give would relieve me from the suspicions which an acknowledgment of the existence of a third copy however well hidden would entail i should lose my great opportunity mr cornells state of mind can be imagined in an access of mingled regret and despair he cast a glance at violet who with a nod of understanding left the little room in which they still stood and approached mr van broecklyn lifting up her headfor he was very talland instinctively rising on her toes the nearer to reach his ear she asked in a cautious whisper is there no other way of reaching that place she acknowledged afterwards that for one moment her heart stood still from fear such a change took place in his face though she says he did not move a muscle then just when she was expecting from him some harsh or forbidding word he wheeled abruptly away from her and crossing to a window at his side lifted the shade and looked out when he returned he was his usual self so far as she could see there is a way he now confided to her in a tone as low as her own but it can only be taken by a child not by me she asked smiling down at her own childish proportions for an instant he seemed taken aback then she saw his hand begin to tremble and his lips twitch somehowshe knew not whyshe began to pity him and asked herself as she felt rather than saw the struggle in his mind that here was a trouble which if once understood would greatly dwarf that of the two men in the room behind them i am discreet she whisperingly declared i have heard the history of that doorhow it was against the tradition of the family to have it opened there must have been some dreadful reason but old superstitions do not affect me and if you will allow me to take the way you mention i will follow your bidding exactly and will not trouble myself about anything but the recovery of this paper which must lie only a little way inside that blockedup door was his look one of rebuke at her presumption or just the constrained expression of a perturbed mind probably the latter for while she watched him for some understanding of his mood he reached out his hand and touched one of the satin folds crossing her shoulder you would soil this irretrievably said he there is stuff in the stores for another she smiled slowly his touch deepened into pressure watching him she saw the rust of some old fear or dominant superstition melt under her eyes and was quite prepared when he remarked with what for him was a lightsome air i will buy the stuff if you will dare the darkness and intricacies of our old cellar i can give you no light you will have to feel your way according to my direction i am ready to dare anything he left her abruptly i will warn miss digby he called back she shall go with you as far as the cellar v violet in her short career as an investigator of mysteries had been in many a situation calling for more than womanly nerve and courage but neveror so it seemed to her at the timehad she experienced a greater depression of spirit than when she stood with miss digby before a small door at the extreme end of the cellar and understood that here was her roada road which once entered she must take alone first it was such a small door no child older than eleven could possibly squeeze through it but she was of the size of a child of eleven and might possibly manage that difficulty secondly there are always some unforeseen possibilities in every situation and though she had listened carefully to mr van broecklyns directions and was sure that she knew them by heart she wished she had kissed her father more tenderly in leaving him that night for the ball and that she had not pouted so undutifully at some harsh stricture he had made did this mean fear she despised the feeling if it did thirdly she hated darkness she knew this when she offered herself for this undertaking but she was in a bright room at the moment and only imagined what she must now face as a reality but one jet had been lit in the cellar and that near the entrance mr van broecklyn seemed not to need light even in his unfastening of the small door which violet was sure had been protected by more than one lock doubt shadow and a solitary climb between unknown walls with only a streak of light for her goal and the clinging pressure of florence digbys hand on her own for solacesurely the prospect was one to tax the courage of her young heart to its limit but she had promised and she would fulfil so with a brave smile she stooped to the little door and in another moment had started on her journey for journey the shortest distance may seem when every inch means a heartthrob and one grows old in traversing a foot at first the way was easy she had but to crawl up a slight incline with the comforting consciousness that two people were within reach of her voice almost within sound of her beating heart but presently she came to a turn beyond which her fingers failed to reach any wall on her left then came a step up which she stumbled and farther on a short flight each tread of which she had been told to test before she ventured to climb it lest the decay of innumerable years should have weakened the wood too much to bear her weight one two three four five steps then a landing with an open space beyond half of her journey was done here she felt she could give a minute to drawing her breath naturally if the air unchanged in years would allow her to do so besides here she had been enjoined to do a certain thing and to do it according to instructions three matches had been given her and a little night candle denied all light up to now it was at this point she was to light her candle and place it on the floor so that in returning she should not miss the staircase and get a fall she had promised to do this and was only too happy to see a spark of light scintillate into life in the immeasurable darkness she was now in a great room long closed to the world where once officers in colonial wars had feasted and more than one council had been held a room too which had seen more than one tragic happening as its almost unparalleled isolation proclaimed so much mr van broecklyn had told her but she was warned to be careful in traversing it and not upon any pretext to swerve aside from the righthand wall till she came to a huge mantelpiece this passed and a sharp corner turned she ought to see somewhere in the dim spaces before her a streak of vivid light shining through the crack at the bottom of the blockedup door the paper should be somewhere near this streak all simple all easy of accomplishment if only that streak of light were all she was likely to see or think of if the horror which was gripping her throat should not take shape if things would remain shrouded in impenetrable darkness and not force themselves in shadowy suggestion upon her excited fancy but the blackness of the passageway through which she had just struggled was not to be found here whether it was the effect of that small flame flickering at the top of the staircase behind her or of some change in her own powers of seeing surely there was a difference in her present outlook tall shapes were becoming visiblethe air was no longer blankshe could seethen suddenly she saw why in the wall high up on her right was a window it was small and all but invisible being covered on the outside with vines and on the inside with the cobwebs of a century but some small gleams from the starlight night came through making phantasms out of ordinary things which unseen were horrible enough and half seen choked her heart with terror i cannot bear it she whispered to herself even while creeping forward her hand upon the wall i will close my eyes was her next thought i will make my own darkness and with a spasmodic forcing of her lids together she continued to creep on passing the mantelpiece where she knocked against something which fell with an awful clatter this sound followed as it was by that of smothered voices from the excited group awaiting the result of her experiment from behind the impenetrable wall she should be nearing now if she had followed her instructions aright freed her instantly from her fancies and opening her eyes once more she cast a look ahead and to her delight saw but a few steps away the thin streak of bright light which marked the end of her journey it took her but a moment after that to find the missing page and picking it up in haste from the dusty floor she turned herself quickly about and joyfully began to retrace her steps why then was it that in the course of a few minutes more her voice suddenly broke into a wild unearthly shriek which ringing with terror burst the bounds of that dungeonlike room and sank a barbed shaft into the breasts of those awaiting the result of her doubtful adventure at either end of this dread nothoroughfare what had happened if they had thought to look out they would have seen that the moonheld in check by a bank of cloud occupying half the heavenshad suddenly burst its bounds and was sending long bars of revealing light into every uncurtained window vi florence digby in her short and sheltered life had possibly never known any very great or deep emotion but she touched the bottom of extreme terror at that moment as with her ears still thrilling with violets piercing cry she turned to look at mr van broecklyn and beheld the instantaneous wreck it had made of this seemingly strong man not till he came to lie in his coffin would he show a more ghastly countenance and trembling herself almost to the point of falling she caught him by the arm and sought to read in his face what had happened something disastrous she was sure something which he had feared and was partially prepared for yet which in happening had crushed him was it a pitfall into which the poor little lady had fallen if sobut he is speakingmumbling low words to himself some of them she can hear he is reproaching himselfrepeating over and over that he should never have taken such a chance that he should have remembered her youththe weakness of a young girls nerve he had been mad and nowand now with the repetition of this word his murmuring ceased all his energies were now absorbed in listening at the low door separating him from what he was agonising to knowa door impossible to enter impossible to enlargea barrier to all helpan opening whereby sound might pass but nothing else save her own small body now lying where is she hurt faltered florence stooping herself to listen can you hear anythinganything for an instant he did not answer every faculty was absorbed in the one sense then slowly and in gasps he began to mutter i thinki hearsomething her stepno no no step all is as quiet as death not a soundnot a breathshe has fainted o god o god why this calamity on top of all he had sprung to his feet at the utterance of this invocation but next moment was down on his knees again listeninglistening never was silence more profound they were hearkening for murmurs from a tomb florence began to sense the full horror of it all and was swaying helplessly when mr van broecklyn impulsively lifted his hand in an admonitory hush and through the daze of her faculties a small far sound began to make itself heard growing louder as she waited then becoming faint again then altogether ceasing only to renew itself once more till it resolved into an approaching step faltering in its course but coming ever nearer and nearer shes safe shes not hurt sprang from florences lips in inexpressible relief and expecting mr van broecklyn to show an equal joy she turned towards him with the cheerful cry now if she has been so fortunate as to find that missing page we shall all be repaid for our fright a movement on his part a shifting of position which brought him finally to his feet but he gave no other proof of having heard her nor did his countenance mirror her relief it is as if he dreaded instead of hailed her return was florences inward comment as she watched him involuntarily recoil at each fresh token of violets advance yet because this seemed so very unnatural she persisted in her efforts to lighten the situation and when he made no attempt to encourage violet in her approach she herself stooped and called out a cheerful welcome which must have rung sweetly in the poor little detectives ears a sorry sight was violet when helped by florence she finally crawled into view through the narrow opening and stood once again on the cellar floor pale trembling and soiled with the dust of years she presented a helpless figure enough till the joy in florences face recalled some of her spirit and glancing down at her hand in which a sheet of paper was visible she asked for mr spielhagen ive got the formula she said if you will bring him i will hand it over to him here not a word of her adventure nor so much as one glance at mr van broecklyn standing far back in the shadows nor was she more communicative when the formula restored and everything made right with mr spielhagen they all came together again in the library for a final word i was frightened by the silence and the darkness and so cried out she explained in answer to their questions any one would have done so who found himself alone in so musty a place she added with an attempt at lightsomeness which deepened the pallor on mr van broecklyns cheek already sufficiently noticeable to have been remarked upon by more than one no ghosts laughed mr cornell too happy in the return of his hopes to be fully sensible of the feelings of those about him no whispers from impalpable lips or touches from spectre hands nothing to explain the mystery of that room so long shut up that even mr van broecklyn declares himself ignorant of its secret nothing returned violet showing her dimples in full force now if miss strange had any such experiencesif she has anything to tell worthy of so marked a curiosity she will tell it now came from the gentleman just alluded to in tones so stern and strange that all show of frivolity ceased on the instant have you anything to tell miss strange greatly startled she regarded him with widening eyes for a moment then with a move towards the door remarked with a general look about her mr van broecklyn knows his own house and doubtless can relate its histories if he will i am a busy little body who having finished my work am now ready to return home there to wait for the next problem which an indulgent fate may offer me she was near the thresholdshe was about to take her leave when suddenly she felt two hands fall on her shoulder and turning met the eyes of mr van broecklyn burning into her own you sawdropped in an almost inaudible whisper from his lips the shiver which shook her answered him better than any word with an exclamation of despair he withdrew his hands and facing the others now standing together in a startled group he said as soon as he could recover some of his selfpossession i must ask for another hour of your company i can no longer keep my sorrow to myself a dividing line has just been drawn across my life and i must have the sympathy of someone who knows my past or i shall go mad in my selfimposed solitude come back miss strange you of all others have the prior right to hear vii i shall have to begin said he when they were all seated and ready to listen by giving you some idea not so much of the family tradition as of the effect of this tradition upon all who bore the name of van broecklyn this is not the only house even in america which contains a room shut away from intrusion in england there are many but there is this difference between most of them and ours no bars or locks forcibly held shut the door we were forbidden to open the command was enough that and the superstitious fear which such a command attended by a long and unquestioning obedience was likely to engender i know no more than you do why some early ancestor laid his ban upon this room but from my earliest years i was given to understand that there was one latch in the house which was never to be lifted that any fault would be forgiven sooner than that that the honour of the whole family stood in the way of disobedience and that i was to preserve that honour to my dying day you will say that all this is fantastic and wonder that sane people in these modern times should subject themselves to such a ridiculous restriction especially when no good reason was alleged and the very source of the tradition from which it sprung forgotten you are right but if you look long into human nature you will see that the bonds which hold the firmest are not material onesthat an idea will make a man and mould a characterthat it lies at the source of all heroisms and is to be courted or feared as the case may be for me it possessed a power proportionate to my loneliness i dont think there was ever a more lonely child my father and mother were so unhappy in each others companionship that one or other of them was almost always away but i saw little of either even when they were at home the constraint in their attitude towards each other affected their conduct towards me i have asked myself more than once if either of them had any real affection for me to my father i spoke of her to her of him and never pleasurably this i am forced to say or you cannot understand my story would to god i could tell another tale would to god i had such memories as other men have of a fathers clasp a mothers kissbut no my grief already profound might have become abysmal perhaps it is best as it is only i might have been a different child and made for myself a different fatewho knows as it was i was thrown almost entirely upon my own resources for any amusement this led me to a discovery i made one day in a far part of the cellar behind some heavy casks i found a little door it was so lowso exactly fitted to my small body that i had the greatest desire to enter it but i could not get around the casks at last an expedient occurred to me we had an old servant who came nearer loving me than any one else one day when i chanced to be alone in the cellar i took out my ball and began throwing it about finally it landed behind the casks and i ran with a beseeching cry to michael to move them it was a task requiring no little strength and address but he managed after a few herculean efforts to shift them aside and i saw with delight my way opened to that mysterious little door but i did not approach it then some instinct deterred me but when the opportunity came for me to venture there alone i did so in the most adventurous spirit and began my operations by sliding behind the casks and testing the handle of the little door it turned and after a pull or two the door yielded with my heart in my mouth i stooped and peered in i could see nothinga black hole and nothing more this caused me a moments hesitation i was afraid of the darkhad always been but curiosity and the spirit of adventure triumphed saying to myself that i was robinson crusoe exploring the cave i crawled in only to find that i had gained nothing it was as dark inside as it had looked to be from without there is no fun in this so i crawled back and when i tried the experiment again it was with a bit of candle in my hand and a surreptitious match or two what i saw when with a very trembling little hand i had lighted one of the matches would have been disappointing to most boys but not to me the litter and old boards i saw in odd corners about me were full of possibilities while in the dimness beyond i seemed to perceive a sort of staircase which might leadi do not think i made any attempt to answer that question even in my own mind but when after some hesitation and a sense of great daring i finally crept up those steps i remember very well my sensation at finding myself in front of a narrow closed door it suggested too vividly the one in grandfathers little roomthe door in the wainscot which we were never to open i had my first real trembling fit here and at once fascinated and repelled by this obstruction i stumbled and lost my candle which going out in the fall left me in total darkness and a very frightened state of mind for my imagination which had been greatly stirred by my own vague thoughts of the forbidden room immediately began to people the space about me with ghoulish figures how should i escape them how ever reach my own little room again undetected and in safety but these terrors deep as they were were nothing to the real fright which seized me when the darkness finally braved and the way found back into the bright wideopen halls of the house i became conscious of having dropped something besides the candle my matchbox was gonenot my matchbox but my grandfathers which i had found lying on his table and carried off on this adventure in all the confidence of irresponsible youth to make use of it for a little while trusting to his not missing it in the confusion i had noticed about the house that morning was one thing to lose it was another it was no common box made of gold and cherished for some special reason well known to himself i had often heard him say that some day i would appreciate its value and be glad to own it and i had left it in that hole and at any minute he might miss itpossibly ask for it the day was one of torment my mother was away or shut up in her room my fatheri dont know just what thoughts i had about him he was not to be seen either and the servants cast strange looks at me when i spoke his name but i little realised the blow which had just fallen upon the house in his definite departure and only thought of my own trouble and of how i should meet my grandfathers eye when the hour came for him to draw me to his knee for his usual goodnight that i was spared this ordeal for the first time this very night first comforted me then added to my distress he had discovered his loss and was angry on the morrow he would ask me for the box and i would have to lie for never could i find the courage to tell him where i had been such an act of presumption he would never forgive or so i thought as i lay and shivered in my little bed that his coldness his neglect sprang from the discovery just made that my mother as well as my father had just fled the house forever was as little known to me as the morning calamity i had been given my usual tendance and was tucked safely into bed but the gloom the silence which presently settled upon the house had a very different explanation in my mind from the real one my sin for such it loomed large in my mind by this time coloured the whole situation and accounted for every event at what hour i slipped from my bed on to the cold floor i shall never know to me it seemed to be in the dead of night but i doubt if it were more than ten so slowly creep away the moments to a wakeful child i had made a great resolve awful as the prospect seemed to mefrightened as i was by the very thoughti had determined in my small mind to go down into the cellar and into that midnight hole again in search of the lost box i would take a candle and matches this time from my own mantelshelf and if everyone was asleep as appeared from the deathly quiet of the house i would be able to go and come without anybody ever being the wiser dressing in the dark i found my matches and my candle and putting them in one of my pockets softly opened my door and looked out nobody was stirring every light was out except a solitary one in the lower hall that this still burned conveyed no meaning to my mind how could i know that the house was so still and the rooms so dark because everyone was out searching for some clue to my mothers flight if i had looked at the clockbut i did not i was too intent upon my errand too filled with the fever of my desperate undertaking to be affected by anything not bearing directly upon it of the terror caused by my own shadow on the wall as i made the turn in the hall below i have as keen a recollection today as though it happened yesterday but that did not deter me nothing deterred me till safe in the cellar i crouched down behind the casks to get my breath again before entering the hole beyond i had made some noise in feeling my way around these casks and i trembled lest these sounds had been heard upstairs but this fear soon gave place to one far greater other sounds were making themselves heard a din of small skurrying feet above below on every side of me rats rats in the wall rats on the cellar bottom how i ever stirred from the spot i do not know but when i did stir it was to go forward and enter the uncanny hole i had intended to light my candle when i got inside but for some reason i went stumbling along in the dark following the wall till i got to the steps where i had dropped the box here a light was necessary but my hand did not go to my pocket i thought it better to climb the steps first and softly one foot found the tread and then another i had only three more to climb and then my right hand now feeling its way along the wall would be free to strike a match i climbed the three steps and was steadying myself against the door for a final plunge when something happenedsomething so strange so unexpected and so incredible that i wonder i did not shriek aloud in my terror the door was moving under my hand it was slowly opening inward i could feel the chill made by the widening crack moment by moment this chill increased the gap was growinga presence was therea presence before which i sank in a small heap upon the landing would it advance had it feethands was it a presence which could be felt whatever it was it made no attempt to pass and presently i lifted my head only to quake anew at the sound of a voicea human voicemy mothers voiceso near me that by putting out my arms i might have touched her she was speaking to my father i knew it from the tone she was saying words which little understood as they were made such a havoc in my youthful mind that i have never forgotten them i have come she said they think i have fled the house and are looking far and wide for me we shall not be disturbed who would think of looking here for either you or me here the word sank like a plummet in my breast i had known for some few minutes that i was on the threshold of the forbidden room but they were in it i can scarcely make you understand the tumult which this awoke in my brain somehow i had never thought that any such braving of the houses law would be possible i heard my fathers answer but it conveyed no meaning to me i also realised that he spoke from a distancethat he was at one end of the room while we were at the other i was presently to have this idea confirmed for while i was striving with all my might and main to subdue my very heartthrobs so that she would not hear me or suspect my presence the darknessi should rather say the blackness of the place yielded to a flash of lightningheat lightning all glare and no soundand i caught an instantaneous vision of my fathers figure standing with gleaming things about him which affected me at the moment as supernatural but which in later years i decided to have been weapons hanging on a wall she saw him too for she gave a quick laugh and said they would not need any candles and then there was another flash and i saw something in his hand and something in hers and though i did not yet understand i felt myself turning deathly sick and gave a choking gasp which was lost in the rush she made into the centre of the room and the keenness of her swift low cry gardetoi for only one of us will ever leave this room alive a duel a duel to the death between this husband and wifethis father and motherin this hole of dead tragedies and within the sight and hearing of their child has satan ever devised a scheme more hideous for ruining the life of an elevenyearold boy not that i took it all in at once i was too innocent and much too dazed to comprehend such hatred much less the passions which engendered it i only knew that something horriblesomething beyond the conception of my childish mindwas going to take place in the darkness before me and the terror of it made me speechless would to god it had made me deaf and blind and dead she had dashed from her corner and he had slid away from his as the next fantastic gleam which lit up the room showed me it also showed the weapons in their hands and for a moment i felt reassured when i saw that these were swords for i had seen them before with foils in their hands practising for exercise as they said in the great garret but the swords had buttons on them and this time the tips were sharp and shone in the keen light an exclamation from her and a growl of rage from him were followed by movements i could scarcely hear but which were terrifying from their very quiet then the sound of a clash the swords had crossed had the lightning flashed forth then the end of one of them might have occurred but the darkness remained undisturbed and when the glare relit the great room again they were already far apart this called out a word from him the one sentence he spokei can never forget it rhoda there is blood on your sleeve i have wounded you shall we call it off and fly as the poor creatures in there think we have to the opposite ends of the earth i almost spoke i almost added my childish plea to his for them to stopto remember me and stop but not a muscle in my throat responded to my agonized effort her cold clear no fell before my tongue was loosed or my heart freed from the ponderous weight crushing it i have vowed and keep my promises she went on in a tone quite strange to me what would eithers life be worth with the other alive and happy in this world he made no answer and those subtle movementsshadows of movements i might almost call themrecommenced then there came a sudden cry shrill and poignanthad grandfather been in his room he would surely have heard itand the flash coming almost simultaneously with its utterance i saw what has haunted my sleep from that day to this my father pinned against the wall sword still in hand and before him my mother fiercely triumphant her staring eyes fixed on his and nature could bear no more the band loosened from my throat the oppression lifted from my breast long enough for me to give one wild wail and she turned saw heaven sent its flashes quickly at this moment and recognising my childish form all the horror of her deed or so i have fondly hoped rose within her and she gave a start and fell full upon the point upturned to receive her a groan then a gasping sigh from him and silence settled upon the room and upon my heart and so far as i knew upon the whole created world that is my story friends do you wonder that i have never been or lived like other men after a few moments of sympathetic silence mr van broecklyn went on to say i dont think i ever had a moments doubt that my parents both lay dead on the floor of that great room when i came to myselfwhich may have been soon and may not have been for a long whilethe lightning had ceased to flash leaving the darkness stretching like a blank pall between me and that spot in which were concentrated all the terrors of which my imagination was capable i dared not enter it i dared not take one step that way my instinct was to fly and hide my trembling body again in my own bed and associated with this in fact dominating it and making me old before my time was anothernever to tell never to let any one least of all my grandfatherknow what that forbidden room now contained i felt in an irresistible sort of way that my fathers and mothers honour was at stake besides terror held me back i felt that i should die if i spoke childhood has such terrors and such heroisms silence often covers in such abysses of thought and feeling which astonish us in later years there is no suffering like a childs terrified by a secret which it dare not for some reason disclose events aided me when in desperation to see once more the light and all the things which linked me to lifemy little bed the toys on the windowsill my squirrel in its cagei forced myself to retraverse the empty house expecting at every turn to hear my fathers voice or come upon the image of my motheryes such was the confusion of my mind though i knew well enough even then that they were dead and that i should never hear the one or see the other i was so benumbed with the cold in my halfdressed condition that i woke in a fever next morning after a terrible dream which forced from my lips the cry of mother motheronly that i was cautious even in delirium this delirium and my flushed cheeks and shining eyes led them to be very careful of me i was told that my mother was away from home and when after two days of search they were quite sure that all efforts to find either her or my father were likely to prove fruitless that she had gone to europe where we would follow her as soon as i was well this promise offering as it did a prospect of immediate release from the terrors which were consuming me had an extraordinary effect upon me i got up out of my bed saying that i was well now and ready to start on the instant the doctor finding my pulse equable and my whole condition wonderfully improved and attributing it as was natural to my hope of soon joining my mother advised my whim to be humoured and this hope kept active till travel and intercourse with children should give me strength and prepare me for the bitter truth ultimately awaiting me they listened to him and in twentyfour hours our preparations were made we saw the house closedwith what emotions surging in one small breast i leave you to imagineand then started on our long tour for five years we wandered over the continent of europe my grandfather finding distraction as well as myself in foreign scenes and associations but return was inevitable what i suffered on reentering this house god and my sleepless pillow alone know had any discovery been made in our absence or would it be made now that renovation and repairs of all kinds were necessary time finally answered me my secret was safe and likely to continue so and this fact once settled life became endurable if not cheerful since then i have spent only two nights out of this house and they were unavoidable when my grandfather died i had the wainscot door cemented in it was done from this side and the cement painted to match the wood no one opened the door nor have i ever crossed its threshold sometimes i think i have been foolish and sometimes i know that i have been very wise my reason has stood firm how do i know that it would have done so if i had subjected myself to the possible discovery that one or both of them might have been saved if i had disclosed instead of concealed my adventure a pause during which white horror had shone on every face then with a final glance at violet he said what sequel do you see to this story miss strange i can tell the past i leave you to picture the future rising she let her eye travel from face to face till it rested on the one awaiting it when she answered dreamily if some morning in the news column there should appear an account of the ancient and historic home of the van broecklyns having burned to the ground in the night the whole country would mourn and the city feel defrauded of one of its treasures but there are five persons who would see in it the sequel which you ask for when this happened as it did happen some few weeks later the astonishing discovery was made that no insurance had been put upon this house why was it that after such a loss mr van broecklyn seemed to renew his youth it was a constant source of comment among his friends arthur b reeve it is sometimes said that thomas edison invented the twentieth century it could be said with equal justification that the publics fascination with science and inventions produced before world war i made possible the widespread success of arthur b reeves scientific sleuth craig kennedy reeve graduated from princeton university with a phi beta kappa key he then studied law but opted to practice journalism instead he worked as an editor of public opinion began writing science articles for magazines and created detective stories in which scientific gadgets are the focus of the plot and the means of its solution chemistry professor craig kennedy is reeves sleuth a newspaper reporter named walter jameson is the tagalong narrator who in the watson tradition asks the questions that provoke the scientificsounding explanations that made reeves books bestsellers in the united states and europe read today some of the professors science seems doubtful at best but in reeves day the pseudoscience sounded authentic enough to wow readers without the science reeves plots would be mundane certainly his characters are cut out of cardboard kennedy is a sherlock holmes imitation an omniscient sleuth whose ratiocinative powers are enhanced by his specialised knowledge whereas holmes is an expert on gentlemanly clues like varieties of cigar ash kennedy is a wiz regarding whatever is new in the world of science years before the federal bureau of investigation and its famous crime laboratory were created professor kennedy was bringing criminals to justice by identifying typewriter keys analyzing blood stains detecting drugs through chemistry using xrays and applying modern psychological principles the war department was so impressed by professor kennedy that it asked reeve to establish a scientific crime laboratory to help in the detection of the kaisers spies during world war i the beauty mask is typical of reeves work while readers today may chuckle delightedly at the no longer impressive scientific explanations that kennedy offers his earnestness only adds to the period charm of the piece and it is easy to imagine that the application of futuristic nuclear science to the unraveling of a crime was very exciting stuff in more innocent times the beauty mask oh mr jameson if they could only wake her upfind out what is the matterdo something this suspense is killing both mother and myself scenting a good feature story my city editor had sent me out on an assignment my sole equipment being a clipping of two paragraphs from the morning star girl in coma six daysshows no sign of revival virginia blakeley the nineteenyearold daughter of mrs stuart blakeley of riverside drive who has been in a state of coma for six days still shows no sign of returning consciousness ever since monday some member of her family has been constantly beside her her mother and sister have both vainly tried to coax her back to consciousness but their efforts have not met with the slightest response dr calvert haynes the family physician and several specialists who have been called in consultation are completely baffled by the strange malady often i had read of cases of morbid sleep lasting for days and even for weeks but this was the first case i had ever actually encountered and i was glad to take the assignment the blakeleys as every one knew had inherited from stuart blakeley a very considerable fortune in real estate in one of the most rapidly developing sections of upper new york and on the death of their mother the two girls virginia and cynthia would be numbered among the wealthiest heiresses of the city they lived in a big sandstone mansion fronting the hudson and it was with some misgiving that i sent up my card both mrs blakeley and her other daughter however met me in the receptionroom thinking perhaps from what i had written on the card that i might have some assistance to offer mrs blakeley was a wellpreserved lady past middleage and very nervous mercy cynthia she exclaimed as i explained my mission its another one of those reporters no i cannot say anythingnot a word i dont know anything see doctor haynes i but mother interposed cynthia more calmly the thing is in the papers it may be that some one who reads of it may know of something that can be done who can tell well i wont say anything persisted the elder woman i dont like all this publicity did the newspapers ever do anything but harm to your poor dear father no i wont talk it wont do us a bit of good and you cynthia had better be careful mrs blakeley backed out of the door but cynthia who was a few years older than her sister had evidently acquired independence at least she felt capable of coping with an ordinary reporter who looked no more formidable than myself it is quite possible that some one who knows about such cases may learn of this i urged she hesitated as her mother disappeared and looked at me a moment then her feelings getting the better of her burst forth with the strange appeal i have already quoted it was as though i had come at just an opportune moment when she must talk to some outsider to relieve her pentup feelings by an adroit question here and there as we stood in the receptionhall i succeeded in getting the story which seemed to be more of human interest than of news i even managed to secure a photograph of virginia as she was before the strange sleep fell on her briefly as her sister told it virginia was engaged to hampton haynes a young medical student at the college where his father was a professor of diseases of the heart the hayneses were of a fine southern family which had never recovered from the war and had finally come to new york the father dr calvert haynes in addition to being a wellknown physician was the family physician of the blakeleys as i already knew twice the date of the marriage has been set only to be postponed added cynthia blakeley we dont know what to do and hampton is frantic then this is really the second attack of the morbid sleep i queried yesin a few weeks only the other wasnt so longnot more than a day she said it in a hesitating manner which i could not account for either she thought there might be something more back of it or she recalled her mothers aversion to reporters and did not know whether she was saying too much or not do you really fear that there is something wrong i asked significantly hastily choosing the former explanation cynthia blakeley looked quickly at the door through which her mother had retreated ii dont know she replied tremulously i dont know why i am talking to you im so afraid too that the newspapers may say something that isnt true you would like to get at the truth if i promise to hold the story back i persisted catching her eye yes she answered in a low tone but then stopped i will ask my friend professor kennedy at the university to come here i urged you know him she asked eagerly he will come without a doubt i reassured waiting for her to say no more but picking up the telephone receiver on a stand in the hall fortunately i found craig at his laboratory and a few hasty words were all that was necessary to catch his interest i must tell mother cynthia cried excitedly as i hung up the receiver surely she cannot object to that will you wait here as i waited for craig i tried to puzzle the case out for myself though i knew nothing about it as yet i felt sure that i had not made a mistake and that there was some mystery here suddenly i became aware that the two women were talking in the next room though too low for me to catch what they were saying it was evident however that cynthia was having some difficulty in persuading her mother that everything was all right well cynthia i heard her mother say finally as she left the room for one farther back i hope it will be all rightthat is all i can say what was it that mrs blakeley so feared was it merely the unpleasant notoriety one could not help the feeling that there was something more that she suspected perhaps knew but would not tell yet apparently it was aside from her desire to have her daughter restored to normal she was at sea herself i felt poor dear mother murmured cynthia rejoining me in a few moments she hardly knows just what it is she does wantexcept that we want virginia well again we had not long to wait for craig what i had told him over the telephone had been quite enough to arouse his curiosity both mrs blakeley and cynthia met him at first a little fearfully but quickly reassured by his manner as well as my promise to see that nothing appeared in the star which would be distasteful oh if some one could only bring back our little girl cried mrs blakeley with suppressed emotion leading the way with her daughter upstairs it was only for a moment that i could see craig alone to explain the impressions i had received but it was enough im glad you called me he whispered there is something queer we followed them up to the dainty bedroom in flowered enamel where virginia blakeley lay and it was then for the first time that we saw her kennedy drew a chair up beside the little white bed and went to work almost as though he had been a physician himself partly from what i observed myself and partly from what he told me afterward i shall try to describe the peculiar condition in which she was she lay there lethargic scarcely breathing once she had been a tall slender fair girl with a sort of wild grace now she seemed to be completely altered i could not help thinking of the contrast between her looks now and the photograph in my pocket not only was her respiration slow but her pulse was almost imperceptible less than forty a minute her temperature was far below normal and her blood pressure low once she had seemed fully a woman with all the strength and promise of precocious maturity but now there was something strange about her looks it is difficult to describe it was not that she was no longer a young woman but there seemed to be something almost sexless about her it was as though her secondary sex characteristics were no longer feminine butfor want of a better wordneuter yet strange to say in spite of the lethargy which necessitated at least some artificial feeding she was not falling away she seemed if anything plump to all appearances there was really a retardation of metabolism connected with the trancelike sleep she was actually gaining in weight as he noted one of these things after another kennedy looked at her long and carefully i followed the direction of his eyes over her nose just a trifle above the line of her eyebrows was a peculiar red mark a sore which was very disfiguring as though it were hard to heal what is that he asked mrs blakeley finally i dont know she replied slowly weve all noticed it it came just after the sleep began you have no idea what could have caused it both virginia and cynthia have been going to a face specialist she admitted to have their skins treated for freckles after the treatment they wore masks which were supposed to have some effect on the skin i dont know could it be that kennedy looked sharply at cynthias face there was no red mark over her nose but there were certainly no freckles on either of the girls faces now either oh mother remonstrated cynthia it couldnt be anything doctor chapelle did doctor chapelle repeated kennedy yes dr carl chapelle replied mrs blakeley perhaps you have heard of him he is quite well known has a beautyparlour on fifth avenue he its ridiculous cut in cynthia sharply why my face was worse than virgies carhe said it would take longer i had been watching cynthia but it needed only to have heard her to see that doctor chapelle was something more than a beauty specialist to her kennedy glanced thoughtfully from the clear skin of cynthia to the red mark on virginia though he said nothing i could see that his mind was on it i had heard of the beauty doctors who promise to give one a skin as soft and clear as a babysand often by their inexpert use of lotions and chemicals succeed in ruining the skin and disfiguring the patient for life could this be a case of that sort yet how explain the apparent success with cynthia the elder sister however was plainly vexed at the mention of the beauty doctors name at all and she showed it kennedy made a mental note of the matter but refrained from saying any more about it i suppose there is no objection to my seeing doctor haynes asked kennedy rising and changing the subject none whatever returned mrs blakeley if theres anything you or he can do to bring virginia out of thisanything safei want it done she emphasised cynthia was silent as we left evidently she had not expected doctor chapelles name to be brought into the case we were lucky in finding doctor haynes at home although it was not the regular time for his office hours kennedy introduced himself as a friend of the blakeleys who had been asked to see that i made no blunders in writing the story for the star doctor haynes did not question the explanation he was a man well on toward the sixties with that magnetic quality that inspires the confidence so necessary for a doctor far from wealthy he had attained a high place in the profession as kennedy finished his version of our mission doctor haynes shook his head with a deep sigh you can understand how i feel toward the blakeleys he remarked at length i should consider it unethical to give an interview under any circumstancesmuch more so under the present still i put in taking kennedys cue just a word to set me straight cant do any harm i wont quote you directly he seemed to realise that it might be better to talk carefully than to leave all to my imagination well he began slowly i have considered all the usual causes assigned for such morbid sleep it is not autosuggestion or trance i am positive nor is there any trace of epilepsy i cannot see how it could be due to poisoning can you i admitted readily that i could not no he resumed it is just a case of what we call narcolepsypathological somnolencea sudden uncontrollable inclination to sleep occurring sometimes repeatedly or at varying intervals i dont think it hysterical epileptic or toxemic the plain fact of the matter gentlemen is that neither myself nor any of my colleagues whom i have consulted have the faintest idea what it isyet the door of the office opened for it was not the hour for consulting patients and a tall athletic young fellow with a keen and restless face though very boyish entered my son the doctor introduced soon to be the sixth doctor haynes in direct line in the family we shook hands it was evident that cynthia had not by any means exaggerated when she said that he was frantic over what had happened to his fiancée accordingly there was no difficulty in reverting to the subject of our visit gradually i let kennedy take the lead in the conversation so that our position might not seem to be false it was not long before craig managed to inject a remark about the red spot over virginias nose it seemed to excite young hampton naturally i look on it more as a doctor than a lover remarked his father smiling indulgently at the young man whom it was evident he regarded above everything else in the world i have not been able to account for it either really the case is one of the most remarkable i have ever heard of you have heard of a dr carl chapelle inquired craig tentatively a beauty doctor interrupted the young man turning toward his father youve met him hes the fellow i think is really engaged to cynthia hampton seemed much excited there was unconcealed animosity in the manner of his remark and i wondered why it was could there be some latent jealousy i see calmed doctor haynes you mean to infer that thiserthis doctor chapelle he paused waiting for kennedy to take the initiative i suppose youve noticed over miss blakeleys nose a red sore hazarded kennedy yes replied doctor haynes rather refractory too i say interrupted hampton who by this time had reached a high pitch of excitement say do you think it could be any of his confounded nostrums back of this thing careful hampton cautioned the elder man id like to see him pursued craig to the younger you know him know him i should say i do goodlooking good practice and all that butwhy he must have hypnotized that girl cynthia thinks hes wonderful id like to see him suggested craig very well agreed hampton taking him at his word much as i dislike the fellow i have no objection to going down to his beautyparlour with you thank you returned craig as we excused ourselves and left the elder doctor haynes several times on our journey down hampton could not resist some reference to chapelle for commercialising the profession remarks which sounded strangely old on his lips chapelles office we found was in a large building on fifth avenue in the new shopping district where hundreds of thousands of women passed almost daily he called the place a dermatological institute but as hampton put it he practised decorative surgery as we entered one door we saw that patients left by another evidently as craig whispered when sixty sought to look like sixteen the seekers did not like to come in contact with one another we waited some time in a little private room at last doctor chapelle himself appeared a rather handsome man with the manner that one instinctively feels appeals to the ladies he shook hands with young haynes and i could detect no hostility on chapelles part but rather a friendly interest in a younger member of the medical profession again i was thrown forward as a buffer i was their excuse for being there however a newspaper experience gives you one thing if no otherassurance i believe you have a patient a miss virginia blakeley i ventured miss blakeley oh yes and her sister also the mention of the names was enough i was no longer needed as a buffer chapelle blurted out hampton you must have done something to her when you treated her face theres a little red spot over her nose that hasnt healed yet kennedy frowned at the impetuous interruption yet it was perhaps the best thing that could have happened so returned chapelle drawing back and placing his head on one side as he nodded it with each word you think ive spoiled her looks arent the freckles gone yes retorted hampton bitterly but on her face is this new disfigurement that shrugged chapelle i know nothing of thatnor of the trance i have only my specialty calm though he appeared outwardly one could see that chapelle was plainly worried under the circumstances might not his professional reputation be at stake what if a hint like this got abroad among his rich clientele i looked about his shop and wondered just how much of a faker he was once or twice i had heard of surgeons who had gone legitimately into this sort of thing but the common story was that of the swindleror worse i had heard of scores of cases of good looks permanently ruined seldom of any benefit had chapelle ignorantly done something that would leave its scar forever or was he one of the few who were honest and careful whatever the case kennedy had accomplished his purpose he had seen chapelle if he were really guilty of anything the chances were all in favour of his betraying it by trying to cover it up deftly suppressing hampton we managed to beat a retreat without showing our hands any further humph snorted hampton as we rode down in the elevator and hopped on a bus to go uptown gave up legitimate medicine and took up this beauty doctoringits unprofessional i tell you why he even advertises we left hampton and returned to the laboratory though craig had no present intention of staying there his visit was merely for the purpose of gathering some apparatus which included a crookes tube carefully packed a rheostat and some other paraphernalia which we divided a few moments later we were on our way again to the blakeley mansion no change had taken place in the condition of the patient and mrs blakeley met us anxiously nor was the anxiety wholly over her daughters condition for there seemed to be an air of relief when kennedy told her that we had little to report upstairs in the sickroom craig set silently to work attaching his apparatus to an electriclight socket from which he had unscrewed the bulb as he proceeded i saw that it was as i had surmised his new xray photographing machine which he had brought carefully from several angles he took photographs of virginias head then without saying a word packed up his kit and started away we were passing down the hall after leaving mrs blakeley when a figure stepped out from behind a portiere it was cynthia who had been waiting to see us alone youdont think doctor chapelle had anything to do with it she asked in a hoarse whisper then hampton haynes has been here avoided kennedy yes she admitted as though the question had been quite logical he told me of your visit to carl there was no concealment now of her anxiety indeed i saw no reason why there should be it was quite natural that the girl should worry over her lover if she thought there was even a haze of suspicion in kennedys mind really i have found out nothing yet was the only answer craig gave from which i readily deduced that he was well satisfied to play the game by pitting each against all in the hope of gathering here and there a bit of the truth as soon as i find out anything i shall let you and your mother know and you must tell me everything too he paused to emphasize the last words then slowly turned again toward the door from the corner of my eye i saw cynthia take a step after him pause then take another oh professor kennedy she called craig turned theres something i forgot she continued theres something wrong with mother she paused then resumed even before virginia was taken down with thisillness i saw a change she is worried oh professor kennedy what is it we have all been so happy and nowvirgie motherall i have in the world what shall i do just what do you mean asked kennedy gently i dont know mother has been so different lately and now every night she goes out where encouraged kennedy realising that his plan was working i dont know if she would only come back looking happier she was sobbing convulsively over she knew not what miss blakeley said kennedy taking her hand between both of his only trust me if it is in my power i shall bring you all out of this uncertainty that haunts you she could only murmur her thanks as we left it is strange ruminated kennedy as we sped across the city again to the laboratory we must watch mrs blakeley that was all that was said although i had no inkling of what was back of it all i felt quite satisfied at having recognised the mystery even on stumbling on it as i had in the laboratory as soon as he could develop the skiagraphs he had taken kennedy began a minute study of them it was not long before he looked over at me with the expression i had come to recognise when he found something important i went over and looked at the radiograph which he was studying to me it was nothing but successive gradations of shadows but to one who had studied roentgenography as kennedy had each minute gradation of light and shade had its meaning you see pointed out kennedy tracing along one of the shadows with a finepointed pencil and then along a corresponding position on another standard skiagraph which he already had there is a marked diminution in size of the sella turcica as it is called yet there is no evidence of a tumour for several moments he pondered deeply over the photographs and it is impossible to conceive of any mechanical pressure sufficient to cause such a change he added unable to help him on the problem whatever it might be i watched him pacing up and down the laboratory i shall have to take that picture over againunder different circumstances he remarked finally pausing and looking at his watch tonight we must follow this clue which cynthia has given us call a cab walter we took a stand down the block from the blakeley mansion near a large apartment where the presence of a cab would not attract attention if there is any job i despise it is shadowing one must keep his eyes riveted on a house for once let the attention relax and it is incredible how quickly any one may get out and disappear our vigil was finally rewarded when we saw mrs blakeley emerge and hurry down the street to follow her was easy for she did not suspect that she was being watched and went afoot on she walked turning off the drive and proceeding rapidly toward the region of cheap tenements she paused before one and as our cab cruised leisurely past we saw her press a button the last on the righthand side enter the door and start up the stairs instantly kennedy signalled our driver to stop and together we hopped out and walked back cautiously entering the vestibule the name in the letter box was mrs reba rinehart what could it mean just then another cab stopped up the street and as we turned to leave the vestibule kennedy drew back it was too late however not to be seen a man had just alighted and in turn had started back also realising that it was too late it was chapelle there was nothing to do but to make the best of it shadowing the shadowers queried kennedy keenly watching the play of his features under the arclight of the street miss cynthia asked me to follow her mother the other night he answered quite frankly and i have been doing so ever since it was a glib answer at any rate i thought then perhaps you know something of reba rinehart too bluffed kennedy chapelle eyed us a moment in doubt how much we knew kennedy played a pair of deuces as if they had been four aces instead not much replied chapelle dubiously i know that mrs blakeley has been paying money to the old woman who seems to be ill once i managed to get in to see her its a bad case of pernicious anemia i should say a neighbour told me she had been to the college hospital had been one of doctor hayness cases but that he had turned her over to his son ive seen hampton haynes here too there was an air of sincerity about chapelles words but then i reflected that there had also been a similar ring to what we had heard hampton say were they playing a game against each other perhapsbut what was the game what did it all mean and why should mrs blakeley pay money to an old woman a charity patient there was no solution both kennedy and chapelle by a sort of tacit consent dismissed their cabs and we strolled on over toward broadway watching one another furtively we parted finally and craig and i went up to our apartment where he sat for hours in a brown study there was plenty to think about even so far in the affair he may have sat up all night at any rate he roused me early in the morning come over to the laboratory he said i want to take that xray machine up there again to blakeleys confound it i hope its not too late i lost no time in joining him and we were at the house long before any reasonable hour for visitors kennedy asked for mrs blakeley and hurriedly set up the xray apparatus i wish you would place that face mask which she was wearing exactly as it was before she became ill he asked her mother did as kennedy directed replacing the rubber mask as virginia had worn it i want you to preserve that mask directed kennedy as he finished taking his pictures say nothing about it to any one in fact i should advise putting it in your family safe for the present hastily we drove back to the laboratory and kennedy set to work again developing the second set of skiagraphs i had not long to wait this time for him to study them his first glance brought me over to him as he exclaimed loudly at the point just opposite the sore which he had observed on virginias forehead and overlying the sella turcica there was a peculiar spot on the radiograph something in that mask has affected the photographic plate he explained his face now animated before i could ask him what it was he had opened a cabinet where he kept many new things which he studied in his leisure moments from it i saw him take several glass ampoules which he glanced at hastily and shoved into his pocket as we heard a footstep out in the hall it was chapelle very much worried could it be that he knew his society clientele was at stake i wondered or was it more than that shes dead he cried the old lady died last night without a word kennedy hustled us out of the laboratory stuffing the xray pictures into his pocket also as we went as we hurried downtown chapelle told us how he had tried to keep a watch by bribing one of the neighbours who had just informed him of the tragedy it was her heart said one of the neighbours as we entered the poor apartment the doctor said so anaemia insisted chapelle looking carefully at the body kennedy bent over also and examined the poor worn frame as he did so he caught sight of a heavy linen envelope tucked under her pillow he pulled it out gently and opened it inside were several timeworn documents and letters he glanced over them hastily unfolding first a letter walter he whispered furtively looking at the neighbours in the room and making sure that none of them had seen the envelope already read these thats her story one glance was sufficient the first was a letter from old stuart blakeley reba rinehart had been secretly married to himand never divorced one paper after another unfolded her story i thought quickly then she had had a right in the blakeley millions more than that the blakeleys themselves had none at least only what came to them by blakeleys will i read on to see what if any contest she had intended to make and as i read i could picture old stuart blakeley to myselfstrong direct unscrupulous a man who knew what he wanted and got it dominant closemouthed mysterious he had understood and estimated the future of new york on that he had founded his fortune according to the old ladys story the marriage was a complete secret she had demanded marriage when he had demanded her he had pointed out the difficulties the original property had come to him and would remain in his hands only on condition that he married one of his own faith she was not of the faith and declined to become so there had been other family reasons also they had been married with the idea of keeping it secret until he could arrange his affairs so that he could safely acknowledge her it was according to her story a ruse when she demanded recognition he replied that the marriage was invalid that the minister had been unfrocked before the ceremony she was not in law his wife and had no claim he asserted but he agreed to compromise in spite of it all if she would go west and not return or intrude he would make a cash settlement disillusioned she took the offer and went to california somehow he understood that she was dead years later he married again meanwhile she had invested her settlement had prospered had even married herself thinking the first marriage void then her second husband died and evil times came blakeley was dead but she came east since then she had been fighting to establish the validity of the first marriage and hence her claim to dower rights it was a moving story as we finished reading kennedy gathered the papers together and took charge of them taking chapelle who by this time was in a high state of excitement over both the death and the discovery kennedy hurried to the blakeley mansion stopping only long enough to telephone to doctor haynes and his son evidently the news had spread cynthia blakeley met us in the hall half frightened yet much relieved oh professor kennedy she cried i dont know what it is but mother seems so different what is it all about as kennedy said nothing she turned to chapelle whom i was watching narrowly what is it carl she whispered ii cant tell he whispered back guardedly then with an anxious glance at the rest of us is your sister any better cynthias face clouded relieved though she was about her mother there was still that horror for virginia come i interrupted not wishing to let chapelle get out of my sight yet wishing to follow kennedy who had dashed upstairs i found craig already at the bedside of virginia he had broken one of the ampoules and was injecting some of the extract in it into the sleeping girls arm mrs blakeley bent over eagerly as he did so even in her manner she was changed there was anxiety for virginia yet but one could feel that a great weight seemed to be lifted from her so engrossed was i in watching kennedy that i did not hear doctor haynes and hampton enter chapelle heard however and turned for a moment he gazed at hampton then with a slight curl of the lip he said in a low tone is it strictly ethical to treat a patient for disease of the heart when she is suffering from anaemiaif you have an interest in the life and death of the patient i watched hamptons face closely there was indignation in every line of it but before he could reply doctor haynes stepped forward my son was right in the diagnosis he almost shouted shaking a menacing finger at chapelle to come to the point sir explain that mark on miss virginias forehead yes demanded hampton also taking a step toward the beauty doctor explain itif you dare cynthia suppressed a little cry of fear for a moment i thought that the two young men would forget everything in the heat of their feelings just a second interposed kennedy quickly stepping between them let me do the talking there was something commanding about his tone as he looked from one to the other of us the trouble with miss virginia he added deliberately seems to lie in one of what the scientists have lately designated the endocrine glandsin this case the pituitary my xray pictures show that conclusively let me explain for the benefit of the rest the pituitary is an oval glandular body composed of two lobes and a connecting area which rest in the sella turcica enveloped by a layer of tissue about under this point he indicated the red spot on her forehead as he spoke it is as the early french surgeons called it iorgane enigmatique the ancients thought it discharged the pituita or mucus into the nose most scientists of the past century asserted that it was a vestigial relic of prehistoric usefulness today we know better one by one the functions of the internal secretions are being discovered our variously acquired bits of information concerning the ductless glands lie before us like the fragments of a modern picture puzzle and so i may tell you in connection with recent experimental studies in the role of the pituitary doctor gushing and other collaborators at johns hopkins have noticed a marked tendency to pass into a profoundly lethargic state when the secretion of the pituitary is totally or nearly so removed kennedy now had every eye riveted on him as he deftly led the subject straight to the case of the poor girl before us this he added with a wave of his hand toward her is much like what is called the frohlich syndromethe lethargy the subnormal temperature slow pulse and respiration lowered blood pressure and insensitivity the growth of fat and the loss of sex characteristics it has a namedystrophia adiposogenitalis he nodded to doctor haynes but did not pause this case bears a striking resemblance to the pronounced natural somnolence of hibernation and induced hypopituitarismunder activity of the glandproduces a result just like natural hibernation hibernation has nothing to do with winter or with food primarily it is connected in some way with this little gland under the forehead as the pituitary secretion is lessened the blocking action of the fatigue products in the body becomes greater and morbid somnolence sets in there is a high tolerance of carbohydrates which are promptly stored as fat i am surprised doctor haynes that you did not recognise the symptoms a murmur from mrs blakeley cut short doctor hayness reply i thought i noticed a movement of the still face on the white bed virgie virgie called mrs blakeley dropping on her knee beside her daughter im heremother virginias eyes opened ever so slightly her face turned just an inch or two she seemed to be making a great effort but it lasted only a moment then she slipped back into the strange condition that had baffled skilled physicians and surgeons for nearly a week the sleep is being dispelled said kennedy quietly placing his hand on mrs blakeleys shoulder it is a sort of semiconsciousness now and the improvement should soon be great and that i asked touching the empty ampoule from which he had injected the contents into her pituitrinthe extract of the anterior lobe of the pituitary body some one who had an object in removing her temporarily probably counted on restoring her to her former blooming womanhood by pituitrinand by removing the cause of the trouble kennedy reached into his pocket and drew forth the second xray photograph he had taken mrs blakeley may i trouble you to get that beauty mask which your daughter wore mechanically mrs blakeley obeyed i expected chapelle to object but not a word broke the deathlike stillness the narcolepsy continued kennedy taking the mask was due i find to something that affected the pituitary gland i have here a photograph of her taken when she was wearing the mask he ran his finger lightly over the part just above the eyes feel that little lump walter he directed i did so it was almost imperceptible but there was something what is it i asked located in one of the best protected and most inaccessible parts of the body kennedy considered slowly how could the pituitary be reached if you will study my skiagraph you will see how i got my first clue there was something over that spot which caused the refractory sore what was it radiumcarefully placed in the mask with guards of lead foil in such a way as to protect the eyes but direct the emission full at the gland which was to be affected and the secretions stopped chapelle gave a gasp he was pale and agitated some of you have already heard of reba rinehart shot out kennedy suddenly changing the subject mrs blakeley could not have been more astounded if a bomb had dropped before her still kneeling before virginias bed she turned her startled face at kennedy clasping her hands in appeal it was for my girls that i tried to buy her offfor their good nametheir fortunetheir future she cried imploringly kennedy bent down i know that is all he reassured then facing us went on behind that old woman was a secret of romantic interest she was contemplating filing suit in the courts to recover a widows interest in the land on which now stand the homes of millionaires hotel palaces luxurious apartments and popular theatresmillions of dollars worth of property cynthia moved over and drew her arms about the convulsed figure of her mother some one else knew of this old marriage of stuart blakeley proceeded kennedy knew of reba rinehart knew that she might die at any moment but until she died none of the blakeleys could be entirely sure of their fortune it flashed over me that chapelle might have conceived the whole scheme seeking to gain the entire fortune for cynthia who was interested enough to plot this postponement of the wedding until the danger to the fortune was finally removed i caught sight of hampton haynes his eyes riveted on the face on the bed before us virginia stirred again this time her eyes opened wider as if in a dream she caught sight of the face of her lover and smiled wanly could it have been hampton it seemed incredible the old lady is dead pursued kennedy tensely her dower right died with her nothing can be gained by bringing her case back againexcept to trouble the blakeleys in what is rightfully theirs gathering up the beauty mask the xray photographs and the papers of mrs rinehart kennedy emphasized with them the words as he whipped them out suddenly postponing the marriage at the possible expense of chapelle until reba rinehart was dead and trusting to a wrong diagnosis and hamptons inexperience as the surest way of bringing that result about quickly it was your inordinate ambition for your son doctor haynes that led you on i shall hold these proofs until virginia blakeley is restored completely to health and beauty susan glaspell susan glaspell was not only a pulitzer prizewinning playwright but a novelist and writer of short stories that established her as an important writer of localcolour fiction born in davenport iowa she relied on her midwestern roots to nurture a writing career that took her to provincetown massachusetts where she founded the provincetown players with eugene oneill to new york city s greenwich village and to greece always a woman ahead of her time glaspell graduated from davenport public schools and drake university in des moines iowa she served for two years as a court and legislative reporter for the des moines daily news before turning to writing for womens magazines fulltime in her short stories for such publications as good housekeeping and womens home companion were set in the fictional town of freeport iowa which she based on her home town of davenport her work treated romantic problems in a formula that incorporated setting the problem flashbacks obstacles overcome and a happy ending she also set out consciously to record the unique qualities of her region including the strengths and failings of people who came of pioneer stock but possessed a smalltown mentality after glaspell met and married george cram cook a welltodo rebel against davenport s smalltown pretensions her work began to incorporate politically idealist overtones including pacifist and socialist views she moved away from the localcolour traditions emphasis on sentimentality and began to employ realism to discuss more contemporary themes from to glaspell wrote seven oneact and four fulllength plays including the oneact play trifles which she rewrote as the short story a jury of her peers the plot is based on an actual case that glaspell covered as a reporter in des moines involving an abusive husband a jury of her peers is a strong example of writing that transcends localcolour conventions to become a classic of realism here glaspell demonstrates how the straightforward delivery of dialogue in ordinary voices can make a poignant and powerful point the carefully drawn setting is one of the earliest examples of regional writing in a genre that now thrives on the enrichment of formula with descriptions of distinctly american environments a jury of her peers when martha hale opened the stormdoor and got a cut of the north wind she ran back for her big woollen scarf as she hurriedly wound that round her head her eye made a scandalised sweep of her kitchen it was no ordinary thing that called her awayit was probably farther from ordinary than anything that had ever happened in dickson county but what her eye took in was that her kitchen was in no shape for leaving her bread all ready for mixing half the flour sifted and half unsifted she hated to see things half done but she had been at that when the team from town stopped to get mr hale and then the sheriff came running in to say his wife wished mrs hale would come tooadding with a grin that he guessed she was getting scary and wanted another woman along so she had dropped everything right where it was martha now came her husbands impatient voice dont keep folks waiting out here in the cold she again opened the stormdoor and this time joined the three men and the one woman waiting for her in the big twoseated buggy after she had the robes tucked around her she took another look at the woman who sat beside her on the back seat she had met mrs peters the year before at the county fair and the thing she remembered about her was that she didnt seem like a sheriffs wife she was small and thin and didnt have a strong voice mrs gorman sheriffs wife before gorman went out and peters came in had a voice that somehow seemed to be backing up the law with every word but if mrs peters didnt look like a sheriffs wife peters made it up in looking like a sheriff he was to a dot the kind of man who could get himself elected sheriffa heavy man with a big voice who was particularly genial with the lawabiding as if to make it plain that he knew the difference between criminals and noncriminals and right there it came into mrs hales mind with a stab that this man who was so pleasant and lively with all of them was going to the wrights now as a sheriff the countrys not very pleasant this time of year mrs peters at last ventured as if she felt they ought to be talking as well as the men mrs hale scarcely finished her reply for they had gone up a little hill and could see the wright place now and seeing it did not make her feel like talking it looked very lonesome this cold march morning it had always been a lonesomelooking place it was down in a hollow and the poplar trees around it were lonesomelooking trees the men were looking at it and talking about what had happened the county attorney was bending to one side of the buggy and kept looking steadily at the place as they drew up to it im glad you came with me mrs peters said nervously as the two women were about to follow the men in through the kitchen door even after she had her foot on the doorstep her hand on the knob martha hale had a moment of feeling she could not cross the threshold and the reason it seemed she couldnt cross it now was simply because she hadnt crossed it before time and time again it had been in her mind i ought to go over and see minnie fostershe still thought of her as minnie foster though for twenty years she had been mrs wright and then there was always something to do and minnie foster would go from her mind but now she could come the men went over to the stove the women stood close together by the door young henderson the county attorney turned around and said come up to the fire ladies mrs peters took a step forward then stopped im notcold she said and so the two women stood by the door at first not even so much as looking around the kitchen the men talked for a minute about what a good thing it was the sheriff had sent his deputy out that morning to make a fire for them and then sheriff peters stepped back from the stove unbuttoned his outer coat and leaned his hands on the kitchen table in a way that seemed to mark the beginning of official business now mr hale he said in a sort of semiofficial voice before we move things about you tell mr henderson just what it was you saw when you came here yesterday morning the county attorney was looking around the kitchen by the way he said has anything been moved he turned to the sheriff are things just as you left them yesterday peters looked from cupboard to sink from that to a small worn rocker a little to one side of the kitchen table its just the same somebody should have been left here yesterday said the county attorney ohyesterday returned the sheriff with a little gesture as of yesterday having been more than he could bear to think of when i had to send frank to morris centre for that man who went crazylet me tell you i had my hands full yesterday i knew you could get back from omaha by today george and as long as i went over everything here myself well mr hale said the county attorney in a way of letting what was past and gone go tell just what happened when you came here yesterday morning mrs hale still leaning against the door had that sinking feeling of the mother whose child is about to speak a piece lewis often wandered along and got things mixed up in a story she hoped he would tell this straight and plain and not say unnecessary things that would just make things harder for minnie foster he didnt begin at once and she noticed that he looked queeras if standing in that kitchen and having to tell what he had seen there yesterday morning made him almost sick yes mr hale the county attorney reminded harry and i had started to town with a load of potatoes mrs hales husband began harry was mrs hales oldest boy he wasnt with them now for the very good reason that those potatoes never got to town yesterday and he was taking them this morning so he hadnt been home when the sheriff stopped to say he wanted mr hale to come over to the wright place and tell the county attorney his story there where he could point it all out with all mrs hales other emotions came the fear that maybe harry wasnt dressed warm enoughthey hadnt any of them realised how that north wind did bite we come along this road hale was going on with a motion of his hand to the road over which they had just come and as we got in sight of the house i says to harry im goin to see if i cant get john wright to take a telephone you see he explained to henderson unless i can get somebody to go in with me they wont come out this branch road except for a price i cant pay id spoke to wright about it once before but he put me off saying folks talked too much anyway and all he asked was peace and quietguess you know about how much he talked himself but i thought maybe if i went to the house and talked about it before his wife and said all the womenfolks liked the telephones and that in this lonesome stretch of road it would be a good thingwell i said to harry that that was what i was going to saythough i said at the same time that i didnt know as what his wife wanted made much difference to john now there he wassaying things he didnt need to say mrs hale tried to catch her husbands eye but fortunately the county attorney interrupted with lets talk about that a little later mr hale i do want to talk about that but im anxious now to get along to just what happened when you got here when he began this time it was very deliberately and carefully i didnt see or hear anything i knocked at the door and still it was all quiet inside i knew they must be upit was past eight oclock so i knocked again louder and i thought i heard somebody say come in i wasnt sureim not sure yet but i opened the doorthis door jerking a hand toward the door by which the two women stood and there in that rockerpointing to itsat mrs wright every one in the kitchen looked at the rocker it came into mrs hales mind that that rocker didnt look in the least like minnie fosterthe minnie foster of twenty years before it was a dingy red with wooden rungs up the back and the middle rung was gone and the chair sagged to one side how did shelook the county attorney was inquiring well said hale she lookedqueer how do you meanqueer as he asked it he took out a notebook and pencil mrs hale did not like the sight of that pencil she kept her eye fixed on her husband as if to keep him from saying unnecessary things that would go into that notebook and make trouble hale did speak guardedly as if the pencil had affected him too well as if she didnt know what she was going to do next and kind ofdone up how did she seem to feel about your coming why i dont think she mindedone way or other she didnt pay much attention i said ho do mrs wright its cold aint it and she said is it and went on pleatin at her apron well i was surprised she didnt ask me to come up to the stove or to sit down but just set there not even lookin at me and so i said i want to see john and then shelaughed i guess you would call it a laugh i thought of harry and the team outside so i said a little sharp can i see john no says shekind of dull like aint he home says i then she looked at me yes says she hes home then why cant i see him i asked her out of patience with her now cause hes dead says she just as quiet and dulland fell to pleatin her apron dead says i like you do when you cant take in what youve heard she just nodded her head not getting a bit excited but rockin back and forth whywhere is he says i not knowing what to say she just pointed upstairslike thispointing to the room above i got up with the idea of going up there myself by this time ididnt know what to do i walked from there to here then i says why what did he die of he died of a rope around his neck says she and just went on pleatin at her apron hale stopped speaking and stood staring at the rocker as if he were still seeing the woman who had sat there the morning before nobody spoke it was as if every one were seeing the woman who had sat there the morning before and what did you do then the county attorney at last broke the silence i went out and called harry i thought i mightneed help i got harry in and we went upstairs his voice fell almost to a whisper there he waslying over the i think id rather have you go into that upstairs the county attorney interrupted where you can point it all out just go on now with the rest of the story well my first thought was to get that rope off it looked he stopped his face twitching but harry he went up to him and he said no hes dead all right and wed better not touch anything so we went downstairs she was still sitting that same way has anybody been notified i asked no says she unconcerned who did this mrs wright said harry he said it businesslike and she stopped pleatin at her apron i dont know she says you dont know says harry werent you sleepin in the bed with him yes says she but i was on the inside somebody slipped a rope round his neck and strangled him and you didnt wake up says harry i didnt wake up she said after him we may have looked as if we didnt see how that could be for after a minute she said i sleep sound harry was going to ask her more questions but i said maybe that werent our business maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to the coroner or the sheriff so harry went fast as he could over to high roadthe rivers place where theres a telephone and what did she do when she knew you had gone for the coroner the attorney got his pencil in his hand all ready for writing she moved from that chair to this one over herehale pointed to a small chair in the cornerand just sat there with her hands held together and looking down i got a feeling that i ought to make some conversation so i said i had come in to see if john wanted to put in a telephone and at that she started to laugh and then she stopped and looked at mescared at the sound of a moving pencil the man who was telling the story looked up i dunnomaybe it wasnt scared he hastened i wouldnt like to say it was soon harry got back and then dr lloyd came and you mr peters and so i guess thats all i know that you dont he said that last with relief and moved a little as if relaxing every one moved a little the county attorney walked toward the stair door i guess well go upstairs firstthen out to the barn and around there he paused and looked around the kitchen youre convinced there was nothing important here he asked the sheriff nothing that would point to any motive the sheriff too looked all around as if to reconvince himself nothing here but kitchen things he said with a little laugh for the insignificance of kitchen things the county attorney was looking at the cupboarda peculiar ungainly structure half closet and half cupboard the upper part of it being built in the wall and the lower part just the oldfashioned kitchen cupboard as if its queerness attracted him he got a chair and opened the upper part and looked in after a moment he drew his hand away sticky heres a nice mess he said resentfully the two women had drawn nearer and now the sheriffs wife spoke ohher fruit she said looking to mrs hale for sympathetic understanding she turned back to the county attorney and explained she worried about that when it turned so cold last night she said the fire would go out and her jars might burst mrs peterss husband broke into a laugh well can you beat the women held for murder and worrying about her preserves the young attorney set his lips i guess before were through with her she may have something more serious than preserves to worry about oh well said mrs hales husband with goodnatured superiority women are used to worrying over trifles the two women moved a little closer together neither of them spoke the county attorney seemed suddenly to remember his mannersand think of his future and yet said he with the gallantry of a young politician for all their worries what would we do without the ladies the women did not speak did not unbend he went to the sink and began washing his hands he turned to wipe them on the roller towelwhirled it for a cleaner place dirty towels not much of a housekeeper would you say ladies he kicked his foot against some dirty pans under the sink theres a great deal of work to be done on a farm said mrs hale stiffly to be sure and yetwith a little bow to heri know there are some dickson county farmhouses that do not have such roller towels he gave it a pull to expose its full length again those towels get dirty awful quick mens hands arent always as clean as they might be ah loyal to your sex i see he laughed he stopped and gave her a keen look but you and mrs wright were neighbours i suppose you were friends too martha hale shook her head ive seen little enough of her of late years ive not been in this houseits more than a year and why was that you didnt like her i liked her well enough she replied with spirit farmers wives have their hands full mr henderson and thenshe looked around the kitchen yes he encouraged it never seemed a very cheerful place said she more to herself than to him no he agreed i dont think any one could call it cheerful i shouldnt say she had the homemaking instinct well i dont know as wright had either she muttered you mean they didnt get on very well he was quick to ask no i dont mean anything she answered with decision as she turned a little away from him she added but i dont think a place would be any the cheerfuler for john wrights bein in it id like to talk to you about that a little later mrs hale he said im anxious to get the lay of things upstairs now he moved toward the stair door followed by the two men i suppose anything mrs peters doesll be all right the sheriff inquired she was to take in some clothes for her you knowand a few little things we left in such a hurry yesterday the county attorney looked at the two women whom they were alone there among the kitchen things yesmrs peters he said his glance resting on the woman who was not mrs peters the big farmer woman who stood behind the sheriffs wife of course mrs peters is one of us he said in a manner of entrusting responsibility and keep your eye out mrs peters for anything that might be of use no telling you women might come upon a clue to the motiveand thats the thing we need mr hale rubbed his face after the fashion of a show man getting ready for a pleasantry but would the women know a clue if they did come upon it he said and having delivered himself of this he followed the others through the stair door the women stood motionless and silent listening to the footsteps first upon the stairs then in the room above them then as if releasing herself from something strange mrs hale began to arrange the dirty pans under the sink which the county attorneys disdainful push of the foot had deranged id hate to have men comin into my kitchen she said testilysnoopin around and criticisin of course its no more than their duty said the sheriffs wife in her manner of timid acquiescence dutys all right replied mrs hale bluffly but i guess that deputy sheriff that come out to make the fire might have got a little of this on she gave the roller towel a pull wish id thought of that sooner seems mean to talk about her for not having things slicked up when she had to come away in such a hurry she looked around the kitchen certainly it was not slicked up her eye was held by a bucket of sugar on a low shelf the cover was off the wooden bucket and beside it was a paper baghalf full mrs hale moved toward it she was putting this in here she said to herselfslowly she thought of the flour in her kitchen at homehalf sifted half not sifted she had been interrupted and had left things half done what had interrupted minnie foster why had that work been left half done she made a move as if to finish itunfinished things always bothered herand then she glanced around and saw that mrs peters was watching herand she didnt want mrs peters to get that feeling she had got of work begun and thenfor some reasonnot finished its a shame about her fruit she said and walked toward the cupboard that the county attorney had opened and got on the chair murmuring i wonder if its all gone it was a sorry enough looking sight but heres one thats all right she said at last she held it toward the light this is cherries too she looked again i declare i believe thats the only one with a sigh she got down from the chair went to the sink and wiped off the bottle shell feel awful bad after all her hard work in the hot weather i remember the afternoon i put up my cherries last summer she set the bottle on the table and with another sigh started to sit down in the rocker but she did not sit down something kept her from sitting down in that chair she straightenedstepped back and half turned away stood looking at it seeing the woman who sat there pleatin at her apron the thin voice of the sheriffs wife broke in upon her i must be getting those things from the front room closet she opened the door into the other room started in stepped back you coming with me mrs hale she asked nervously youyou could help me get them they were soon backthe stark coldness of that shutup room was not a thing to linger in my said mrs peters dropping the things on the table and hurrying to the stove mrs hale stood examining the clothes the woman who was being detained in town had said she wanted wright was close she exclaimed holding up a shabby black skirt that bore the marks of much making over i think maybe thats why she kept so much to herself i spose she felt she couldnt do her part and then you dont enjoy things when you feel shabby she used to wear pretty clothes and be livelywhen she was minnie foster one of the town girls singing in the choir but thatoh that was twenty years ago with a carefulness in which there was something tender she folded the shabby clothes and piled them at one corner of the table she looked at mrs peters and there was something in the other womans look that irritated her she dont care she said to herself much difference it makes to her whether minnie foster had pretty clothes when she was a girl then she looked again and she wasnt so sure in fact she hadnt at any time been perfectly sure about mrs peters she had that shrinking manner and yet her eyes looked as if they could see a long way into things this all you was to take in asked mrs hale no said the sheriffs wife she said she wanted an apron funny thing to want she ventured in her nervous little way for theres not much to get you dirty in jail goodness knows but i suppose just to make her feel more natural if youre used to wearing an apron she said they were in the bottom drawer of this cupboard yeshere they are and then her little shawl that always hung on the stair door she took the small gray shawl from behind the door leading upstairs and stood a minute looking at it suddenly mrs hale took a quick step toward the other woman mrs peters yes mrs hale do you think shedid it a frightened look blurred the other things in mrs peterss eyes oh i dont know she said in a voice that seemed to shrink away from the subject well i dont think she did affirmed mrs hale stoutly asking for an apron and her little shawl worryin about her fruit mr peters says footsteps were heard in the room above she stopped looked up then went on in a lowered voice mr peters saysit looks bad for her mr henderson is awful sarcastic in a speech and hes going to make fun of her saying she didntwake up for a moment mrs hale had no answer then well i guess john wright didnt wake upwhen they was slippin that rope under his neck she muttered no its strange breathed mrs peters they think it was such a funny way to kill a man she began to laugh at the sound of the laugh abruptly stopped thats just what mr hale said said mrs hale in a resolutely natural voice there was a gun in the house he says thats what he cant understand mr henderson said coming out that what was needed for the case was a motive something to show angeror sudden feeling well i dont see any signs of anger around here said mrs hale i dont she stopped it was as if her mind tripped on something her eye was caught by a dishtowel in the middle of the kitchen table slowly she moved toward the table one half of it was wiped clean the other half messy her eyes made a slow almost unwilling turn to the bucket of sugar and the half empty bag beside it things begunand not finished after a moment she stepped back and said in that manner of releasing herself wonder how theyre finding things upstairs i hope she had it a little more red up there you knowshe paused and feeling gatheredit seems kind of sneaking locking her up in town and coming out here to get her own house to turn against her but mrs hale said the sheriffs wife the law is the law i spose tis answered mrs hale shortly she turned to the stove saying something about that fire not being much to brag of she worked with it a minute and when she straightened up she said aggressively the law is the lawand a bad stove is a bad stove howd you like to cook on thispointing with the poker to the broken lining she opened the oven door and started to express her opinion of the oven but she was swept into her own thoughts thinking of what it would mean year after year to have that stove to wrestle with the thought of minnie foster trying to bake in that ovenand the thought of her never going over to see minnie foster she was startled by hearing mrs peters say a person gets discouragedand loses heart the sheriffs wife had looked from the stove to the sinkto the pail of water which had been carried in from outside the two women stood there silent above them the footsteps of the men who were looking for evidence against the woman who had worked in that kitchen that look of seeing into things of seeing through a thing to something else was in the eyes of the sheriffs wife now when mrs hale next spoke to her it was gently better loosen up your things mrs peters well not feel them when we go out mrs peters went to the back of the room to hang up the fur tippet she was wearing a moment later she exclaimed why she was piecing a quilt and held up a large sewing basket piled high with quilt pieces mrs hale spread some of the blocks on the table its logcabin pattern she said putting several of them together pretty isnt it they were so engaged with the quilt that they did not hear the footsteps on the stairs just as the stair door opened mrs hale was saying do you suppose she was going to quilt it or just knot it the sheriff threw up his hands they wonder whether she was going to quilt it or just knot it there was a laugh for the ways of women a warming of hands over the stove and then the county attorney said briskly well lets go right out to the barn and get that cleared up i dont see as theres anything so strange mrs hale said resentfully after the outside door had closed on the three menour taking up our time with little things while were waiting for them to get the evidence i dont see as its anything to laugh about of course theyve got awful important things on their minds said the sheriffs wife apologetically they returned to an inspection of the blocks for the quilt mrs hale was looking at the fine even sewing and preoccupied with thoughts of the woman who had done that sewing when she heard the sheriffs wife say in a queer tone why look at this one she turned to take the block held out to her the sewing said mrs peters in a troubled way all the rest of them have been so nice and evenbutthis one why it looks as if she didnt know what she was about their eyes metsomething flashed to life passed between them then as if with an effort they seemed to pull away from each other a moment mrs hale sat there her hands folded over that sewing which was so unlike all the rest of the sewing then she had pulled a knot and drawn the threads oh what are you doing mrs hale asked the sheriffs wife startled just pulling out a stitch or two thats not sewed very good said mrs hale mildly i dont think we ought to touch things mrs peters said a little helplessly ill just finish up this end answered mrs hale still in that mild matteroffact fashion she threaded a needle and started to replace bad sewing with good for a little while she sewed in silence then in that thin timid voice she heard mrs hale yes mrs peters what do you suppose she was sonervous about oh i dont know said mrs hale as if dismissing a thing not important enough to spend much time on i dont know as she wasnervous i sew awful queer sometimes when im just tired she cut a thread and out of the corner of her eye looked up at mrs peters the small lean face of the sheriffs wife seemed to have tightened up her eyes had that look of peering into something but the next moment she moved and said in her thin indecisive way well i must get those clothes wrapped they may be through sooner than we think i wonder where i could find a piece of paper and string in that cupboard maybe suggested mrs hale after a glance around one piece of the crazy sewing remained unripped mrs peterss back turned martha hale now scrutinised that piece compared it with the dainty accurate sewing of the other blocks the difference was startling holding this block made her feel queer as if the distracted thoughts of the woman who had perhaps turned to it to try and quiet herself were communicating themselves to her mrs peterss voice roused her heres a birdcage she said did she have a bird mrs hale why i dont know whether she did or not she turned to look at the cage mrs peters was holding up ive not been here in so long she sighed there was a man round last year selling canaries cheapbut i dont know as she took one maybe she did she used to sing real pretty herself mrs peters looked around the kitchen seems kind of funny to think of a bird here she half laughedan attempt to put up a barrier but she must have had oneor why would she have a cage i wonder what happened to it i suppose maybe the cat got it suggested mrs hale resuming her sewing no she didnt have a cat shes got that feeling some people have about catsbeing afraid of them when they brought her to our house yesterday my cat got in the room and she was real upset and asked me to take it out my sister bessie was like that laughed mrs hale the sheriffs wife did not reply the silence made mrs hale turn around mrs peters was examining the birdcage look at this door she said slowly its broke one hinge has been pulled apart mrs hale came nearer looks as if some one must have been rough with it again their eyes metstartled questioning apprehensive for a moment neither spoke nor stirred then mrs hale turning away said brusquely if theyre going to find any evidence i wish theyd be about it i dont like this place but im awful glad you came with me mrs hale mrs peters put the birdcage on the table and sat down it would be lonesome for mesitting here alone yes it would wouldnt it agreed mrs hale a certain determined naturalness in her voice she picked up the sewing but now it dropped in her lap and she murmured in a different voice but i tell you what i do wish mrs peters i wish i had come over sometimes when she was here i wishi had but of course you were awful busy mrs hale your houseand your children i couldve come retorted mrs hale shortly i stayed away because it werent cheerfuland thats why i ought to have come ishe looked aroundive never liked this place maybe because its down in a hollow and you dont see the road i dont know what it is but its a lonesome place and always was i wish i had come over to see minnie foster sometimes i can see now she did not put it into words well you mustnt reproach yourself counselled mrs peters somehow we just dont see how it is with other folks tillsomething comes up not having children makes less work mused mrs hale after a silence but it makes a quiet houseand wright out to work all dayand no company when he did come in did you know john wright mrs peters not to know him ive seen him in town they say he was a good man yesgood conceded john wrights neighbour grimly he didnt drink and kept his word as well as most i guess and paid his debts but he was a hard man mrs peters just to pass the time of day with him she stopped shivered a little like a raw wind that gets to the bone her eye fell upon the cage on the table before her and she added almost bitterly i should think she wouldve wanted a bird suddenly she leaned forward looking intently at the cage but what do you spose went wrong with it i dont know returned mrs peters unless it got sick and died but after she said it she reached over and swung the broken door both women watched it as if somehow held by it you didnt knowher mrs hale asked a gentler note in her voice not till they brought her yesterday said the sheriffs wife shecome to think of it she was kind of like a bird herself real sweet and pretty but kind of timid andfluttery howshedidchange that held her for a long time finally as if struck with a happy thought and relieved to get back to everyday things she exclaimed tell you what mrs peters why dont you take the quilt in with you it might take up her mind why i think thats a real nice idea mrs hale agreed the sheriffs wife as if she too were glad to come into the atmosphere of a simple kindness there couldnt possibly be any objection to that could there now just what will i take i wonder if her patches are in hereand her things they turned to the sewing basket heres some red said mrs hale bringing out a roll of cloth underneath that was a box here maybe her scissors are in hereand her things she held it up what a pretty box ill warrant that was something she had a long time agowhen she was a girl she held it in her hand a moment then with a little sigh opened it instantly her hand went to her nose why mrs peters drew nearerthen turned away theres something wrapped up in this piece of silk faltered mrs hale this isnt her scissors said mrs peters in a shrinking voice her hand not steady mrs hale raised the piece of silk oh mrs peters she cried its mrs peters bent closer its the bird she whispered but mrs peters cried mrs hale look at it its necklook at its neck its allother side to she held the box away from her the sheriffs wife again bent closer somebody wrung its neck said she in a voice that was slow and deep and then again the eyes of the two women metthis time clung together in a look of dawning comprehension of growing horror mrs peters looked from the dead bird to the broken door of the cage again their eyes met and just then there was a sound at the outside door mrs hale slipped the box under the quilt pieces in the basket and sank into the chair before it mrs peters stood holding to the table the county attorney and the sheriff came in from outside well ladies said the county attorney as one turning from serious things to little pleasantries have you decided whether she was going to quilt it or knot it we think began the sheriffs wife in a flurried voice that she was going toknot it he was too preoccupied to notice the change that came in her voice on that last well thats very interesting im sure he said tolerantly he caught sight of the birdcage has the bird flown we think the cat got it said mrs hale in a voice curiously even he was walking up and down as if thinking something out is there a cat he asked absently mrs hale shot a look up at the sheriffs wife well not now said mrs peters theyre superstitious you know they leave she sank into her chair the county attorney did not heed her no sign at all of any one having come in from the outside he said to peters in the manner of continuing an interrupted conversation their own rope now lets go upstairs again and go over it piece by piece it would have to have been some one who knew just the the stair door closed behind them and their voices were lost the two women sat motionless not looking at each other but as if peering into something and at the same time holding back when they spoke now it was as if they were afraid of what they were saying but as if they could not help saying it she liked the bird said martha hale low and slowly she was going to bury it in that pretty box when i was a girl said mrs peters under her breath my kittenthere was a boy took a hatchet and before my eyesbefore i could get there she covered her face an instant if they hadnt held me back i would haveshe caught herself looked upstairs where footsteps were heard and finished weaklyhurt him then they sat without speaking or moving i wonder how it would seem mrs hale at last began as if feeling her way over strange groundnever to have had any children around her eyes made a slow sweep of the kitchen as if seeing what that kitchen had meant through all the years no wright wouldnt like the bird she said after thata thing that sang she used to sing he killed that too her voice tightened mrs peters moved uneasily of course we dont know who killed the bird i knew john wright was mrs hales answer it was an awful thing was done in this house that night mrs hale said the sheriffs wife killing a man while he slept slipping a thing round his neck that choked the life out of him mrs hales hand went out to the birdcage his neck choked the life out of him we dont know who killed him whispered mrs peters wildly we dont know mrs hale had not moved if there had been years and years ofnothing then a bird to sing to you it would be awfulstill after the bird was still it was as if something within her not herself had spoken and it found in mrs peters something she did not know as herself i know what stillness is she said in a queer monotonous voice when we homesteaded in dakota and my first baby diedafter he was two years oldand me with no other then mrs hale stirred how soon do you suppose theyll be through looking for evidence i know what stillness is repeated mrs peters in just that same way then she too pulled back the law has got to punish crime mrs hale she said in her tight little way i wish youd seen minnie foster was the answer when she wore a white dress with blue ribbons and stood up there in the choir and sang the picture of that girl the fact that she had lived neighbour to that girl for twenty years and had let her die for lack of life was suddenly j more than she could bear oh i wish id come over here once in a while she cried that was a crime that was a crime whos going to punish that we mustnt take on said mrs peters with a frightened look toward the stairs i might a known she needed help i tell you its queer mrs peters we live close together and we live far apart we all go through the same thingsits all just a different kind of the same thing if it werentwhy do you and i understand why do we knowwhat we know this minute she dashed her hand across her eyes then seeing the jar of fruit on the table she reached for it and choked out if i was you i wouldnt tell her her fruit was gone tell her it aint tell her its all rightall of it heretake this in to prove it to her sheshe may never know whether it was broke or not she turned away mrs peters reached out for the bottle of fruit as if she were glad to take it as if touching a familiar thing having something to do could keep her from something else she got up looked about for something to wrap the fruit in took a petticoat from the pile of clothes she had brought from the front room and nervously started winding that round the bottle my she began in a high false voice its a good thing the men couldnt hear us getting all stirred up over a little thing like adead canary she hurried over that as if that could have anything to do withwithmy wouldnt they laugh footsteps were heard on the stairs maybe they would muttered mrs halemaybe they wouldnt no peters said the county attorney incisively its all perfectly clear except the reason for doing it but you know juries when it comes to women if there was some definite thingsomething to show something to make a story about a thing that would connect up with this clumsy way of doing it in a covert way mrs hale looked at mrs peters mrs peters was looking at her quickly they looked away from each other the outer door opened and mr hale came in ive got the team round now he said pretty cold out there im going to stay here awhile by myself the county attorney suddenly announced you can send frank out for me cant you he asked the sheriff i want to go over everything im not satisfied we cant do better again for one brief moment the two womens eyes found one another the sheriff came up to the table did you want to see what mrs peters was going to take in the county attorney picked up the apron he laughed oh i guess theyre not very dangerous things the ladies have picked out mrs hales hand was on the sewing basket in which the box was concealed she felt that she ought to take her hand off the basket she did not seem able to he picked up one of the quilt blocks which she had piled on to cover the box her eyes felt like fire she had a feeling that if he took up the basket she would snatch it from him but he did not take it up with another little laugh he turned away saying no mrs peters doesnt need supervising for that matter a sheriffs wife is married to the law ever think of it that way mrs peters mrs peters was standing beside the table mrs hale shot a look up at her but she could not see her face mrs peters had turned away when she spoke her voice was muffled notjust that way she said married to the law chuckled mrs peterss husband he moved toward the door into the front room and said to the county attorney i just want you to come in here a minute george we ought to take a look at these windows ohwindows said the county attorney scoffingly well be right out mr hale said the sheriff to the farmer who was still waiting by the door hale went to look after the horses the sheriff followed the county attorney into the other room againfor one momentthe two women were alone in that kitchen martha hale sprang up her hands tight together looking at that other woman with whom it rested at first she could not see her eyes for the sheriffs wife had not turned back since she turned away at that suggestion of being married to the law but now mrs hale made her turn back her eyes made her turn back slowly unwillingly mrs peters turned her head until her eyes met the eyes of the other woman there was a moment when they held each other in a steady burning look in which there was no evasion nor flinching then martha hales eyes pointed the way to the basket in which was hidden the thing that would make certain the conviction of the other womanthat woman who was not there and yet who had been there with them all through the hour for a moment mrs peters did not move and then she did it with a rush forward she threw back the quilt pieces got the box tried to put it in her handbag it was too big desperately she opened it started to take the bird out but there she brokeshe could not touch the bird she stood helpless foolish there was a sound of a knob turning in the inner door martha hale snatched the box from the sheriffs wife and got it in the pocket of her big coat just as the sheriff and the county attorney came back into the kitchen well henry said the county attorney facetiously at least we found out that she was not going to quilt it she was going towhat is it you call it ladies mrs hales hand was against the pocket of her coat we call itknot it mr henderson carroll john daly carroll john daly identified as the pioneer of the private eye is credited with creating the hardboiled detective daly demonstrates why he deserves that title in the false burton combs which is considered to be the genesis of the private eye in it daly defines the credo and personality not only of the unnamed protagonist in the story but also of his soontobecreated hero race williams the toughtalking hardboiled private eye of his own most successful series and a thousand who would follow the pattern the hero says i aint a crook just a gentleman adventurer and make my living working against the law breakers not that i work with the policeno not me he adds im no knight errant either anticipating how the hardboiled hero would be used by dashiell hammett and especially raymond chandler daly born in yonkers new york and a graduate of the american academy of dramatic arts had given up on an acting career become a movie projectionist and moved from that into ownership of a chain of movie theatres he didnt begin his writing career until the roaring twenties was in its third year and the tone of his tales exactly fits the american hedonism of the period in a sense daly took the moralistic white knight hero of the pulp westerns and converted him to fit the mood of a country turned cynical by world war i and by the official corruption that accompanied prohibition race williams declares that he makes his own ethics and his solutions are more likely to be accomplished with a pistol shot or a punch than with the sharp reasoning of the courtly sleuths who had preceded him his adventures are told in the first person allowing the reader at once to experience the physical sensations and inner thoughts of the hero two other hardboiled detectives created by daly vee brown and satan hall followed in the same formula in disclaiming any moral intentions and describing himself as a soldier of fortune the protagonist of the false burton combs sets the race williams pattern he also anticipates williamss attitude toward the establishment there aint nothing in government unless youre a politician and as i said before i aint a crook the hero also states that he never took women seriously my game and women dont go well together that attitude was often reflected in detective fiction of the s but while dalys male heroes disdain women the author is able to create the occasional exemplar of a woman who is clearly heroic strong female characters like the pretty game little kid marion st james whose courage is essential to the heros wellbeing were as unusual in dalys era as is the resolution of this remarkable story the false burton combs i had an outside stateroom on the upper deck of the fall river boat and ten minutes after i parked my bag there i knew that i was being watched the boat had already cleared and was slowly making its way toward the battery i didnt take the shadowing too seriously there was nothing to be nervous aboutmy little trip was purely a pleasure one this time but then a dick getting your smoke is not pleasant under the best of circumstances and yet i was sure i had come aboard unobserved this chap was a new one on me and i thought he must have just picked me up on suspiciontrailed along in the hope of getting something but i checked up my past offences and there was really nothing they could hold me on i aint a crook just a gentleman adventurer and make my living working against the law breakers not that i work with the policeno not me im no knight errant either it just came to me that the simplest people in the world are crooks they are so set on their own plans to fleece others that they never imagine that they are the simplest sort to do why the best safe cracker in the countrythe dread of the police of seven stateswill drop all his hardearned money in three weeks on the race track and many a wellthoughtof stickup man will turn out his wad in one evenings crap game get the game i guess im just one of the few that see how soft the lay is theres a lot of little stunts to tell about if i wanted to give away professional secrets but the games too good to spread broadcast its enough to say that ive been in card games with four sharpers and did the quartet at that i dont know a thing about cards and couldnt stack a deck if i was given half the night but as i say im an adventurer not the kind the name generally means those that sit around waiting for a sucker or spend their time helping governments out of trouble not that i aint willing to help governments at a certain price but none have asked me those kind of chaps are found between the pages of a book i guess i know i tried the game just once and nearly starved to death there aint nothing in governments unless youre a politician and as i said before i aint a crook ive done a lot of business in blackmail cases i find out a lad thats being blackmailed and then i visit him he pays me for my services and like as not we do the blackmailers every time you see im a kind of a fellow in the centrenot a crook and not a policeman both of them look on me with suspicion though the crooks dont often know im out after their hides and the policewell they run me pretty close at times but i got to take the chances but it aint a nice feeling to be trailed when youre out for pleasure so i trot about the deck a few times whistling just to be sure there wasnt any mistake and that bird come atramping after me as innocent as if it was his first job then i had dinner and he sits at the next table and eyes me with a wistful longing like he hadnt made a pinch in a long time and is just dying to lock somebody up but i study him too and he strikes me queer he aint got none of the earmarks of a dick he acts like a lad with money and orders without even looking at the prices and it comes to me that i may have him wrong and that he might be one of these fellows that wanted to sell me oil stock i always fall hard for the oil stock game there aint much in it but it passes the time and lets you eat well without paying for it along about nine oclock i am leaning over the rail just thinking and figuring how far the swim to shore is if a fellow had to do it not that i had any thought of taking to the waterno not mebut i always like to figure what the chances are you never can tell well that bird with the longing eyes cuddles right up and leans over the rail alongside of me its a nice night he says a first rate night for a swim i looked him over carefully out of the corner of my eyes he sort of straightens up and looks out toward the flickering shore lights it is a long swim he says just like he had the idea in mind then he asks me to have a cigar and its a quarter one and i take it i wonder would you do me a favour he says after a bit this was about what i expected con men are full of that kind of gush hmmm is all i get off my game is a waiting one i came aboard a bit late he goes right on i couldnt get a roomnow i wonder would you let me take the upper berth in yours i have been kind of watching you and saw that you were all alone kind of watching me was right and now he wanted to share my room well that dont exactly appeal to me for im banking on a good nights sleep besides i know that the story is fishy for i bought my room aboard and got an outsider but i dont tell him that right off i think ill work him out a bit first im a friend of the purser i tell him ill get you a room and i make to pass him nodont do that he takes me by the arm it isnt that isnt what i look him straight in the eyes and theres a look there that i have seen before and comes in my line of business as he half turned and i caught the reflection of his eyes under the tiny deck light i read fear in his facea real fearalmost a terror then i give it to him straight out with what you want i says maybe i can help you but let me tell you first that there are plenty of rooms aboard the boat now you dont look like a crookyou dont look sharp enough whats the big idea of wanting to bunk with me he thought a moment and then leaned far over the rail and started to talk keeping his eyes on the water im in some kind of trouble i dont know if i have been followed aboard this boat or not i dont think so but i cant chance it i havent had any sleep in two nights and while i dont expect to sleep tonight im afraid i may drop off i dont want to be alone andand you struck me as an easygoing fellow who mightmight like to take a chance on getting bumped off i cut in he kind of drew away when i said this but i let him see right away that perhaps he didnt have me wrong and you would like me to sit up and protect you eh i didnt exactly mean that but ii dont want to be alone now if you were a man i could offer money to he paused and waited i give him credit for putting the thing delicately and leaving the next move to me i didnt want to scare him off by putting him wise that he had come within my line of business it might look suspicious to him and i didnt want him to get the impression that i was a novice there might be some future money in a job like this and it wouldnt do to be underrated ill tell you what ill do i says ive been all over the world and done some odd jobs for different south american governmentsthat always has its appealand ill sit up and keep an eye on you for a hundred bucks crudemaybebut then i know my game and you dont and i can sleep he chirps and his eyes sort of brighten up like a baby i tells him good he says and come to my cabin so i take the number of his cabin and tell him that ill meet him there as soon as i get my bag then i leave him and fetch my bag and put what money i have in the pursers office for although i can size up a game right away a fellow cant afford to take chances i have run across queerer ducks than this in my time twenty minutes later hes in bed and weve turned the sign about smoking to the wall and are puffing away on a couple of good cigars all contenthes paid me the hundred like a man two nice new fifties he just lay there and smoked and didnt talk much and didnt seem as sleepy as i had thought he was but i guess he was too tired to sleep which is a queer thing but ive had it lots of times myself he seemed to be thinking too like he was planning something and i was concerned in it but i didnt bother him none i saw what was on his chest and he didnt seem in a condition to keep things to himself i thought hed out with some proposition for me but i didnt know i wasnt anxious to travel about and be a nurse to him thats more of a job for a private detective but they aint used over much because they want to know all about your business and then youre worse off than you were before at last he opens up whats your business he says and seeing i got his hundred there aint no reason to dodge the question i up and tells him im a soldier of fortune he kind of blinks at this and then asks that means a chap who takes chances forfor a consideration certain kind of chances i qualify his statement like this for instance sometimes but i dont reckon to travel around as a body guard if thats what youre thinking he laughs like he was more at ease but i often see them laugh when they are getting ready to send me into the danger that they fear its not downright meanness like i used to think when i was younger its relief i guess i think i can use you he said slowly and pay you well and you wont need to see me again oh i aint got any particular dislike to you i tell him its only that i like to work alone let me hear what you have to offer and thenwell you can get some sleep tonight anyways he thought a moment how much do i have to tell you he asked as much or as little as you like the less the betterbut all i ought to know to make things go right for you well then there isnt much to tell in the first place i want you to impersonate me for the summer or a greater part of it thats not so easy i shook my head its easy enough he went on eagerly i am supposed to go to my fathers hotel on nantucket island then he leaned out of the bed and talked quickly he spoke very low and was very much in earnest they could not possibly know me there his father was abroad and he had not been to nantucket since he was ten how old are you he asked me suddenly thirty i told him you dont look more than i do we are much alikeabout the same sizethe same features and you wont meet anyone i know if things should go wrong ill be in touch with you and your trouble i questioned what should i know about that that my life is threatened i have been mixed up with some people whom i am not proud of and they threaten to kill you i stroked my chin not that i minded taking the chances but somewheres i had learned that a labourer is worthy of his hire it looked like he was hiring me to get bumped off in his place which was all right if i was paid enough i had taken such chances before and nothing had come of it that is nothing to me yes they threaten my lifebut i think its all bluff i nodded i could plainly see it was that so i handed out a little talk and thats why you paid me a hundred to sit up with you all night mind you i dont mind the risk but i must be paid accordingly when he saw that it was only a question of money he opens up considerable he didnt exactly give me the facts in the case but he tells me enough and i learned that he had never seen the parties the end of it was that he draws up a paper which asks me to impersonate him and lets me out of all trouble of course the paper wouldnt be much good in a bad jam but it would help if his old man should return suddenly from europe but i dont aim to produce that paper i play the game fair and the figure he names was a good onenot what i would have liked perhaps but all he could afford to pay without bringing his old man into the case which could not be done somehow when we finished talking i got the idea that he had been mixed up in a shady dealbootlegging or somethingand a couple of friends had gone to jail on his evidence there were three others from canada who were coming on to get himthe three he had never seen but it didnt matter much to me i was just to show them that he wasnt afraid and then when they called things off or got me all was over personally i did think that there was a lot of bluff in the whole business but he didnt and it wasnt my game to wise him up it was a big hotel i was going to for the summer and if things got melodramatic why i guess i could shoot as good as any bootlegger that ever robbed a church theyre hard guys yes but then i aint exactly a cakeeater myself an hour or more talk in which i learn all about his family and the hotel and burton combs drops off for his first real sleep in months the next morning we part company in his stateroom and i taxied over to new bedford he thinks thats better than taking the train because there is a change of cars in the open country and he dont want me to drop too soon there are only about ten staterooms on the little tub that makes the trip from new bedford to nantucket and i have one of them which is already reserved in burton combss name after taking a walk about the ship i figure that there aint no desperate desmonds aboard and having earned my hundred the night before i just curl up in that little cabin and hit the hay five hours and not a dream disturbed me and when i come on deck theres nantucket right under our nose and we are rounding the little lighthouse that stands on the point leading into the bay theres a pile of people on the dock and they sure did look innocent enough and i take a stretch and feel mighty good from some of the outfits i see i know that im going to travel in class and i hope that burton combss clothes fit me for i didnt come away prepared for any social gayety but its early in the season yet and ill get a chance to look around before the big rush begins there is a bus at the dock which is labelled sea breeze inn and thats my meat i climb in with about five others and we are off up one shady street and down another up a bit of a hill and a short straightaway and we are at the hotel its a peach too with a view of the ocean that would knock your eye out the manager spots me at once and says that hed know me among a thousand as a combs which was real sweet of him seeing that he was expecting me and the others in the bus were an old man three old women and a young girl about nineteen but it wasnt my part to enlighten him and tell him that i was on to his flattery besides he was an old bird and probably believed what he said he was right glad to see me and tried to look like he meant it and wondered why i hadnt come up there again in all these years but guessed it was because it was kind of slow with my father having a hotel at atlantic city and at ostend and he wanted to know if i was going to study the business said my father wrote him that he would like to see me interested in the hotel line i didnt say much there wasnt no need mr rowlands the manager was one of those fussy old parties and he talked all the way up in the elevator and right into the room there were about fifty people there all told on the first of july but they kept coming in all the time and after i was there about two weeks the place was fairly well crowded but i didnt make any effort to learn the business thinking it might hurt young combs who didnt strike me as a chap who would like any kind of work there was one young girl therethe one that came up in the bus with memarion st james and we had quite some times together she was young and full of life and wanted to be up and doing all the time and we did a great deal of golf together then there was another who took an interest in me she was a widow and a fine looker and it was her first season there i thought that she was more used to playing atlantic city for she didnt look like the usual run of staunch new england dames sort of out of place and she looked to me to trot her around but i didnt have the time there was marion to be taken about she was what youd call a flapper and talked of the moonlight and such rot but she was real and had a big heart and after all a sensible little head on her shoulders and she couldnt see the widow a mile and looked upon me as her own special property and blew the widow up every chance she got but the widow i guess was bent on making a match and she was finding the island pretty dead though the son of john b combs the hotel magnate looked like a big catch so you see my time was fairly well taken up and i grabbed many a good laugh i never took women seriously my game and women dont go well together yet that widow was persistent and curious and wanted to know every place marion and me went and used to keep asking me where we drove to nights for the kid and me did a pile of motoring yes i had a car a nice little touring car came with the burton combs moniker marion was different she was just a slip of a kid stuck up in a place like that and it was up to me to show her a good time i kind of felt sorry for her and then she was pretty and a fellow felt proud to be seen with her all the time i kept an eye peeled for the bad men i wondered if theyd come at all and if they did i thought that they would come in the busy season when they wouldnt be noticed much but that theyd come at all i very much doubted and then they camethe three of them i knew them the very second they entered the door they were dolled right up to the height of fashionjust what the others were wearing but i knew them they just didnt belong maybe the others didnt spot them as outsiders but i did they were no bluff either i have met all kinds of men in my day bad and worse and these three were the real thing it came to me that if these gents were bent on murder i had better be up and doing and that island boasted that it had never had a real murder yes it sure did look like all records were going to be broken one of them was a tall skinny fellow and he looked more like a real summer visitor than the others but his mouth gave him away when he thought he was alone with the others hed talk through the side of it a trick which is only found in the underworld or on the track one of the others was fat and looked like an exbartender and the third i should say was just a common jailbird that could cut a mans throat with a smile the tall skinny one was the leader and he was booked as mr james farrow he made friends with me right off the bat didnt overdo it you know just gave me the usual amount of attention that most of the guests showed toward the owners son he musta read a book about the island for he tried to tell me things about the different points of interest like hed been there before but he had a bad memory like on dates and things marion gave me the dope on that she knew that island like a book i didnt have much doubt as to who they were but i checked them up liking to make sure i didnt know just what their game was and i didnt see the big idea of wanting to bump me off if they wanted money i could catch their point but they seemed well supplied with the ready yes sir i looked this farrow over and hes a tough bird and no mistake but then ive seen them just as tough before and pulled through it besides i hold a few tricks myself they dont know im on and they dont know that im mighty quick with the artillery myself and that gun is always with me it aint like i only carry it when i think theres trouble coming i always have it you see a chap in my line of work makes a lot of bad friends and he cant tell when one of them is going to bob up and demand an explanation but they all find out that i aint a bird to fool with and am just as likely to start the fireworks as they are nearly every night after dinner id take the car and marion and me would go for a little spin about the island i dont know when i ever enjoyed anything so much and sometimes id forget the game i was playing and think that things were different ive met a pile of women in my time but none like marion nor near like her not since the days when i went to schooland thats a memory only well wed just drive about and talk and shed ask me about the different places i had been to and i could hold my own there for ive been all over the world then one nightabout ten days after the troupe arrivedi get a real scare weve been over scònset way and are driving home along about ninethirty whenziptheres a whiz in the air and a hole in the windshield then theres another zip and i see marion jump its nothing new to me i knew that sound right away its a noiseless gun and someone has taken a couple of plugs at us from the distance well it aint my cue to stop so i speed up and its pretty near town before i slow down beneath a lamp and turn to marion there is a little trickle of blood running down her cheek and shes pretty white but she aint hurt any its just a scratch and i stop in the drug store and get some stuff and bathe it off she is a mighty game little kid and dont shake a bit and act nervous but im unsteady for the first time in my life and my hand shook i wouldnt of been much good on a quick draw then but later i would for i was madbad madif you know what that is i see that all the danger aint mine not that i think they meant to get marion but i had brought that kid into something and all because she kind of liked me a bit and i took her around on the way back to the hotel i buck up and tell her that it must have been some of the natives hunting the hares and not to say anything about it but that i would speak to the authorities in the morning she just looked at me funny and i knew that she did not believe me but she let it go at that if thats all you want to tell me burtwhyall righti shant say a word to anyone you can trust me that was all neither of us spoke again until we reached the hotel and i had parked the car under the shed at the side and we were standing at the bottom of the steps by the little side entrance then she turned and put her two tiny hands up on my shoulders and the paleness had gone from her face but just across her cheek where the bullet had passed was the smallest streak of vivid red you can trust me burt she said again and there seemed to be a question in her voice of course i trust you marion i answered and my voice was husky and seemed to come from a distance it all happened very suddenly after that her head was very close i know for her soft hair brushed my cheek i think that she leaned forward but i know that she looked up into my eyes and that the next moment i had leaned down and kissed and held her so a moment so we stood and she did not draw away and i made no movement to release her we were alone there very much alone then there was the sudden chug of a motor a seconds flash of light and i had opened my arms and marion was gone and i stood alone in the blackness so the spell of marions presence was broken and i stood silently in the shadow as farrow and his two companions passed and entered the hotel lobby had they seen us yesi knew that they had for they smiled as they passed smiled and never knew that they had passed close to death for at that moment it was only the press of a trigger that lay between them and eternity the curtain had been rung up on the first act and the show was on before i could sleep easy at night for the danger was mine and i had thought little of it but now i felt that it was anothersandwell i resolved to bring things to a head that night ten minutes later i went to my room but not to bed i put my light out and sat in the room until about twelve oclock at that time the hotel was as quiet as death then i stepped out of my window and climbed down the fire escape which led to the little terrace which overlooked the ocean i knew just where farrows room was and i walked along the terrace until i was under it and then swung myself up the fire escape and climbed to the third story his window was open and thirty seconds later i had dropped into the room and was seated on the end of farrows bed then i switched on the light and waited till he woke up guess he didnt have much fear of me for he slept right on for another five minutes and then he kind of turned over and blinked andopened his eyes he was awake fast enough then for he was looking in the mean end of my automatic he was quick witted too for he rubbed his eyes with one hand while he let the other slip under his pillow then i laughed and he drew it out empty and sat bolt upright in bed and faced the gun farrow i says you were mighty near to going out tonight and if i hadnt already lifted that gun of yours id a popped you then and i half wished that i had let his gun stay there for then there would have been an excuse to let him have it a poor excuse but still an excuse its hard to shoot a man when he aint armed and prepared but its another thing to shoot when hes reaching for a gun and its your life or his then you can let him have it with your mind easy he was a game bird was farrow for he must have had plenty to think about at that moment you see he couldnt tell just what was coming to him and from his point of view it must have looked mighty bad but he started right in to talk told me the chances i was taking and that i couldnt possibly get away with it he didnt waste any time in bluffing and pretending surprise at seeing me sitting there with the gun i give him creditnowfor understanding the situation but i stopped his wind shut up i says and he caught the anger in my eyes and in my voice and he shutwhich was good for him for a chap cant tell for sure what hes going to do when hes seeing red and has the drop on a lad that he figures needs killing then i did a bit of talking i told him what had taken place that night and i knew it was his doing and he nodded and never tried to deny it you killed my brother he says for he died in trying to break jail a few months agothe jail where you sent him soi killed your brother eh well every man is entitled to his own opinion now i dont know about the killing of your brother but ill tell you this my friend i come mighty near to killing you and i dont miss either and i dont crack windshields and i dont go for to hit innocent parties i could see that he was kind of surprised at the way i talked for i wasnt specially careful about my language like i had been about the hotel and like what he would expect from the real burton combs but i could see that he kind of smacked his lips at the mention of the girl and he knew that he had a hold on me there but i didnt care what was on his chest i knew that the morning would see the end of the thing one way or the other i am going to give you until the sixthirty boat tomorrow morning to leave the island i told him and i was not bluffing either after a man has had his warning its good ethics to shoot him downat least i see it that way that is if he needs it bad and you happen to have my code of morals also if you want to live to a ripe old age what then he sort of sneers seeing as how he wasnt going over the hurdles right away he thinks im a bit soft in the same position his own doubt about shooting me would be the chances of a getaway and the chances were not good on that island unless you had made plans in advance perhaps he hadi didnt know then for i hadnt seen any boat hanging about the harbour what then he sneers again then i says very slowly and thinking of marion then ill cop you off at breakfast tomorrow morning yesas soon as that boat leaves the dock ill be gunning for you mr james farrow and as sure as youre not a better shot than you were tonight out on the moors youll go join your brother with that i turned from the bed and unlocking his door walked out of his room the temptation to shoot was too great but i didnt go to bed that night i just put out my light and sat smoking in my roomsmoking and thinking so i spent the second night that summer awake i knew that the three would meet and talk it over and no doubtget but i just sat there half facing the door and half facing the window with my gun on my knees waiting how nice would it be if they would only come by the window it would be sweet thenand what a lot of credit id get as burton combs protecting his fathers property they meant real business all right for i see now that there was sentiment behind the whole thingsentiment and honour that peculiar honour of the underworld which goes and gets a squealer combs had evidently squealed and farrows brother had paid the price and combs went free position and evidence and politics had done the trick i guess i heard the clock strike two and then twothirty and then there was a footstep in the hall and i turned and faced the door and then there come a light tap on the door this sure was a surprise i didnt turn on the electric light but just went to the door and swung it open suddenly and stepped back but no one came in then i heard a kind of a gaspa womans voice the first thing i thought of was marion and then i see the widow in the dim hall light her hair was all down and she had thrown a light robe about her and she was excited and her eyes were wide open and she looked frightened its marionlittle miss st james she sobbed and shes in my room nowand it was terrible and i thinki think she fainted then she stopped and kind of choked a bit right away it came to me that this gang had done something to her and i wished that i had settled the whole thing earlier in the evening when i had the chance but come i said to the widow and took her by the arm and led her down the hall to her room the door was open and gun in hand i rushed into the room ahead of her there on the bed she gasped behind me i turned to the bedand it was empty and then i knew but it was too late for i was trapped there was a muzzle of a gun shoved into the middle of my back and a hard laugh then farrow spoke throw that gun on the bed and throw it quick andand i threw it and threw it quick i was done i should have suspected the widow from the first day i laid eyes on her for she didnt belong yes she was this gangs come on and me who had never fallen for women was now caught by women a good one and a bad one one whom i wanted to protect and one who knew it now you see how the game is played neither a good nor a bad woman can help you in my sort of life and yet i would take any chance for that little marion who used to stand out on the moor at thebut farrow was talking and now mr combs we meet againand youre the one to do the listening we are going to take you for a little motor ridethat is you are going out with me to meet my friends we dont intend to kill you that is if you have proved yourself a man and come along quietly there is some information i want from you and thanks for the return of my gun he finished as he picked the gun off the bed yes it was his gun and mine was still in my pocket and ida shot him then only i saw that the widow was covering me come farrow turned and poking the gun close to my ribs he induced me to leave the room with him if you make a noise you go he told me as we walked down the long narrow hall to the servants stairs but i didnt intend to cry out if he would just move that gun of his the least little bit i could draw and shoot i almost laughed the thing was so easy the elsie is lying right off the point he went on as we approached the little shed where my car was kept you remember the elsieit used to be your boat the government remembers it too but they dont know it now nor would you but enough of that climb into your carwell use that for our little jaunt we had reached the little shed now and i climbed into the car always waiting for a chance to use my gun but he watched me like a hawk then he laugheda queer weird laugh which had the ring of death in it i drove as he said and we turned from the hotel and out onto the moorsthat long stretch of desolate road that leads across the island and then he made me stop the car and stand up ill take your gun he said and he lifted it from my hip we wont need more than one gun between us tonight for if it comes to shooting ill take care of that end of it he threw the gun into the back of the car where i heard it strike the cushion of the rear seat and bounce to the floor we drove on in silence he never said a word but i felt as clearly as if he had told me so that he was driving me to my death the gun he had let me carry until we were safe away perhaps he had thought that without it i might have cried out in the hotel but this i shall never know that he knew all along i had it i have no doubt more than once i was on the edge of telling him that i was not the man he thought i was for it looked as though the game was up but he would not have believed me and besides my little agreement with combs was back in my hotel room not a soul did we pass as we sped over the deserted road no light but the dulled rays of the moon broke the darkness all around us half hour or more and then suddenly i see a car in the road as the moon pops out from behind the clouds then farrow spoke and there was the snarl of an animal in his voice heres where you stop he growled and heres where you get yours theyll find you out here in the morning and they can think what they want well be gone and the killing of a rat like you is the only business ive got on the moors this night i had pulled up short in the centre of the road now for a big touring car which i recognised as farrows was stretched across our path blocking the passage in it i clearly saw his two friends it was death now sure but i made up my mind to go out as gracefully as possible and when he ordered me to open the door i leaned over and placed my hand upon the seat and it fell on the cool muzzle of a revolver yes my fingers closed over a gun and i knew that that gun was mine thrills in lifeyesthere are many but i guess that that moment was my biggest i didnt stop to think how that gun got there i didnt care i just tightened on it and felt the blood of life pass quickly through my bodyif you know what i mean i couldnt turn and shoot him for he had his pistol pressed close against my side what he feared i dont know but i guess he was just one of these overcareful fellows who didnt take any chances open that door and get out he ordered again as he gave me a dig in the ribs i leaned over again and placed my hand upon the handle of the door and then i got a happy thought i cant open it i said and i let my voice tremble and my hand shake but in my left hand i now held my gun and thanked my lucky stars that i was lefthanded for i knew if i got the one chance that i hoped for it would have to be a perfect shot white livered after all he muttered and he stooped over and placed his left hand upon the handle of the door his right hand still held the gun close to my side and his eyes were watching my every movement i never seen a man so careful before i couldnt pull the gun up and shoot for he would get me at the very first movementand although i was tempted i waited the other two sat in the car ahead and were smoking and laughing of course i knew that if i once stepped out in the moonlight with the gun in my hand that it was all up but i waited and then the door really stuck a bit for the nights are mighty damp on that island and it was that dampness which saved my life for just the fraction of a second he took his eyes off mejust a glance down at the door with a curse on his lips and with that curse on his lips he died for as he turned the handle i give it to him right through the heart i dont miss at that rangenonot me the door flew open and he tumbled out on the roaddead i dont offer no apologies for it was his life or mine andas i saidhe tumbled out on the roaddead another fellow writing might say that things werent clear after that but they were clear enough to me because i never lose my head thats why i have lived to be thirty and expect to die in bed yes things are always clear when clearness means a little matter of life or death those other chaps were so surprised at the turn things had taken that i had jumped to the road and winged one of them before they knew what had happened but the other fellow was quick and had started shooting and i felt a sharp pain in my right shoulder but one shot was all that he fired and then i had himone good shot was all i needed andhe went out i dont go for to miss i didnt take the time to examine them to see if they were dead im not an undertaker and it wasnt my business i guessed they were but if they wasnt i didnt intend to finish the job im not a murderer either then there were a couple of houses not so far off and i could see lightslights that werent there beforein both of them even on a quiet island like that you cant start a gun party without disturbing some of the people i just turned my car around and started back to the hotel twenty minutes later i had parked it in the shed and gone to my room as far as i knew no one could know what had taken place on the lonely moor that night i played doctor to my shoulder it wasnt so very bad either though it pained a lot but the bullet had gone through the flesh and passed out i guess a little home treatment was as good as any doctor could do then the morning came and my arm was not so good but i dressed and went down to breakfast and saw the manager and he told me that the widow had gone on the early boat i dont think that she was a real widow but that she was the wife of one of those chaps farrow i guess but that didnt bother me none she was a widow now all right and then about nine oclock news of the three dead men being found away off on the road came in and i know i got all three of them there was a lot of talk and newspaper men from the city came over and detectives and one thing and another the morning papers of the following day had it all in and wild guesses as to how it happened the three were recognised by the police as notorious characters and then it got about that a rumrunner had been seen off the east shore that very morning the general opinion seemed to be that there had been a fight among the pirates and that these three men got theirswhich suited me to a t i woulda beat it only that would have looked mighty queer and honestly i didnt see where they had a thing on me i thought the best thing to do was to sit tight and for nearly a week i sat and then the unexpectedunexpected by me at leasthappened the widow sent a telegram to the boston police and they came down and nailed me you see the writing on the wall keep clear of the women a dick from boston dropped in one morning and i knew him the minute he stepped foot in the hotel and i also knew that he was after me though at the time i didnt wise up as to how he was on but he wasnt sure of himself and he had the manager introduce him to me then he talked about everything but the killing and of course he was the only one at the hotel that left that topic out of his conversation and that was his idea of hiding his identity but he was sharp enough at that and hadnt gone about the island more than a couple of days before he stuck this and that together and had enough on me to make the charge but he was a decent sort of chap and came up to my room late at night with the manager and put the whole thing straight up to me and told me about the widows telegram and that i was under arrest and that i had better get a hold of the best lawyer that money could buy for i was in for a tough time he was right and i knew that i was in a mighty bad hole but i also knew that there would be plenty of money behind me when the whole thing came out and money is a mighty good thing to get out of a hole with so i played the game and never let on that i wasnt the real burton combs they locked me up and notified my adopted father and the next morning the news was shouted all over the world for john b combs cut a big figure and his sons arrest made some music and then the combs lawyer harvey benton came up to see me and the minute he set eyes on me the cat was out of the bag and i up and tells him the whole story though i didnt give him the reason for combs being frightened but just said that he was threatened by these three rumrunners i felt that my playing the game fair would give me a better standing with the combses and help loosen up the old purse strings young combs wasnt such a bad fellow either for the next day he was down to see me and ready to tell the whole story and stand up for me the we moved over to the mainland and i couldnt get out on bail and the prosecuting attorney started to have my record looked up and i can tell you that after that things didnt look so rosy it all goes to prove that a clean sheet helps a man though mine wasnt nothing to be ashamed of but i will admit that it looked pretty sick on the front pages of the newspapers then john b combs himself arrives and comes up to see me he listens to my story at first with a hard cold face but when i come to the part where i have to shoot quick or die his eyes kind of fill and i see hes thinking of his son and the chances he would of had in the same placeand how if i hadnt got them they woulda got burton then he stretches forth his hand and grasps mine and i see it would have been better if burton had taken his father into his confidence in the first place yes the old boy was a good scout and he told me that he loved his son and that i had saved his sons life and he didnt care what my past had been and he would see me through this thing that his son had gotten me into if it cost a fortune it was a funny thing all around here was me the sufferer comforting the old boy and telling him that it was nothing just like the chair looking me in the face was an everyday affair but i didnt much like the idea of his being so sad for it gives me the impression that my chances are not so good and that i am going to pay the price for his son which aint nothing to sing about but it was my word against the word of the gang and they being dead wouldnt have much to say yes i was indicted all right and held for the grand juryfirst degree murder was the charge then come a wait with my lawyers trying to get a hold of some farmer who might of seen something of the shooting and would corroborate my story then comes the trial and you woulda thought that the district attorney had a personal grudge against me all his life and that all the politicians and onehorse newspapers were after his job he paints up those three crooks like they were innocent young country girls that had been trapped by a couple of designing men and he tells how burton combs done them in a shady deal and when he feared they was going to tell the authorities he up and hires a professional murderer to kill them i tell you it made a mighty good story and he told it well one could almost see those three cherubs going forth in childlike innocence to be slaughtered by the butcherwhich is me and he punched holes in my story especially that part about how i put down my hand and found the gun on the seat and he said that i took them out on some pretence and shot them down in cold bloodquick shooting being my business and shady deals my living when he got through with my story it was as full of holes as a sieve and i had a funny feeling around the chest because i thought anyone could see what a rotten gang this was and what a cleanliving young fellow i was for my lawyer painted me up as a young gentleman what went around the world trying to help others just when i think that things are all up and the jury are eyeing me with hard stern faces comes the surprise you see i had never told a soul about marion being in the car with me when that gang first started the gun play out on the scònset road you see i didnt see the need of it andandwell somehow i just couldnt drag her into it weakness ill admit for a fellow facing death should fight with every weapon he can grab and theres that thing about women cropping up again but somehow there in that stuffy courtroom her innocent face and those soft childlike eyes come up before me and i see she might of helped me a lot with the simple truth about the bullet that crossed her cheek and while i was thinking about marion and telling myself that my goose was cooked comes that big surprise my lawyer calls a witness and its marion st james gad my heart just stops beating for the moment she was very quiet and very calm but her voice was low and the jury had to lean forward to catch what she said she told about the ride that night and how the bullet broke the windshield and scratched her cheek and then came the shock i was just dreaming there and thinking of the trouble i had caused her when i heard what she was saying and i woke upquick after i left mr combsi called him burton and she pointed down at me i went upstairs but i couldnt sleep i was thinking about what had happened out on the moor that night of course i didnt believe what burton had told meabout the hares and then i remembered the look on his face as he bathed off my cheekand it was terrible to see and then she paused a moment and wiped her eyes and went on after a bit i looked out the window and i could see the little shed where burt kept his car and i just caught the glimpse of a man going into it i thought it was burt and that he was going to drive out on the moor andoh i dont know what i thought but i was frightened and didnt want him to go and i just rushed out of my room and down the back stairs and out toward the shed i was just in time to see a big touring car pull out and two men were in it and then i waited a minute and went and looked into the shed and burts car was still there i dont know why but i was frightened and i climbed into the little touring car and sat down in the back and kind of rested then i heard someone coming and i hid down in the back of the car and pulled some rugs up over me and waited and why did you wait my lawyer asked her kindly i just thought that i would be able to help mrburtand i wanted to help him was there any other reason yesi thought that he was going into trouble for me andand she paused a moment yes the lawyer encouraged and i wanted to help him she said the words so low that you could hardly catch them but the lawyer didnt ask her to repeat them i guess he thought it went over better that way and it sure didat least with me for i knew what she meant then she went on pretty soon mr combs came along for she kept calling me burton combs and that big man was with him the one they called mr farrow i looked carefully up over the door for it was very dark where i was and i saw that mr farrow had a gun in his hand and that he held it close up against mr combss back and he talked rough but too low to understand and then they both climbed into the front of the machine i did not know just what i could do but i thoughtohi dont know what i thought but i did so want to help him and i was just too scared to cry out and then they started off and after they were a little way out in the country mr farrow made burton stop the car and stand up while he searched him and he found his revolver and took it from him and threw it into the back of the car it landed on the seat and bounced off and i stretched out my hand and took hold of it and held it there under the rugs i didnt know what to do with it at first for i had never fired a gun then i heard mr farrow say that he was going to kill mr combs and i was terribly frightened but i leaned up and stretched my hand over the seat and tried to give the pistol to mr combs but mr farrow turned suddenly and i became frightened and dropped the pistol then i dropped back in the car again but i was half out of the covers and afraid to pull them over me for the car had stopped again and i had a feeling that someone was looking down at me then i heard them moving in front of the car and i looked up and i saw that mr farrow had his gun pressed close against mr combss side and that mr combs was trying to open the door then came the sudden report and i think that i cried out for i thought that burt was shot then came several more shots one right after another and i looked out and saw mr combs standing in the moonlight and a man beside another big car firing at himand then the man fell and she broke off suddenly and started to cry and after that my lawyer smiled at her i climbed back under the robes andmr combs drove me back to the hotelbut he never knew i was there well that just about settled it i guess the room was in more or less of an uproar and you ought to have heard my lawyer now i know why good lawyers get so much money he started in and he sure did paint that gang up mighty black and now i was the innocent boy led into danger by these hardened criminals and he showed how the gun was held close to my side when i fired and if that isnt selfdefence and good american pluck id like to ask you what in heavens name is and thats the whole show one hour later i was a free man everybody was shaking hands with me and from a desperate criminal i had suddenly become a hero and i guess that marion had done it then old combs came up to me and shook me by the hand and told me how glad he was that i was free and what a plucky little thing marion was and how i owed my life twice over to her then he offered me a job imagine another job for the combs family but this was different there is too much good in you to lead the life you have been leading you may think that it is all right but there will be others that wont i can offer you something that will be mighty good but i shook my head i guess ill stick to my trade i said ive had good offers before and in my linethis little notoriety wont hurt none its a good position he says not paying much attention to what i was getting off the right people will be glad to know youand there will be enough money in it to get married i started to shake my head again when he handed me a note read this note and then let me know not another word until you have read it he smiles i took the little blue envelope and tore it open and it was from marion i would like to see you again when you take that position of mr combs i guess i read that simple sentence over a couple of dozen times before i again turned to mr combs i guess ill take that jobif it pays enough to get married on was all that i said there aint no explanation unlessunless i wanted to see marion again myself thats all unless to warn you that it would be kind of foolish to take too seriously anything i said about keeping clear of the women clinton h stagg little is known about the shortlived clinton h stagg creator of thornley colton blind detective readers must turn to the fiction itself for clues about the character of its author in inventing an early example of a sleuth who uses a physical handicap to advantage stagg repeatedly proved that apparent limitations can be overcome with intelligence at a time when people with disabilities were commonly viewed as figures of pity stagg made his blind sleuth a figure of admiration stagg worked in the sherlock holmes tradition endowing his sleuth with superb mental powers enhanced by extraordinary abilities in interpreting clues whereas holmes may have known how to identify numerous varieties of cigar ash colton uses supersensitive powers of hearing and touch to provide a unique outlook on clues that the sighted police cannot see like holmes colton is teamed with a watson figure sydney thames whom colton picked up on the banks of that london river he accompanies colton and receives his explanations with awe when for instance in a crowded new york hotel dining room the blind sleuth remarks that a woman is too heavily rouged thames is predictably amazed good heavens thorn he exclaims in watsonesque wonder sometimes i wonder if you are blind his mentor explains that his fingers tell him much in the lights of a broadway restaurant the keyboard of silence gives me the secrets of living hearts colton intones such heightened sensitivity as compensation for blindness was used earlier by the british author ernest bramah who created the blind detective max carrados and later by the american writer baynard kendrick whose sightless sleuth was captain duncan maclain colton s leg man shrimp is another sad case whom the hero has rescued this frecklefaced lad with a penchant for imitating his dimenovel hero nick carter is also known as the fee because he was the only payment colton received for a case in which the murder of shrimps mother by his father left him orphaned the keyboard of silence is collected in a volume of eight problems solved by the supersensitive sleuth it demonstrates staggs extraordinary eye for detail and shows the charactershero and criminal alikeas spokesmen for their creator who has eluded literary historians like the major players in his story stagg was a detailist who plotted his mysteries and planned their solutions with consummate care along the way a profound insight into character guides the blind detective toward the truth readers may agree that they cannot see the solution to this problem until a blind man has shown them the keyboard of silence i not often did mere man attract attention in the famous diningroom of the regal but men and women alike who were seated near the east archway raised their eyes to stare at the man who stood in the doorway calmly surveying them the smokeglass tortoiseshell library spectacles which made of his eyes two great circles of dull brown brought out the whiteness of the face strikingly the nose with its delicately sensitive nostrils was thin and straight the lips now curved in a smile somehow gave one the impression that released by the mind they would suddenly spring back to their accustomed thin straight line for a smile seemed out of place on that pale masterful face with its lean cleft chin the snowwhite hair of silky fineness that curled away from the part to show the pink scalp underneath contrasted sharply with the sober black of the faultless dinnercoat that fell in just the proper folds from the broad shoulders and deep chest the eyes of the girl at the sixth table seemed to be held fascinated the elder woman who was with her toyed with her salad and conformed to convention by stealing covert glances at the man in the archway and the squarechinned cleanlooking young man who made the third of the party stared openly unashamed but his eyes held not the other diners rude questioning nor yet the girls frank fascination you are staring rhoda rebuked the elder woman mildly the girl turned her eyes with a little sigh what wonderful character there is in his face she murmured he is a wonderful character asserted the man his face lighting up boyishly his tone one of admiration you know him both asked it in a breath eyes eager yes he is thornley colton man about town club member musician whose recreation is the solving of problems that baffle other men it was he who found the murderer of president parkins of the uptown national and when the crash came secured me my position in the berkley trust a detective the elder woman asked it the girls eyes were again on colton no the man shook his head he jokingly calls himself a problemist and accepts only those cases that he thinks will prove interesting for the solving of them is merely his recreation he takes no fees the man with him is his secretary sydney thames whose name is pronounced like that of the river he too is a remarkably handsome man but he is never noticed when with thornley colton except as his coalblack hair and eyes and red cheeks form a striking contrast to colton i had not even noticed him confessed the elder woman as she glanced for the first time at the slim young man of twentyfive or six who stood at colton s side eyes apparently taking in every detail of the big diningroom then she remembered her duty as mentor you must not stare so rudely rhoda she chided i dont think mr colton minds the stare the man said quietly he has been totally blind since birth though many people refuse to believe it blind they both breathed it in their voices the tender sympathy all women feel for the misfortunes of others he is coming warned the elder woman unnecessarily they had seen the headwaiter apparently apologise to colton and step aside the secretary had whispered a few words and thornley colton his slim stick held lightly and idly in his fingers started down the aisle between the rows of tables shoulders swung back chin up followed by sydney thames the woman and the girl watched his approach with parted lips in their eyes mother fear for his safety as he hurried toward them stepping aside at exactly the proper moment to avoid a hurrying waiter walking around the very much overdressed stout woman whose chair projected a foot over the unmarked aisle line as he neared their table they saw the thin lips frame a smile of friendly greeting how do you do mr morris his voice rich of wonderful musical timbre seemed to thrill the girl with its kindliness and strength as he stepped around her chair to shake hands with her escort sydney saw you while we were waiting for our table will you meet miss richmond asked norris when he had answered the greeting in kind colton turned instantly to face the girl his slim white hand with its long tapering fingers outstretched it is a concession we of the darkness ask of every one he apologized their hands met the girl felt the warm grip and her sensitive wrist seemed to feel a touch light as the touch of windblown thistledown but it was gone instantly and she knew it was but the telepathic thrill of the meeting palms she murmured a commonplace and bit her lips in vexation because it was a commonplace the man before her seemed to call for more your singing is wonderful miss richmond he declared enthusiastically sydney and i have had orchestra seats three nights this week you know to me music must give the combined pleasures of painting sculpture architecture and other beautiful things the average person doesnt even appreciate her eyes expressed their pity but her lips said only my mother mr colton they shook hands across the table mrs richmond with a heartiness that was not part of the artificial code new york has fixed he with a few words that brought a flush of pleasure to her faded cheeks why didnt mr thames stay asked norris curiously he hurried on as though he thought we were plague victims he usually does smiled colton he has a very curious fear ill tell you about it some time why dont you drop into the bank and see me some day you havent been in my tomblike office for months miss richmond and her mother saw me at work for a few minutes this afternoon it compares very favourably with the dressingrooms given to operasingers they say i should say so laughed the girl if you can compare persian rugs and mahogany with our cracked walls and boxpropped dressingtables and plugged gasjets men always do take the best conceded colton smilingly then he addressed norris directly how is simpson attending to business nowadays he has been away for a week he came in this afternoon to amaze us with the news that he had just been married he didnt have much to say about his wife however except that he was going to turn over a new leaf thats news whistled colton he never struck me as the marrying kind nor any one else laughed norris with a tender significant glance at the girl across the table ill have to look him up and congratulate him till we meet again then and with a pleasant nod of parting to each of them a touch of a chair leg with his slim stick colton hurried down the aisle to the small table in the far corner where sydney thames was giving his order to the waiter the servingman responded to a friendly nod from colton closed his order tablet and hurried away thornley took a cigarette from his case scratched a match on the bronze box and learned comfortably back in his chair some time sydney your terrible fear of beautiful women is going to get me into a very embarrassing position he said it half seriously half smilingly instead of seventeen steps it was but sixteen and a short half if it hadnt been for norriss habit of nervously tapping his glass with his fingertips my outstretched hand would have gone to the back of his neck i thought i had figured it exactly there was earnest contrition in the tone the sombre black eyes showed the pain of the mistake it is forgotten dismissed colton then but you should have stopped sydney miss richmonds personality is as remarkable as her singing and her mother is so proud and happy she forgets to be embarrassed at the difference between keokuk and the regal norris is lucky for she loves him and he the smiling lips needed no finishing words but she is already commanding two hundred dollars a week at the very beginning of her career and norris cannot be earning more than five thousand a year protested thames you poor boy smiled colton youll never know women that susceptible heart of yours which drives you away like a scared sheep whenever a beautiful woman approaches will never be good for anything but pumping blood thorn dont i know my weakness the tone was indescribably bitter i must keep away though im starving for the society of good women to meet one would be to fall in love hopelessly helplessly id forget that i was a thing of shame a brat picked up on the banks of the river that gave me the only name i know colton was instantly serious starvation seems a peculiar cure for hunger he mused but we have argued that so many times again the thin expressive lips finished the sentence then came the waiter with a club sandwich for thames and coltons invariable aftertheatre supper that was always ready when he came and which he never needed to order two slices of graham bread covered with rich red beefblood gravy and a bottle of mineral water colton s slim cane hollow and light as a feather the slightest touch of which sent its warning to his supersensitive fingertips rested between his knees as he ate sydney thames nibbled his sandwich absentmindedly eyes roving around the diningroom now stopping at a gaudilydressed dowager now at an overpainted lady who smiled her fixed smile at the bullnecked man at her table now at the circleeyed girl who stabbed the cherry from her empty cocktail glass with a curved tine of her oyster fork but always coming back to the fresh wholesomely beautiful face of rhoda richmond then the sombre eyes would light up for a beautiful face to sydney thames was more intoxicating than wine and to his highly sensitive nature more dangerous colton pushed his plate aside as the others eyes once more started their round of the diningroom the gods give gaudiness in recompense for the eyesparkle they have taken and the wrinkles they have given thornley colton murmured quietly one must come to a new york restaurant to realise the true pathos of beauty colton s mood had been curiously serious since those few words at norriss table thames did not answer for no answer was needed his wandering eyes had rested on a table to the left one often wonders continued colton in that same musing lowpitched voice why a stout woman like that one two tables to our left for instance will suffer the tortures of her hereafter for the sake of drinking high balls in a tight purple gown sydney had turned his eyes to stare at colton as he always did when the man who had picked him up as a bundle of babyclothes on the banks of the thames twentyfive years before made an observation of this kind many such had he heard but never did they fail to startle him how in heavens name did you know what i was doing or that she was dressed in purple he demanded you should keep both feet flat on the floor if you want to keep your staring a secret laughed colton quietly you forget that crossed knees make your suspended foot tell my cane each time you turn your head ever so slightly see that my fingers are not on my stick when you covertly watch the women you fear to meet but the purple gown demanded sydney repressing the inclination to uncross his knees and flushing at the amused smile the involuntary first motion of the foot had brought to the lips of colton all stout women who breathe asthmatically wear purple declared colton emphatically it is the only unfailing rule of femininity and to one who has practised the locating of sounds that come to doubly sharp ears the breathing part was easy there is no one at the next table on the left youll observe now you can resume your overt watching of miss richmond seehe laid both hands on the white tablecloth before himi wont look the headwaiter stopped at the table mr simpson would like to have you come to his table mr colton he wants you to meet his wife his wife put in thames quickly she is sir it was said with a positiveness there was no gainsaying where is mr simpson asked colton we had not seen him in the east wing sir where the palms are we will go to him immediately ill tell him sir his beckoning finger brought the waiter who had served them with the check sydney thames spoke some one of his cheap actress friends has roped him at last he said scornfully hes a pretty specimen of man to be first vicepresident of the conservative berkley trust company ill wager youre wrong declared colton quietly as he handed the waiter a twodollar bill from his fold if it were one of the women for whom he has been buying wine suppers for the past two years she wouldnt be where the palms are nor would the waiter be so positive of the marriage relation im not going protested thames quickly surely sydney you are not afraid a married woman will kidnap you smiled colton as he took the stick between his fingers and prepared to rise how many sydney who had turned half around in his chair to gaze toward the entrance to the east wing faced him ill go he said shortly another hasty glance and he rose with colton thirtyseven straight eighteen left nine right we will stop at the door of the east wing i cant see it there are no pretty women to disturb the distance judgment you have been so many years acquiring queried colton mildly without answering thames turned on his heel and made his way rapidly between the tables toward the east wing colton laughed silently picked up his change and hurried after his perfectly trained brain counting the steps automatically his thoughts busy elsewhere he was thinking of simpson who had gained such an unenviable reputation as a spender along the gay white way during the past two years simpson had always interested him student of human nature that he was as the one man who had never lived up to the impression colton s unerring instinct had told him was the right one the first time they had met the problemist had expected things of simpson and simpson had done nothing but idle as much time as possible in the position as first vicepresident of one of the most conservative banks in the city and spend money on women colton stopped for an instant beside thames in the archway apparently gazing idly at the crowd of men and women at the palmshaded tables two left nineteen straight half in directed thames stepping aside to follow the heavylidded thickset man with the faint lines of blue vein traceries in his cheeks rose to meet them this is a pleasure mr colton he exclaimed in heavyvoiced heartiness you are the one man i wanted to see though i hardly believed it would be my luck to catch you this night of all nights you knew the pace i was going and i want you to meet the little girl i went back to the old town to marry weve been friends since we were tots thank god i waked up in time to know what a good woman means when next you see us it will be in our own home one moment pleasehis voice sank to an almost reverent whispermy wife is deaf and dumb mr colton thames had heard had seen with curiously mixed feelings the little woman with the small boyish face around which the tendrils of brown hair curled from under the closefitting toque and had appraised the slim quietly dressed figure the half smile as she stared inquiringly at them the girl seemed but a child but he saw that her face was heavily daubed with powder and rouge as though its application had neither been taught nor practised until those last explaining words he had stood back with a halfpitying light in his eyes for he knew simpsons reputation with women but at the quietly spoken sentence he had undergone an instant change of feeling such as only highlystrung hypersensitive men like him are capable of toward the man who had gone away from his women of wine to marry a simple country girl who could neither speak nor hear simpsons fingers had been moving rapidly he bowed toward thornley colton the girl smiled and put out her small hand the movement throwing back from her wrist the filmy lace of the long sleeve for a moment they clasped hands then the girls fingers worked again simpson laughed she does not believe you are blind mr colton she says you have eyes like every one else thornley colton smiled if you tell her that ive got to wear these largelensed smoked glasses to prevent the light giving me a headache you will probably never convince her he observed as he refused the chair the waiter had drawn up sydney thames acknowledged his introduction with a bow and the usual meaningless words but his eyes were soft and tender as a womans as they met those of the girl in the instants glance she gave him before the lashes were lowered a womans face never failed to stir him wont you sit down pleaded simpson it will probably be the last time you will ever find me in one of these glided palaces a man who has been my kind of a fool can appreciate his own fireside and gertie who was all aflutter to visit one of the famous broadway restaurants recognised in ten minutes the crass artificiality it took me years to discover he was holding her hand openly and unashamed as he said it thornley colton shook his head it is past my time for going home and you know my habits a glass of celestins at onefifteen the beauties of the moonlight sonata on my piano for fifteen minutes and then to bed if i may visit you at your home mrs simpson his outstretched hand met that of the girl ah you read the lips a wonderful accomplishment to us who have never had eyes his lips framed a smile of pleasure he turned to thames the same sydney he asked the secretarys eyes travelled up the aisle the man nine steps up is gesticulating quite freely lots of room colton s slim stick touched a chairleg he bowed and hurried away the hearty goodnight of simpson following thornley colton never needed any direction for going back over the same route for his mind trained to the figures of steps neither hesitated nor made mistakes in following them backward he stepped aside to avoid the swinging arm of the loudvoiced man who was punctuating his liquorborn blatancy with violent gestures and paused at the archway of the main diningroom for thames is morris still at his table he asked it is empty urn colton s high forehead wrinkled a frown his slim stick tapped his leg time enough tomorrow he announced finally and started through the maze of tables towards the entrance they received their hats and overcoats and left the big hotel to enter the long black car that awaited them at the north entrance at one oclock each morning they were well on their way to the big oldfashioned brownstone house where thornley colton had been born before the silence was broken then sydney thames spoke there must be a lot of latent goodness in a man who could take a woman like that to love and cherish and protect he said slowly you mean miss richmond the darkness concealed the whimsical smile on colton s lips no the negative was short morris will marry miss richmond just because she is beautiful and accomplished because his mans vanity will be tickled to exhibit her before men as his possession i mean simpson who took a simple country girl whom god had handicapped just because he loved her that means something but sydney colton s thin fingers rested lightly on the others sleeve there was just the faintest trace of laughter in the wordsdont you think she was a bit too heavily rouged he felt the highlystrung man jump under his hand good heavens thorn sydney burst out sometimes i wonder if you are blind god gives fingers to the sightless sydney colton s voice was quietly serious in the darkness the keyboard of my piano gives me the soul secrets of dead men gone to dust in the lights of a broadway restaurant the keyboard of silence gives me the secrets of living hearts and they cannot lie what do you mean what have i missed thames asked the questions eagerly tensely for he knew the moods of this man who had been the only father he had ever known he understood that something of grave portent had given its significance to the man who could not see while he with five perfect senses had seen nothing suspected nothing colton pulled his crystalless watch from his pocket and touched it with a fingertip onethirty we are fifteen minutes late he put his hand on the door catch as the big machine slowed up before his home and it was not until they were ascending the broad brownstone steps that he answered the question you have missed the first act of what promises to be a very remarkable crime sydney he said quietly ii colton scowled when the red jack failed to turn up but the mouth corners smiled when the ace of diamonds slid between the sensitive fingers to take its place in the top row of mr canfields famous game the deuce followed the red jack immediately after then the problemist looked up toward the doorway of the library well shrimp he smiled theys the theatrical papers yuh wanted the redheaded frecklefaced boy with the slightlytwisted nose came forward with an armful of big magazines and newspapers the front pages of which were adorned with fulllength portraits of stage celebrities before he quite reached the table he stopped short eyes crackling their excitement snakes youre gettin it mr colton theys the four of hearts and the five of spades dont stop now colton laughed all right shrimp do you want to do a little detective work for me do i the eyes danced with eagerness aint i been studyin nineteen steps from the kitchen t the first chair in the dininroom six i know assured colton hastily but you take those papers to your room and write down the names of all the vaudeville actorsmen you knowwho have quit the stage within the last two months where they have gone and why if possible snakes the boys face showed his disappointment nick carter never had t do that he never had to count steps for a blind man either smiled thornley colton you do that and therell probably be some real detective workshadowing disguises and the rest of it there was no answer the boy had taken a firmer grip on the papers and was already out of the room the four of hearts and the five of spades had been placed when sydney face broad in a smile entered whats the matter with the fee he demanded he ran past me as though he were on his way to a fire thames always referred to shrimp as the fee because the redheaded frecklefaced boy had become part of the colton household after a particularly baffling case at the conclusion of which the joy of capturing the murderer had been overshadowed by the blind mans sorrow for the brokennosed boy who had jumped between him and a vicious blackjack and shrimp had been his fee for the case as the boys mother was the murdered one and his father the murderer there had been no one to object before colton had a chance to voice his laughing explanation the tinkling telephonebell on the desk demanded attention at the first words the thin lips tautened to a straight line the voice became pistollike in its crispness the muscles under the pale skin of the face became tense the problemist had a problem when last night all right still that twowire burglar connection on the safe never mind further details well be right down as his hand dropped the receiver on the hook a finger pressed the garage bell button that would bring his machine instantly at any hour of the day or night get your hat and coat sydney he ordered curtly were going to the berkley trust company somebodys gotten away with half a million in negotiable bonds half a million gasped thames so they said didnt wait for details colton grabbed his private phonebook of oftenneeded numbers and ran his fingers down the backs of the thin pages on which the names and numbers had been heavily written with a hard pencil as sydney hurried out he heard the curt voice give a number over the phone and it was fully five minutes before colton took his place in the car in the smoothrunning machine with the woodenfaced irish chauffeur at the wheel sydney thames voiced the question last night you said yes the second act came sooner than i expected broke in thornley colton i underrated the man and the expression on the pale face augured ill for some one the funereal atmosphere of the berkley trust company could be felt as they entered in the office of the third secretary the whitehaired president of the institution stopped his nervous pacing to mumble a greeting in tremulous accents first vicepresident simpsons grave face broke into a smile of welcome norris raised his bowed head from his hands and came forward joyfully pleadingly the redfaced man who had been standing over him kept a step away but always near enough to touch him with an outstretched hand my god mr colton they think im guilty there was agony unutterable in morriss voice ridiculous snapped simpson his heavylidded eyes half closed mr colton will soon put this detective right the problemist nodded a grim acquiescence and took the outstretched hand of norris i know better he said kindly the redfaced man gave voice to a grunt and colton instantly swung around to face him so youve cleaned it up already jamison he asked mildly nobody said he was guilty growled the redfaced centraloffice man significantly i just been questionin him thats all and accusing him with every question snapped colton like the rest of your kind you havent the intelligence to suit your methods to the crime every crime must be worked according to the old mulberry street formula that didnt change with the modern centre street building but we know enough not to make any cracks till we get all the information sneered jamison we dont hand out that knowitall stuff till we know something true smiled the problemist with his lips but there was no smile in his tone two hectic spots glowed in his cheeks the muscles worked under the pale skin what do you think president montrose the whitehaired president halted his pacing once more and stroked his vandyke the first stain on the unsullied escutcheon of the berkley trust company he groaned in all of the half century i know all that broke in colton impatiently what happened why are the police here instead of the protectiveagency men i was excited moaned the president it was the first thing that occurred to me in all the half century of i guess we were all excited interjected simpson his lips twisted in a wry smile i know i was up in the air i came down here happier than i ever was before in my life to arrange for a short vacation to take a wedding trip now this comes up when i came to my senses i telephoned for you because i want the robbery solved as soon as possible the little girl has banked so much on our little time too bad murmured colton tell me the story norris before he could get an answer he turned to thames who always stayed discreetly in the background when colton was on a case see that no one goes near that safe sydney i may want to examine it kind of dropped that bluff of bein blind aint you sneered jamison who was one of the hundreds of persons in new york who would not believe that thornley colton was really sightless and the problemist did not deign to explain that once he had been in a room and touched its objects with his cane his trained brain held the correct mental picture for ever the bonds were fifty in number ten thousand each government fours negotiable anywhere began norris licking his dry lips to make the words come easier they were the bulk of the stillson estate on which i was working we are settling it up as third secretary my work is with trusts and estates it was necessary to have everything finished by tonight i worked late yesterday so late that the bonds and other papers could not go into the timelocked vaults and i had to be at work on them this morning before the clockrelease time is it customary to keep valuable bonds in the small safe in this office interrupted colton it is not unusual the safe is practically as strong as the big vaults and only lacks the clocks this office is really part of the vault itself the walls are windowless and of fourfoot concrete reinforced by interlocked steel rails the sheetsteel door the only entrance to the room opens into a small cage that is occupied during the day by thompson head of the trust and estate routine clerks and at night by one of our two watchmen the watchmen never leave it because it often happens that valuable papers and bonds are left out of the big vaults so that we can work on them before nine oclock the hour set on the vaults clocks to get to the steel door of this office one would have to enter the outer and inner steel cages the steelbarred door of the small anteroom besides setting off burglaralarms on all disturbing the watchman and ringing the bells in the burglaralarm department of the bankers protective association of which we are a member and there was no sign of a break the safe was opened with the combination that only mr montrose and mr simpson and myself know the watchman could get to this door without any trouble both have been in the employ of the bank for forty years they are absolutely above suspicion both are illiterate even though they could enter the office they could not open the safe and even if they did that they would not know enough to steal all the notes i had made regarding the estate or the bonds that have so utterly vanished they have been sent for however and should be here any minute were the notes you made stolen too all of them any of the other employees of the bank know the bonds were in this safe several probably all have access to this room at any time only thomas the head of the t and e clerks trustworthy he grew up with the bank you require other clerical assistance at times thomas takes the papers from this office and the clerks get them from him outside all must be returned to me before closing time i carefully checked over every one last night before any of them went away any one in here yesterday while you were at work on the papers any one who could have seen the bonds for a moment there was no answer then it came almost in a whisper miss richmond and her mother were in for a few moments and i was too by jove the interruption came from simpson and i remember asking you how you were getting on with the stillson estate i just finished my part when i went away i guess i really held them up longer than i should has miss richmond been sent for colton paid absolutely no heed to the first vicepresident a grunting laugh from the detective she sure has bo after i found out this guys stage lady had been in here with a tailors suitbox after closin time my partner went right up to her hotel by heaven you norris rose to his feet face black with fury colton s hand on his shoulder forced him back into the chair sydney thames to whom all women were angels clenched his fists is that true there was a new tone to colton s voice norris seemed to recognise the menace she isnt guilty i tell you she cant be sheslisten man shes my wife your wife they all echoed it the detective with laughing triumph president montrose with horror sydney thames in dazed surprise simpson with a halfsuppressed significant gasp we were married two days ago but it was to be a secret until the end of her season how long ago was she sent for the detective answered my side kick ought to be back now we was on the job there all right all right voices outside came to their earsthe harsh commanding voice of a man the halfsubdued sobbing of a woman the door was thrown open and rhoda richmond operasinger and wife of norris was half pushed half carried into the small room good work jim grinned jamison did she put up a howl at the hotel hotel growled the other scornfully no hotel for her i had a lot of luck or id neverve got her she was boardin a boat fer south america that sails in an hour its a lie norris screamed the words as he leaped toward the man whose rough hand was clenched around the slim arm of the girl sydney thames obeying colton s silent signal forced him back his own hands trembling the problemist without a word untwisted the centraloffice mans fingers and gently seated the girl in a chair at the long table who the the blustering detective was cut off suddenly weve had enough of your strongarm methods colton s voice was hard as flint well get some facts now the hardness vanished in its place came gentle sympathy when did you get the message miss richmond he asked the voice seemed to have the reassuring effect of a pat on the head of a hurt child with an effort the girl controlled her sobs and answered as though it had been the most natural question in the world an hour agoover the telephonei thought i recognised howmr norriss voice he wanted me to meet him at the buenos aires dock he had to go to south america secretly he said and i must tell no one i hurried to the dock without even telling mother i waited for an hour but he did not come then i decided to go aboard and see if he had missed me and gone to his state room this mansaid howard hadrobbedi thought she broke down again i guess thats bad grinned jamison gloatingly in another hour thered of been a clean getaway the whereabouts of the bonds doesnt seem to worry you snapped colton sarcastically the stuff aint never far away from the guy that took it growled jamison when you get through your knowitall talk well sweat that out all right did you have a tailors suitbox with you yesterday asked colton abruptly of the girl yes i called to see if my new walkingsuit was finished it was all ready to be sent to my home but when i saw the poor tired little boy who would have to carry it i took it myself the tailor is just around the corner on the avenue that is why mother and i dropped in here of course nodded colton his teeth snapping together as he seemed to sense the derisive grins on the faces of the detectives did you recognise the bonds among the papers on which mr norris was working oh he showed them to me and we laughingly spoke of what we could do with half a million dollars then when he took mother out to show her around the banki was too tiredi picked one up and read it rhoda cried norris he could realise the present significance of yesterdays innocent words thatll be about all from you scowled jamison if this guy wants to thirddegree her and cinch it for us let him an if he dont cinch it this will the other detective pulled a paper from his pocket heres the buenos aires s passenger list and heres mr and mrs frank morris who booked yesterday added in pencil morris for norris slick enough to be almost good every one in the room but colton seemed to be shocked into a state of stupefied rigidity now jamison said that word in the tone one uses to introduce some especially clever thing and accompanied it with a sarcastic glance toward the blind man who tapped his trouser leg with his cane in thoughtful silence if you aint got no objection well take these two to headquarters and get a line on where they got the stuff cached he paused suggestively mockingly the permission came with a deprecatory wave of the cane and a smile that was menacing in its very suaveness go as far as you like jamison dont be too gentle with them my god mr colton you dont think the words choked in norriss throat i think you had better go the problemists tone was peculiarly quiet jamison and his partner have the reputation of being the two wealthiest detectives in the department no one knows how they got it but theyve enough to give you and your wife a twentythousanddollar nest egg each on a falsearrest suit isnt that worth a few hours discomfort i can prove your innocence when they have gone they worry me here simpson whistled and turned it into a jerky laugh gad that was clever he exclaimed oh is that so the detectives chorused it in their voices sarcasmand just a tinge of something else too colton knew the one thing that would make them stop and think are you going snapped colton well see them two watchmen first growled jamison good the problemist laughed at the sudden change i think youll have quite a crowd to take down to headquarters if you hang around long enough before i started i telephoned to the burglaralarm telegraph department of the protective agency to get hold of the men who answered the alarm that rang in from this office early this morning what burglaralarm snarled jamison he whirled on the whitehaired president why didnt you tell us there was an alarm rung in reallythe vandyke received several severe yanksi didnt know it we do not receive the clock reports and emergency alarm sheets until about noon ermr colton might i ask where you got this information i telephoned for it answered colton curtly if these policemen hadnt been so anxious to make arrests and the robbery hadnt been too obvious for their thick heads they might have investigated but they are just headquarters men the obvious arrest is the one they always make feet make good centraloffice men not heads ah here are the men all together they came in slowly two old men first one with straggly white whiskers that concealed the weak chin and grew up around the faded watery eyes the others parchmentlike face a network of wrinkles honesty shone from every part of them the weak helpless honesty of their kind as colton took each mans hand with a murmured greeting he felt it tremble in his the aged watchmen knew that something had happened something that concerned them and the bank they had guarded so long the two men from the burglaralarm company nodded to the two detectives and their eyes narrowed as they shook the hand of the problemist both knew him and both knew this had been no common summons thornley colton never bothered with common things sydney thames had pulled two chairs up to the table and the old men sat down colton lighted a cigarette thoughtfully then he spoke this morning gentlemen that small safe was robbed of five hundred thousand dollars worth of government bonds his slim cane apparently held idly between his fingers touching the chair of the man nearest him felt the watchmans involuntary jump the others saw the old jaws drop saw the watchmen glance helplessly at each other their trembling fingers picking at worn trouserknees colton heard the gasp of the two protectiveagency men i knowed it quavered the whitewhiskered watchman i knowed somethingd happen when mary took sick whos mary queried colton interestedly the others crowded forward shes mary my wife shes been scrubbin the bank floors fer thirty years an nobody ever said a word against her he glanced at them all with pathetic belligerence she even picked up the pins she found on the floor and put em in a box on the cashiers desk thats true laughed simpson its the joke of the bank and she was taken sick last night thornley asked gently a week ago the other watchman answered while the first brushed his dry lips with his workgnarled hand mrs bowden shes got the consumption and lives across the hall from us and where do you live interrupted colton sixteen hundred third avenue i been boardin with him an his wife fer thirty years mrs bowdens been doing marys work we didnt say nothin about mary bein sick cause she might get laid off an mrs bowdens awful poor his voice was a childish quavering treble last night after mrs bowden had gained your confidence you allowed her to scrub mr norriss office encouraged colton norris started id forgotten that he ejaculated a motion from colton commanded silence yes trembled marys husband john opened the door an started to punch his clocks an i stayed in the anteroom like i allus do to watch mrs bowden then somehow the door got closed an mrs bowden got scared there in the dark she screamed an cried till it was real sad but john had the key an he had to punch his clocks on the minute er mr montrosed be mad when he got the records next day an i couldnt leave my place in the anteroom so i encouraged her sayin that johnld be back in half an hour an let her out she quieted after a while an didnt scream so loud but i could hear her stumblin around then john had to run to the front door to see who was knockin an he let these gentlemen in the burglaralarm on the safe had rung they said an never mind that part halted colton one of these men will tell me that part we was called at seveneighteen began the taller of the two bankers protective agency men by the safe bell the safe is connected with one wire and under the carpet running all around the safe is a thin steel plate connected with the other a man standing near enough to touch the safe forms a connection that rings our gong in the daytime of course we pull the switch we got here and found the door locked an we could hear moaning this guyhe indicated the one with the straggly beardunlocked the door and behind it was a woman her skirt pinned up around her laying on the floor frightened to death when she seen us she jumped to her feet with a little screech and muttered something about thanking god you were satisfied that she was frightened sure but we didnt let it go at that we snapped on every light and examined the room nothing had been touched we frisked the woman gentle of course but enough to know that she hadnt a thing on her we finally got it out of her that shed fell against the safe trying to find the door in the dark she didnt know enough to snap on a light she couldnt have had fifty tenthousanddollar bonds on her person both men laughed gee mr colton laughed the short one she was so frail you could almost see through her she couldnt hardly have hid a cigarette paper without making a hump what happened then she picked up the pail she hadit was full of dirty scrub water and the yellow bar of soap was bobbing around in itand john here took her into the cashiers cage we hung around talking an watching her scrub and weep into the pail until it was time fer her to go home she was so all in i put her on a car urn colton puffed his cigarette in silence then he turned to jamison and his partner looks mighty suspicious doesnt it jamison id advise you to arrest these four men and get the woman five hundred thousand is likely to make any honest man a crook some kidder aint you sneered jamison i know pete there an if he says it was all right it was we got the guilty parties first off an well get the stuff too the smile went from coltons lips instantly you arrest them and well start falsearrest proceedings in an hour he warned you leave morris and miss richmond here any one but a fool detective would know they werent guilty as he said the last word he jumped toward the safe ran his highly sensitive fingers over the steel surface knelt down brushed the heavy carpet lightly with his fingertips the two hectic spots on his cheeks glowed redder the nostrils quivered like those of a hound on the scent even the eyes behind the great round smoked glass lenses seemed to shine silently they watched him he lowered his face almost to the floor the cane was laid down and his hand gave the carpet a resounding slap they crowded closer one hand went to his hippocket a handkerchief brushed the hardwood floor under the safe between the edge of the rug and the wall he rose touched the burning end of his cigarette ever so lightly to the linen handkerchief that was now covered with a fine yellow powder see it see it he snapped you couldnt before because it was the same colour as the hardwood floor its woodpolish powder used for cleaning the varnished wood sneered jamison stepping forward we dont want smell it then the blind man thrust the handkerchief under the centraloffice mans nose do you recognise it now its sulphur ordinary powdered sulphur the thing that would tell any man how the bonds were taken out of the office go to a drug store and find out what sulphur is used for he thrust the handkerchief into his coatpocket brushed off the knees of his trousers and picked up his stick come sydney he said quietly weve finished before the astonished men could make move or protest he hurried from the office automatically counting the steps he jumped into the waiting machine sydney thames followed and as simpson and jamison ran to the door he snapped home john to the irish chauffeur and the machine sped away around the first corner he leaned forward sixteen hundred third avenuequick he ordered you dont think those two old watchmen guilty asked thames in surprise no the tone was almost brusque merely an unimportant detail i want to clear up you certainly left that crowd in the office at sixes and sevens thames laughed at the recollection i intended to thats why i went into all those details i wanted to leave every one up in the air especially the two detectives theyll begin to think now and they wont let any one get away before we have made this call i want to think now sydney thames knew the moods of the blind man knew he could expect no explanations or even replies until colton was ready to give them so they sped in silence to the upper east side soon they were on upper third avenue overhead the clanking l trains pounded their din into the two mens ears the streets were crowded with their heterogeneous mass of men women and children the rusty fireescapes staggered drunkenly across the dirty red tenementfronts the look of tense concentration left coltons face a far cry from the luxurious staidly conservative berkley trust eh sydney he smiled leaning back in the cushions puffing his cigarette as though untroubled by a serious thought his eyes behind the smoked library glasses seemingly fixed on the narrow strip of blue sky overhead the car came to a stop is this it john th saloon on th corner is fifteenninetyfour sorr lead the way sydney again the twin red spots glowed in coltons white cheeks he jumped to the sidewalk his slim stick tapping his trouserleg eagerly thames stepped along beside him close enough for his coatsleeve to touch that of thornley colton and with that slight touch to guide him the problemist followed for thornley colton was a trifle sensitive over his blindness and nothing made him angrier than an attempt to lead him sydney found the entrance between a secondhandclothing store and a pawnbrokers shop as he stopped to make sure of the weatherdimmed painted number the clothingstore proprietor popped out rubbing his dirty palms together and coughing apologetically on which floor does mrs bowden live asked colton sharply der fourf front you maybe like some cloes is her husband watchman at the berkley trust company hes dead you means mrs schneider across the hall her man watches dere boarder also you like a elegant skirt for der poor vimens such a thames opened the door and they left the clothing man in the middle of his sentence in the dark hall sydney made his way cautiously colton cane lightly touching the heels of the man ahead followed unhesitatingly the journey up the rickety steps was torture to colton to his doubly acute ears and sense of smell the odours the squalling of halfstarved babies were terrible but his brain automatically counted the steps so that he would have not the slightest difficulty in finding his way back to the automobile schneider first whispered colton as thames stopped in the fourthfloor hall in the dim light thames saw that they were standing between two doors i dont know which it is but ill take a chance he knocked on the one at his left the one behind immediately popped open mrs bowdens gone away shrilly proclaimed a tottery old woman bobbing her head could you give us her address asked colton doffing his hat and bowing politely laws the womans fluttering hand set her spectacles farther askew in a hurried effort to straighten them shes gone to spend the day with her sister in brooklyn them boys of mine pestered her till shes near sick and she bein so delicat an out late last night washin dishes at the church sociable are you mrs schneider the darkness hid the smile the reference to the boys had caused im her be you the associated charities mis bowden said shed asked fer help she came here two weeks ago after losin her job in the department store on account of her weak lungs she had to take in odd days work asthma she calls it but i aint fooled on consumption two of my and you helped her by pretending you were ill interrupted colton i was sick fer two days the woman hastened to set him right but she was so powerful glad to earn a few cents fer her asthma snuff not that it is asthma my sisters brother of course she left the key with you until her return colton left the sisters brother in midair yes but there was just a shade of suspicion in the voice as agents of the associated charities we must make an examination of the room to prove that she is really in need of financial help assured colton gravely we can wait until she returns of course but this is the last application day for this month laws ill get it right away she darted back into the room with surprising agility and returned a moment later with an iron key tied to a brokentined fork theres no need of bothering you mrs schneider declared colton earnestly as thames took the key laws soons i get these pataters on ill be right with you my boys had to go down to their bank the rest of the sentence was lost for as she turned to the stove colton had jerked thames from the door quick he whispered in an instant the key was in the lock and the door was open colton pushed his way in his cane touching the scarred tumbled bed and the one broken chair wheres the trunk he queried cane feeling around no sign of one nor a case damn snapped colton the bureau drawers see what your eyes find thames had the top drawer open almost before he had finished he whistled in amazement nothing but an empty pillbox with no druggists label three quills with the feathers cut off and a tuft of cotton what the those are what i want put them in your pocket the tenseness went out of his voice it became politely ingratiating for his keen ears had heard the woman coming there is no doubt that mrs bowden is in need of our assistance mrs schneider he said smoothly eris that some of her asthma snuff in the top bureaudrawer she ran past him and bobbed her head over the open drawer yes sir there is a little sprinkled over the bottom you got mighty powerful eyes mister she nodded vigorously at the blind man he had not been within five feet of the bureau shes dead set on it bein asthma but my sisters brother was do you know anything against mrs bowdens character again the sisters brother was left dangling laws no shes that frightened shes afraid of her own shadow im the ony one in the house she took to an even me she kept at a distance another vigorous nod an so modest laws she wouldnt ha come into the halls half dressed like some of the other women does an clean laws she lugged all her cloes over to her sisters in brooklyn today to be washed in their thirtieth century washer not that i ah thank you but we have four other calls to make and bowing gravely colton backed from the room and hurried toward the head of the stairs followed by thames and the shrillvoiced encomiums of the woman they took their places in the car silently and it was not until they had left the noise of the avenue for the quiet of the sidestreets that colton spoke what do you think of it sydney asked the problemist gravely im completely at sea confessed thames with a shake of his head it looked awfully bad for norris when we arrived at the bank then that south american boat business how did you know she had received a message he asked suddenly didnt but i knew miss richmond or rather mrs norris common sense would have told any one that could be the only reason for her presence at the dock jamison and his kind dont use common sense they use the old policemans formula arrest the logical suspect and then convict him with persons like norris and his wife each half doubting half suspecting either would have confessed to save the other it was an ideal arrest from the police viewpoint then you seemed to involve the two watchmen and the two men from the protective agency jamison will have a whole waggonload hell take no one answered colton i know him hell spend the rest of the day trying to find out what i was talking about then hell telephone to headquarters and theyll send men to find out who sent the message to miss richmond and to locate mrs bowden theres the woman thorn thames spoke nervously excitedly she took a dresssuit case presumably full of clothes to her sister in brooklyn the bonds you forget that the agency men saw her come out of the room emptyhanded they even searched her and one put her on the trolley colton smiled curiously this was wholly a mans job sydney the work of the rarest kind of criminal a detailist this crime while perfectly simple is i think unique in its attention to details thats why it interests me simple ejaculated thames simple you speak as though you knew the guilty man i do perfectly i knew last night last night the the robbery was committed early today exactly whywhy helpless amazement was in sydney thamess voice why dont you arrest him why all this simply because i would be laughed at i havent the proofyet the usual criminal stumbles on his opportunity and seizes it in a haphazard fashion the rare criminal the detailist attends to every detail works his problem out with the shrewdness and forethought of a captain of finance plans a coup months ahead then he creates the opportunity you must understand sydney that half a million is worth a few months work but suspicion points only to miss richmond norris and this mrs bowden suspicion points to every one corrected the problemist doesnt it seem suspicious that president montrose should call in the police when he would naturally take all steps in his power to avoid publicity doesnt the very eagerness of the centraloffice men to arrest norris and his wife seem queer isnt there a bit of suspicion in simpsons confession that he delayed the stillson estate until norris was compelled to work after hours on them doesnt miss richmonds story that she was carrying her suit home to save work for a delivery boy seem highly improbable and unwomanlike how about norris telling his wife of the bonds an unbusinesslike proceeding in the case of half a millions worth of negotiable bonds truly didnt the two men who answered the earlymorning alarm seem a bit too sure that nothing was wrong werent the two watchmen in the conspiracy to pretend that mrs schneider was ill so that a woman whom they had known but two weeks could gain access to the bank doesnt the finding of an unlabelled pillbox three featherless quills and surgeons cotton in the otherwise empty room of a woman dying with tuberculosis strike you as strange as a further detail in this crime of details doesnt my confession that i knew the criminal before the crime was committed seem a trifle like guilty knowledge he smiled broadly great scott thorn sydney thamess voice trailed off in a whistle of pure bewilderment youve involved every one oh no colton snapped his cigarette into the street not every one an unfortunate vaudeville actor will appear on the scene as soon as i get the list on which i left shrimp busily at work iii in the absolute darkness of the shadedrawn library thornley colton softly whistled a syncopated version of mendelssohns spring song as his deft fingers filled an empty goosequill with a fine white powder from an improvised paper funnel he plugged the open end with a small wad of cotton then his wonderfully sharp ears caught the rustle of the double portieres oh sydney he called have you heard anything from the bank this morning thames entered the darkness unhesitatingly for his constant practice of judging distance and figuring steps for colton had made him almost as much at home in the darkness as the blind man himself no he answered shortly then with the frank criticism of long friendship its a crime thorn for you to be idle while that girl is being dogged and harassed and i thought she sang remarkably well last night for a person under such a strain interrupted colton musingly it was wonderful wonderful sydney thames spoke with the breathless enthusiasm a beautiful girl always aroused in his womanhungry heart here here protested the problemist laughingly remember that she is another mans wife great heavens thorn how can you laugh cried thames resentfully think of those two dogs of detectives questioning bulldozing shadowing why they didnt let miss richmond get away from the bank until late in the afternoon then jamison insisted on going with her his partner hung around the bank till it closed trying to discover the use of powdered sulphur smiled colton i thought he would any one but a centraloffice man would have gone to a drug store as i suggested two other headquarters men hauled that frail old mrs schneider and the two watchmen to police headquarters and put them through the third degree and a halfdozen more were on the trail of mrs bowden while we were enjoying the opera and an alleged cabaret show afterward for which this dark room is the penalty too much light yesterday gave me a frightful headache the sudden ringing of the telephone in the darkness made thames jump and colton s cane which was never away from him felt the movement answer it sydney he requested the secretarys hands had not the sureness of his feet and he had to fumble a moment when he had given the customary salutation and had listened a moment he gasped its simpson thorn his wife is missing he wants you he extended the phone in the darkness but thornley colton made no move to take it tell him ill be down to the bank in an hour or so ill see him then colton spoke idly sydney repeated the message followed a silence hes frantic thorn thames s voice shook with excitement when he got home last night she was gone the doorman at his apartment house said that she had gone out in the morning for a short walk he supposed simpson was so excited about the robbery he did not telephone her during the day as he had promised he spent half the night searching and tried a dozen times to get you she is deaf and dumb thorn think of it deaf and dumb and lost it only needed a woman in trouble to shatter sydney thamess nerves tell him that im trying to figure out that robbery tell him also that i never let one case interfere with another im not a detective theres nothing interesting about a missing woman hundreds of em every day i find my pleasure in interesting problems not in police work colton s voice was sharp curt utterly devoid of sympathy sydney knew that tone as he knew the man who used it he repeated part of the message added gentlevoiced apologies and hung up the receiver with a sigh that was heartless thorn think of that woman deaf and dumb lost in this sometimes sydney that susceptible heart of yours becomes wearisome colton spoke a bit sharply a moment ago you were protesting because i was here instead of running around after the man who stole the halfmillion in bonds from the berkley trust company but mrs norris is not helpless and for fifteen minutes he argued while colton smiled imperturbably in the darkness and filled two other quills with the white powder and plugged the ends with tufts of cotton suddenly thames stopped for colton had picked up the telephone and was giving a number hello shrimp he called when the connection had been made everything all right fine business three hours eh good be on time and obey orders goodbye wheres the fee demanded sydney i havent seen him since yesterday emulating the example of his worthy hero nick carter shrimp is a real detective now colton returned the crystalless watch to his pocket picked up the three quills and arose come on sydney well walk over to the bank walk ejaculated thames for he knew the blind mans aversion to walking when he could ride wheres the machine john and the machine are helping shrimp in his detective work explained colton and in the twenty minutes walk to the berkley trust company he absolutely refused to answer questions but kept up a continuous conversation on trivial topics that was maddening to the nervous secretary the effect of the previous days badgering questioning and threats of the centraloffice men could be seen as one entered the bank the aged cashiers hands trembled as he tried to count a sheaf of new bills bookkeepers in the rear wrote figures and erased them thompson head of the trust and estate clerks in his little anteroom cage was in a pitiable state of nerves the typewriters chair by president montroses desk was vacant because the lady stenographer was at home under the care of a doctor the fifty years of staid conservative calm that had characterised the berkley trust company during its long and useful life had been hit by a fivehundredthousanddollar storm the group in the vaultlike office of third secretary norris was little better president montrose could hardly control his trembling hand to stroke his vandyke norriss eyes showed the sleeplessness of the night before miss richmond was calm with the calmness that means coming nervous collapse her mother was crying softly simpson seemed positively haggard and sydney thames murmured words of sympathy for the man who had two troubles jamison and the other centraloffice man could not make their sneers wholly sceptical the protectiveagency men were plainly puzzled i see you are all on hand there was no smile in colton s voice now or on his lips he was deadly calm coldly earnest you didnt think it necessary to send for the two watchmen we got men watchin them put in the surly jamison thanks came curtly from colton sit down at this table all of you i want to tell you a story we didnt come to hear simpson interrupted the detective for gods sake make it short mr colton my wife ill look into that later colton s cane assured him that the chairs were around the long table and his fingertips felt the face of his watch in his pocket will you simpsons voice was almost sarcastically eager his heavylidded eyes narrowed thames could not blame the mans natural resentment for colton s offhandedness silently they took seats colton sat facing the closed door across the table was simpson and norris miss richmond and her mother were at the end the four detectives were on either side of the problemist this is a story of a criminal who was born a criminal who couldnt be honest if he tried began colton in his quietly expressive voice one hand lay idly on the table before him the other on his knees fingers holding the slim hollow cane he wasnt just born crooked he started petty thieving before he was out of short trousers he was the rare criminal that works years as an honest man to pave the way for criminality he had brains he could have been a wonderful success as an honest man but he couldnt be straight the criminal instinct was there he was waiting for the proper time but the coarser side of his nature refused to be held in leash he needed money and with the inherent craft of his kind he began to plan the robbery of the berkley trust company it wasnt so hard because being an old conservative institution in which men had grown gray the personal side entered as it cannot in the modern uptodate institutions where men come and go instead of elaborate safeguards the simple protection of proven honesty entered largely into the protection of the banks valuables and where there is simple honesty there is always vulnerability this criminal had found the vulnerable spot years before the robbery was actually planned when the time came for its consummation luck came to his aid as it often does he paused on the outside door came a knock so faint that only his wonderfully sharp ears heard it there was no possibility of suspicion attaching itself to him for he had planned an elaborate program to foist suspicion on others and this robbery was but one of a series for the method his shrewd brain had devised was capable of endless combinations in a few years the berkley trust losses would have mounted to millions his fist crashed down on the heavy table the door opened between the soberfaced shrimp and the expressionless irish chauffeur was a sunkeneyed tottering creature unshaven theres your wife simpson in the silence colton s voice came like the crack of a pistol my god thorn its a man in sydney thamess tone was agony that the sensitive blind man whom he loved could have made such a mistake yes a man sit still simpson with a movement as quick as light itself colton s fingers had dropped the slim cane that had given its warning and held a bluesteel automatic or rather what was once a man his tone rang with deadly menace charlie de roque vaudeville actor the youngest and best female impersonator on the stage mrs bowden the consumptive who played so well on the sympathies of the three simpleminded souls at sixteen hundred third avenue mrs simpson the deafanddumb little girl who was going to make simpson lead a better life you lie the shambling shadow of a man screamed it as he tried to jerk away from the chauffeur they told me they were going to take me to a sanatorium i dont know what youre talking about theyve kept me his whole body racked with sobs would you tell the truth for these the automatic did not waver a fraction of an inch as coltons unoccupied hand threw down on the table three cottonplugged quills merciful god yes with insane strength he broke away from the big irishman and darted to the table his twitching fingers snatched a quill pulled the cotton from the end threw his head back enough of these damn theatrics simpson snarled it viciously but he did not move by heaven colton you cant railroad me to save morris and his wife with the fool ravings of a cocaine snuffler his face was purple the veins in his forehead seemed ready to burst mrs bowden he scoffed how did she get the bonds where are they find em he laughed triumphantly at colton across the table and the two centraloffice men who now stood over him here yuh are mr colton it was shrimp staggering under the weight of a big bucket of dirty water he set it down beside the problemists chair the bonds are here simpson coltons hand plunged into the water and came up with a dripping shiny black object theres the first package in an allrubber ice bag you devil simpsons rage made his voice a scream take your prisoner policemen colton could not refrain from adding that last scornful word to the two detectives who had not seen until a blind man had shown them iv of course de roque who was merely the drugcrazed tool of the real criminal would have told where the bonds were declared thornley colton when they were once more in the shadedrawn library of the big oldfashioned house but simpson would have had time to be on his guard the finding of the bonds as i did before he had time to recover his nerve drew from him those last betraying words the police can establish his connection with the telephone message to miss richmond the booking of the two passages under the name of morris and the place where he and de roque met while the fake mrs bowden was supposed to be out at days work those details were not even worth bothering with for me because the keyboard of silence told me the guilty persons before the robbery was committed i am as much at sea as ever confessed sydney thames in the regal we saw the first act simpson with the daredevilishness that characterises the type introduced me to the accomplice it was not wholly daredevilishness however for it was to prepare the getaway he wanted before the time came for her to disappear to arouse your sympathy and my interest in the deafanddumb woman whom he had married to accomplish his reformation after a fruitless search he would need a long vacation in europe with the bonds of course to recover from the shock there could be no suspicion attached to him no sane man would look for a deafanddumb wife in the person of a vaudeville actor dying of tuberculosis and cocaine who had drug dreams of money coming his way once simpson had gotten out of the country de roque could have raved and stormed even confessed and his confession would have been accepted as nothing but cocaine dementia simpson never intended to play fair it isnt his nature from the first time i ever shook his hand i have known him to be a born criminal for i can read hands as the physiognomist reads faces and i have the advantage because men like simpson with the aid of their strong wills can mask their emotions behind eyes and faces so that no man can read their minds but they have never given a thought to their hands do you mean to say you could tell what simpson was planning by shaking his hands there in the regal demanded thames incredulously not quite protested colton laughingly but you know how i shake hands my long index finger always rests lightly on the keyboard of silencethe wrist with a touch like mine so light that i can read handwriting by feeling the ridges left on the blank side of the paper not one person in a million could feel it i think miss richmond did when i shook hands with her because i felt a responsive thrill in the case of simpson his heart was working like a steamengine though his face and eyes were a mask that neither you nor any man with eyes could read my fingertip on his pulse told me that he was labouring under some strong excitement when i shook hands with his wife i discovered why why echoed thames blankly because the wife was a man and a drugfiend your hand told you that and my eyes were deceived my knowledge of anatomy told me the man part dont you know that over the muscles of a woman is a layer of fat that gives the beautiful feminine curves the mans muscles play directly under the skin and the curves of female impersonators are due to flabby muscles and not the feminine fat layer besides the cocaine pulse of the wife my fingertip immediately felt the play of the muscles as the hand gripped mine knowing simpson the impersonation could mean nothing else but a contemplated crime i further proved it by getting her to put out her hand before she could have had any knowledge by signs of my intention to say goodbye remember my reference to lipreading simpson was taking no chance of letting her talk the cocaine gave her the brightness of eye and the heavilydaubed rouge i knew would have to be there to convince you that she was really a country girl who didnt know the use of cosmetics and also to cover any trace of mans beard and cocaine pastiness of skin it would have deceived any one who had eyes where an artistic makeup would immediately have aroused suspicion simpson was a wonderful detailist common sense told me that simpson could not risk working with an amateur therefore i set shrimp to looking up actors who had been forced to leave the stage on account of ill health within the last two months the whole thing must have been rehearsed many times for the detailist would overlook no detail in shrimps list was de roque a few telephone inquiries proved that he was really a cocaine fiend of the worst kind also that he had returned yesterday morning from a sanatorium no better to his old boardinghouse it was simpsons scheme to let him do that for it eliminated him as soon as i found out that simpson would not risk visiting him shrimp and john got him on the pretence that they were from simpson cocaine snufflers as far gone as he need the drug every hour for three hours before the time arranged for shrimp to bring him to the bank de roque hadnt had a pinch he was insane with craving the visit to third avenue and the finding of the quills which cocaine snufflers use to hide the stuff on their bodies and conceal it in their palms so that no one can see them snuff it gave me the things i needed to make him talk you saw how they worked but the detectives who helped him out of the room how did you ever figure the possibility of the bonds being in the scrub water the protectiveagency men told me their eyes saw what my lack of eyes understood the yellow bar of soap bobbing on top of the water i think one of them expressed it an instants intelligent thought would tell any one that the yellow soap used for scrubbing floors never floats the finding of the powdered sulphur showed me the clever icebag trick for powdered sulphur is always used by druggists to keep the thin rubber from sticking together when the bags are in the boxes of course de roque carried it with him every night waiting for his opportunity and in pulling it out the powder scattered on the carpet the natural thing was to brush it under the safe where my handkerchief found it after my slapping hand had raised the scattered grains he had missed the ringing of the burglaralarm was a masterstroke it was the link necessary to establish the innocence of mrs bowden simpson of course knew of the connection de roque probably removed his shoes and stood on the rubber icebag while he opened the safe and took out the bonds and papers simpson had so accurately described then when they had all been packed and the safe closed a natural stumbling against the safe would bring the protectiveagency men to swear that nothing could have been taken from the room when the time came to leave the building the pail still full of water was carefully put in a far dark corner of the cellar closet where the scrub pails and mops are kept it would have been safe until simpson was ready to take the bonds away that was why i worked to keep jamison and his partner around the bank i didnt want simpson to have any opportunity to get the loot out of course it was he who suggested the calling of the regular police to the flustered president montrose because while he was sure that he could deceive me he wasnt taking any foolish risks he wanted the centraloffice men to muddle the thing as much as possible and he was shrewd enough not to overdo the casting of suspicion on norris and his wife the way he put in a word here and there and looks of course was quite in keeping with the other details this morning i think he had begun to realise what i was doing but there was nothing he could do but count on a bluff i took him off his guard for several minutes the two men smoked in silence but why didnt you warn some one instead of letting the robbery go on sydney asked finally colton s expressive lips framed a wry smile you will insist on showing the fly in the ointment sydney the truth is i was caught napping but i guess its just as well i didnt jails are built for the protection of society and simpson is the one man in a thousand against whom society needs protection richard sale with his profession providing a passport into many spheres of life the newspaperman is

stranger to violence despite his lighthearted nickname daffy dills adventures prove that when it comes to securing a scoop the fist is mightier than the pencil a nose for news one the telephone on my desk rang so i stopped banging out the lead of the double suicide story i had just covered and answered it it was dinah mason who is decidely bad for my heart she was the reception girl for the chronicle and she had buzzed me from the outer office hello garbo i said listen daffy she said in a low voice a lunatic just went by here yelling your name he looks angry i couldnt stop him thanks for the warning gel i said but im not on the spot for anythingas far as i can recall o k she sounded funereal he sure looks mad she hung up as did i and no sooner had i shoved the telephone back where it belonged than the door to the city room burst open and the maniac stalked in he was a little guy well dressed with a black derby perched on the top of his skull he was waving a home edition of the chronicle in his right hand like a red flag he kept saying which one of you is joe dill which one of you pencilpushers is joe dill i kept my mouth shut waiting for him to reach me before identifying myself and hoping that by that time some of the hot blood would have cooled off the rest of the staff in the tradition kept their pans a perfect blank if i wanted to make myself known that was my business alone but just then harry lyons the rat of our sheet who had been sore at me since i got his job gave me a dirty look and pointed at me his biggest aspiration you see was to find me flat on my face with a knife between my shoulder blades he said here he is mister meet daffy dill the worlds worst newspaper man i snapped button your lip lyons but he saw trouble for me he smirked broadly got up and took the maniac by the arm he pulled the guy right over to my desk and put a chair there for him here he said motioning at me is the cyrano de bergerac of the newspaper racket all noseno

turned stoically to lyons and asked with dignity where is the editor right this way lyons said smiling sweetly at me ill take you right in dont blame you a bit newspaper men shouldnt libel their readers youre absolutely right this way when he had gone in the vague direction of the old mans office i grabbed a stray copy of the chronicle and hurriedly thumbed through it to my story which had made a big enough hit with the old man to net me a byline i read it through carefully near the end i groaned it went like this adolph was famous long before he entered the cuisine of the grenada hotel for ten years before the war he was the most famous of all the crooks of vienna libel it was dynamite fuse lighted and all i had meant to say that he was the most famous cook in all vienna but somehow my typewriter must have slipped in that wandering r while i was pounding the keys i groaned i locked my desk got up and found my hat and coat i knew right then that i had joined the legion of the unemployed but somehow that word crook still rankled me i was damn positive that i hadnt written crook for cook and if i hadwhy hadnt the copyreader picked it up and fixed it suspicion grew and in five short minutes i realised that harry lyons c t cutthroat had pulled a sandy on me so i waited for him in a little while adolph came out of the old mans office with a happy expression on his faceas though he had just seen my corpse he sneered a sneer at me and left the city room no sooner had he gone out than lyons came to my desk why hello daffy he said the old man wants to see you right away you dont say i said and some one wants to see you right away too who is it he asked your favourite doctor i said with that i let him have a short sweet haymaker right under his eye which spot i had chosen previously there was a pleasant crunch his teeth clicked together neatly his eyes closed with a snap you could hear on west street he went down andout mcguire the sports editor looked up from the story he was writing about lou gehrig and yawned nice punch daffy better see the old man anyway he may have mercy on your soul thanks mac i said ill see him i went to the old mans office and

west fortythird and it is owned by mike cantrey alias the brain cantrey headed just about every racket on the main stem no murder beering or bootlegging not crude stuff like that he just took suckers he ran machines gambling houses spots like this one which were blinds for his crooked wheels in the rear and it was cantrey i had written my expose about i went in and took a seat by myself in one of the oaken stalls a waiter came over and looked questioningly at me i said an old fashioned garsong as ever while i was waiting for him i lighted a cigarette a shadow fell across my table i looked up a

ill name you as gobetween then ill take off from home in my plane tomorrow at pm and fly up to binneybunk maine where dad has a cabin itll be deserted there now after a week or two while you bask in

want to help you help me you want me to become a lifer in a federal jug clare wrinkled her nose all right but you cant stop me from doing it and ill write the ransom note and still name you as gobetween ill blow up the story and theyll pinch you for conspiracy or something im telling you daffy tomorrow at pm i hop off for maine and kidnap myself thems the kind words that gets back your job well she meant what she said i was sitting in my apartment the next night around eight thirty bemoaning the lack of scoops in this dazzling world i had had a hard day trying to find a story which would yank back my job but no luck my nose simply wasnt in the news i was washed up then my telephone rang i answered it with your nickel it was my heart dinah mason she thrust aside the usual sentimental amenities and said daffy hells broken loose somebody bomb the office i asked cheerfully its clare gordon dinah said shes been kidnapped half an hour ago she was taking off from her fathers estate out near huntington long island three men jumped her at least thats what the chauffeur says the snatchers piled into the plane and they all took off for points unknown i chuckled damn the gel any other fine points there was a ransom note left behind it names you as gobetween the bulls have been here for you theyre on their way up there now the old man is frantic trying to find you the last place we looked was home youre seldom there listen dinah i said dont get excited the gordon skirt framed this whole thing ill tell the old man when i see him it was putup are you sure daffy it doesnt look like a frame its a frame my chickadee i said forget it whos covering for the paper harry lyons oh me oh my i gloated what glorious fun abyssinia my hourglass look me up in atlanta i hung up threw on my hat and coat and took a powder before the police reached my place i wasnt any too soon either they roared up the street to the door sirens going just as i went down the block i caught a cab said headquarters mac and settled back on the cushions to enjoy the ride which cost me seventyfive cents when i finally paid off in front of the centre street building at the other end i went up to see captain george shane who i figured would be in charge of the case even if it had taken place on long island they centralise things like kidnappings because one man has to stand in with the federal authorities when they come searching inspector calloran and sergeant bill hanley of the homicide squad were both on the out in this snatch i was right captain shane was my man every newshound in the city was outside his door pounding on it trying to get in and get hold of some facts a copi recognised him as curly newtonwas pushing them aside in the midst of the holocaust i saw harry lyons he had a bad eye where i had brushed him off i said gentlemen of the press there was sudden silence they stopped pushing and turned around lyons yelled daffy dill and that started it i forgot for a moment that i had been named gobetween in clare gordons screwy ransom note i was a public figure in the case they mobbed me for a statement while curly newton tore into captain shanes office in a second or two before i could say a word newton came out again and dragged me through the mob into shanes office he closed the door and i liked the quiet for a change captain shane was pacing the floor in front of pemberton gordon clares father he recognised me easily since i had interviewed him for the paper only the week before as clare had said there were two other men in the room too they were federal operatives i could see it as plain as day daffy said captain shane you heard whats happened i nodded you heard youve been named gobetween i nodded again looking at pemberton gordons face he was scared to death his hands were trembling i could see a vein in his temple throbbing like hell i felt sorry for him listen captain i said i just heard about it and i came right down to blow it up its a fake a what a fake a pushover sandy its a frame the kid did it on purpose to help me get my job back captain shane stared at me daffy are you on the level you know me captain i said i dont lie to you then start talking he snapped lets hear this one i talked and told him all that had happened how id done the gel a favour i didnt say what it was because her old man was there and how she wanted to do something for me i told how she said shed kidnap herself name me as the gobetween sos id get the job back shane listened without saying anything just nodding now and then but i saw that pemberton gordon was regarding me with the kind of a look hed give frankensteins monster and the federal dicks were giving me the kind of eye which meant a rubber hose i prayed when i had finished captain shane shook his head daffy he said it sounds fishy ive known you a long time and all that but it sounds fishy i dont like to say itbut it does now come clean chief i said shortly thats clean i wouldnt fool you hes one of the gang gordon exclaimed i know hes one of the gang thats why he was named as gobetween he knows where clare is i want him arrested one of the feds said dont worry about that none wait a second i said take it easy boys im telling the gods honest truth i was sweating like a soda glass the girl is up at her fathers cabin at binneybunk maine why dont you check on that and see if im right shane nodded thats sound well do that little thing one of the feds snapped meanwhile said the other youre being detained as a material witness or suspicious character or anything youd like put him in the can captain thats what ill have to do daffy said shane sorry o k chief i said just so we clear the thing up i told that scatterbrained frill i wasnt in on it she said that wouldnt stop her well wire the binneybunk sheriff said captain shane sit tight in the jug youll know in an hour four they put me in a cell the minutes took a hell of a long time to pass i smoked i got to smoking so much i used a whole halfpack of cigarettes and my tongue felt like the russian army had walked across it with bayonets fixed i kept sweating and my hands were trembling i dont know why but i felt damned uneasy at ten oclock captain shane came to see me did they find her i asked daffy he said slowly i hate like hell to do this but pemberton gordon just swore out a warrant for your arrest youre charged with aiding in the kidnapping of one clare gordon and anything you say from now on can be used against you theyre setting your bail at twentyfive grand twentyfive grand i yelled arrest chief for gods sake listen the girl she wasnt there captain shane said the cabin hadnt been opened since gordon was up at binneybunk last summer i wilted oh i said oh thanks i was croaking not talking thanks chief ii guess im in a jam do me a favour will you sure he said get me some cigs please sure anything else telephonetelephone the old man tell him i want to see him captain shane shook his head no need of that daffy the old mans here he wants to see you can he captain shane shrugged o k i guess but only for five minutes thanks i nodded i felt better somehow the sweating stopped the suspense was killed i knew where i stood he went away in a few seconds the old man puffed up to my cell and stared at me daffy you old jailbird he said when i told you to go scoopy i didnt say get a life sentence doing it is it a story its a story i said but im the fall guy he looked me straight in the eye tell me one thing he said one thing daffy youre clean on this thing i said im clean chief good he chuckled then spill it i spilled it the whole damn thing and he listened taking in every news angle it had when i finished he remarked its a lulu all right itll make us dust off the type we used for the armistice but can you write it if i get a machine up here can you write that yarn can you he stopped and glanced warily at me wait a second if youhells bells the girl wasnt at the maine cabin that means shes really been snatched i nodded daffy he said watching my face do you know who did it ive got a good idea i said the old man got pale he paced back and forth a few minutes then he called be right back and left i felt for a cigarette but i didnt have any captain shane came along and slipped me a pack i paid him for them they hadnt taken my belongings yet thanks i said the old man showed up just at that instant youre free daffy he said i called up kennril he said that with the yarn behind it the chronicle was going to post bond for your bail thats legal all o k captain hell yes shane said the chronicle is good for twentyfive grand have you signed the papers no but i will now let the boy out not till the bond is posted they went off and fixed that business up while i jiggled on pins and needles every minute was precious after an awfully long wait the turnkey came and let me out the old man and shane were waiting for me in shanes office shane gave me a card in case other bulls tried to put the bite on me judas i said to the old man thanks thanks for everything ill never wait a second he said youve got to earn that bond go out and after them daffy and try to break it right for the noon edition say asked shane suspiciously does he know the snatchers i dont know a thing i said see my lawyer o k im on my way i shook hands with the old man i mean it chief thanks get to hell out of here the old man snapped i had a gun permit for a colt but i never carried the rod i figured i needed it tonight so i took a cab uptown to my place there was a cop out front i didnt want trouble i went in the back way and upstairs i found the rod all right primed and ready to go i slipped it in my coat pocket and went out the back way then i headed for the main stem crossed it and went into the hot spot i called a waiter is the brain in no the reply was surly rigo luke terk naw theyre all out o k i said i went out and turned into the back alley i knew if any one of the three came theyd go into the brains office the back way i took up a spot in the shadows and waited with my right hand wrapped fondly around my gun i waited about fifteen minutes it was ten after eleven by the paramount clock i heard footsteps come along the street i ducked back farther into the shadows a man turned into the alley he was all alone i recognised him rigo with his shortstepped gait i let the colt go i reached in my pocket and took out my penknife and snapped open the blade rigo was careful he took a good look around himself but it was damn dark where i stood he missed me he aimed for the side door of the hot spot and for one second he turned his back to me i jumped out of the shadows threw my left arm around his neck and jabbed the knife into his back just enough for him to feel the cold steel hello rigo i said nice seeing you again he was breathing hard he gasped who is it daffy dill i said an old friend i sneaked my left hand into his shoulder holster and put his gun in my pocket dont move you rat i snapped or ill give you the length of this blade he didnt move he asked whatre you after dill clare gordon i answered and the boys who snatched her he shuddered i could feel it he said wrong alley i dont know nothing about it listen you crumby little bun i snapped come clean im not kidding now the brain engineered this you overheard the gel say she was going to stage a fake you were taking it out on her because i got that i o u of her brothers back that and the fact that i wrote those gambling expose articles which will blow your business to hell you needed a new racket and the brain chose this one youre crazy he said rigo i said coldly where is she i tell you i dont know i took the knife and cut him deep across the back of the neck the blood started running down over his shirt rigo i said youre going to tell me or ill cut your head off come clean where is she i tell you i dontknow his voice was shrill and he was breathing hard from the pain that pup was scared to death want another cut i asked leave me alone for gods sake leave me alone i dont know anything about it i told you i cut him again on the back of the neck deeper this time he winced and began to half sob from the pain for gods sake dill are you crazy leave me alone where is she i dont i put the edge of the blade across the front of his throat i tightened it there rigo i said im going to tell you a little secret im out on bail im charged with clare gordons snatch if i dont find out from you where she is im due for either a death sentence or a lifer term i dont know where she is i havent got much to lose rigo i said coldly i pressed the knife harder your jugular vein is right there if you dont spill her location in ten seconds im going to slice your throat wide open and let you bleed to death thats murder dill sure i said but what have i got to lose your ten seconds are up here goes so long rigo i cut him slightly he half screamed and tried to break away from me i listened to his shrill words as he got hysterical with terror shes at the brains place shes at the brains place take it easy i said easing up on the blade what do you mean the brains place he babbled uptown ritz towers the brains penthouse its funny how fear will make a guy squeal on his own mother i kept the knife on him but just enough for him to feel it howd she get there i asked you snatched her when she was taking off in her plane from huntington long island the brain and luke terk engineered the snatch over there i waited up at yonkers with a speedboat who piloted cantrey the brain he was gasping what then cantrey set the crate down in the hudson he had flares was it an amphibian yeah land and water we broke the pontoons and let the crate sink then we came down the river in the speedboat i had left the brains lincoln by the fiftyseventh street pier we tied up the boat and got in the car we took the gordon doll up to the brains place i came back here to make things look right thanks i said for the interesting lecture five i took out his rod and cracked him on the skull with it he went out like a light and sagged to the alley floor i figured him cold for at least an hour i ran down the street to a cigar store stuck a nickel in a telephone and called dinah mason hello she said its daffy i said darling she said whats happened to you the old man got word that you were being held in connection listen my little rattlesnake i said i just put the bite on rigo you know rigothe brains right or left hand i forget which anyway he opened up and squealed beautifully now get this because im on my way clare gordon is being held captive at mike cantreys penthouse apartment at the ritz towers in case they should bury me before you see me again tell some one else that pertinent information and write the story along with my obit check she said be careful you lunatic dont get killed just when ive got you that way about me im not going to try i said but you never can tell i hung up and hooked a cab for uptown we made the ritz towers in nothing flat i paid off the driverfour bits it wasand i went in i found out how the brain got clare up there without suspicion he had a private elevator to his place i said i wanted to see him they made a call upstairs the answer said the desk clerk is no mr cantrey is seeing no one tonight tell him i said its about some gambling articles a fellow once wrote hell see you the desk clerk said after relaying the kind words take that elevator i took it it was a nonstop at that time of night and we went up so fast i felt as though id left my stomach on the first floor i got out i didnt have any plan i was just planning on inspiration there were only two of them i knew that the brain didnt go in for mobs i rang the bell luke terk opened the door hello rat he said i went in he had a gun in his right hand with the other as i passed him he frisked me he found my colt and made me take it out drop it on the floor i dropped it i felt sort of empty i had counted on that gun for a jam o k luke terk said then go on in one funny move and i give it to you his voice was cold and low he meant it the brain was sitting in the living room it was a swanky spot all furnished modernistic the way the furniture looks when you wake up with the jitters and a bad hangover he smiled at me in a selfsatisfied way i had a feeling i was in for it come to the point he said never mind the gambling stories stall all right i said you snatched clare gordon the gels here i want her you want the moon said the brain softly maybe so i said but i want her she aint here i laughed nervously youre stalling now cantrey i hopped rigo in an alley he squealed i know the brain said you cut him with your knife sorta nasty trick wasnt it daffy i felt icy so he came to and called you yeah hes got a tough skull sorta nasty wasnt it not for a rat like rigo i said he had it coming i dont like snatchers brain my my luke terk exclaimed he dont like snatchers his voice went taut well i dont like guys with knives dill he had it coming and so have you said the brain ever had your teeth burned with matches ever had needles stuck through your skin we do that with welchers daffy i think well stretch a point maybe you aint a welcher but you was pretty rough on rigo and rigo is a pal of mine see youre running a sandy i said you cant scare me now go ahead torture me then bump me off the feds are still after clare gordon they dont miss out on their cases brain she aint here sure i said shes flew away with a little birdie dont kid me shes in the ritz towers somewhere rigo squealed once hell squeal again the feds dont carve guys throats snapped luke terk rigos o k said the brain but youre not daffy youre washed out youve poked that big nose of yours into trouble this time into news i said a nose for news you stuck it into a coffin said luke terk only this time the lids on it and you cant pull out i waited for a second and didnt say anything they had the drop on me coming and going and there wasnt a thing i could do except bluff and stall a little i want clare gordon i said nuts luke terk growled o k chief the brain nodded o k luke give it to him and make it hurt luke terk jabbed his gun in my ribs get over to that sofa he said and lie down i started for the sofa simultaneously there was a hell of a racket in the streets below we were up some sixteen floors but we could hear the police sirens as plain as day they were screaming and i could hear the cars grinding up to the curb the gun in my ribs loosened luke terk tensed and turned chief he snapped bulls this lug mustve tipped them off take it easy the brain said maybe theyre not for us theyre for you i said i tipped them luke terk cried chiefwhatll we do with him take him along the brain said you take him down where the doll is ill stay here and parley with the cops you now was the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party i spun around swinging with my right it was a good swing but i hit without a target since luke terk and his rod were behind me i heard the brain yell i missed terks chin and hit him on the left shoulder six the punch hurt my fist it hit solidly luke terk went down but i had fired the arm so hard i fell right on top of him i hit him again as we sprawled this time i caught him on the beak it spouted blood he tried to bring his gun hand up the brain yelled again then there was a shot the bullet went over my back with an angry whine if you dont think slugs make noise you want to get that close to one of them i shot out my foot and smashed it down on luke terks hand terk yelled with pain and his fingers shot open the gun dropped to the rug another shot from the brain the rug in front of terks head jumped as the slug dug into the floor for gods sake chief terk screamed go easy i dove for the gun terk had dropped keeping low and not giving a damn whether the brain hit me or not i got into the spirit of the thing i reached the gun picked it up i wheeled on my belly firing twice the slugs never went near the brain but they scared him he let go another wild shot at me that missed by feet and then tore out of the room into the hall i could hear the front door slam luke terk was struggling to his feet on my knees i covered him with the gun he was reaching into his coat pocket cut it i snapped he must have figured that i was bluffing he kept right on into his pocket i saw his hand come out he had the pistol in it the rod he had taken from me in the entrance hall when he frisked me cut it i snapped again he raised it for a shot i yanked the trigger of his own gun it jumped in my hand it made an awful racket he fell over backwards as though i had hit him with a sledgehammer the flew up into the air and smacked a picture on the wall knocking the glass pane to bits i got to my feet and looked at him there was a hole in his right lung his chest was bleeding he was conscious his eyes were open and his lips kept moving as though he were trying to say something nothing came out hed live sawbones can fix up wounds like that one i stepped over him and started for the entrance hall at the same time the front door burst open i turned around and ran for the bedroom the gun still in my hand the window there was open i shut the window after me and started down the fire escape i knew if the police caught me there with luke terk wounded and no clare gordon to show for it i would be in a worse jam than ever i had to get the brain and the gel i went down two floors on the fire escape when i heard the window of the brains bedroom open i hugged the wall of the building and stopped moving then i heard him say no one down there and he closed the window again it was captain shane i took a breather and wondered what in hell to do i was marooned on the fire escape the only chance i had of getting off it and trailing the brain was by going through a window into an apartment and then out into the hall and down dodging cops all the way it was a small chance but the only one and it wouldnt do to have lukes gun on me glancing down into the street i saw it was pretty deserted this was the side of the hotel not the front where the cops were i heaved the gun out and away i could hear it hit just dully i tried the window in front of me it was locked swearing softly i went down another flight of the fire escape and tried the next one it was unlocked i opened it softly the shade was down it was dark green i pushed it aside and stepped into the room the lights were out it was dark as hell i stood there for a few seconds trying to adjust my eyes there wasnt a sound in the room but in the one adjoining i could hear some one walking around i started across the room a floor board creaked i stopped stiffened suddenly i gasped the bed in the room was squealing loudly as some one moved on the springs take it easy i whispered im a friend i wont hurt you i felt like a

motioning her to keep quiet when she could speak i pulled off the tape they had stuck a lemon in her mouth i took it out the first thing she said was judas priest im nearly dead shh i said i took off

mignon good eberhart turned to plotting fictional murders in order to break the boredom induced by following her husband to the civilengineering projects that took them to odd corners of the world but what this mystery writers of america grand master had added to detective fiction by the time shed published her fiftyninth novel and reached her eightyninth year had more to do with her instincts as a storyteller eberhart was born in nebraska studied at nebraska wesleyan college married a c eberhart in and again in after a divorce started her writing career with short stories and published her first novel in her first five books were in the mary roberts rinehart pattern they featured a middleaged nurse sarah keate and her young policeman friend lance oleary about the only thing new about these early books was a series character who grew younger as time passed and hollywood began filming the novels eberhart then created two amateur detectives the mystery writersleuth susan dare anticipates many imitators and the bankersleuth james wickwire is also a good example of a character who brings his professional expertise to bear on his amateur detections when eberhart decided to give up the quest for a series character sheas critics love to sayfound her own voice and blazed a new trail if we can credit rinehart with developing the had i but known form eberhart was best known for adapting the gothic dark and stormy night and elements of romance into mysterious crime she is credited with an unusual ability to make those stormy nights and particularly the places where those tempests raged highly realistic this is because as she put it a good many of these places ive lived in myself she used the places she had visited during travels with her husband to provide her exotic settings thereby anchoring her scenes with specific details that lend reality to inherently suspenseful and physically strange or threatening situations eberhart was also keen on romance she frequently featured a female protagonist and a love affairdescribed without the coyness usual for the period and also without the explicit sex that writers of her later years would be describing spider features susan dare and illustrates the authors use of devices from gothic romance to heighten tension while todays feminists might find reason enough to fault her characterisation of the female it was a long step ahead of what other writers were doing in the early s spider but it is fantastic said susan dare clutching the telephone you cant just be afraid youve got to be afraid of something she waited but there was no reply you mean she said presently in a hushed voice that im to go to this perfectly strange house to be the guest of a perfectly strange woman to you said jim byrne not i tell you to me but you said you had never seen her dont maunder said jim byrne sharply of course ive never seen her now susan do try to get this straight this woman is caroline wray one of the wrays perfectly clear said susan therefore im to go to her house and see why shes got an attack of nerves take a bag and prepare to spend the next few days as her guest im sorry jim but im busy ive got to do a murder story this week and sue said jim im serious susan paused abruptly he was serious itsi dont know how to explain it susan he said its justwell im irish you know and imfey dont laugh im not laughing said susan tell me exactly what you want me to do justwatch things there ought not to be any dangerdont see how there could be to you susan realised that she was going how many wrays are there and what do you think is going to happen there are four wrays but i dont know what is going on that has got caroline so terrified it was thatthe terror in her voicethat made me call you whats the number of the house said susan he told her its away north he said one of those old housesnarrow tall hasnt changed i suppose since old ephineas wray died he was a close friend you know of my fathers dont know why caroline called me i suppose some vague notion that a man on a newspaper would know what to do now let me seetheres caroline shes the daughter of ephineas wray david is his grandson and carolines nephew and the only manexcept the housemanin the place hes youngin his twenties i believe his father and mother died when he was a child you mean there are three women naturally theres marieshe is old wrays adopted daughternot born a wray but more like him than the rest of them and jessicashes carolines cousin but shes always lived with the wrays because her father died young people always assume that the three women are sisters actually of course they are not but old ephineas wray left his fortune divided equally among them and they all live there together yes davids not married is that said susan at the note of finality in his voice all you know about them absolutely everything not much for you to go on is it it was just said jim byrne soberly with the effect of a complete explanation that she was soso horribly scared old caroline i mean susan retraced the address slowly before she said again what was she afraid of i dont know said jim byrne andits queerbut i dont think she knew either it was approaching five oclock with a dark fog rolling up from the lake and blending itself with the early winter twilight when susan dare pressed the bell beside the wide old doorpressed it and waited lights were on in the street but the house before her was dark its windows curtained the door was heavy and secretive but they were expecting heror at least caroline wray was it had all been arranged by telephone susan wondered what caroline had told them what jim byrne had told caroline to say to explain her presence and suddenly what caroline was like little johnny hung his sister she was dead before they missed her johnnys always up to tricks aint he cute and only six the jingle had been haunting her with the persistency of a popular dance tune and it gave accent to the impatient little beat of her brown oxford upon the stone step then a light flashed on above the door susan took a deep breath of the moist cold air and felt a sudden tightening of her nerves the door was going to open it swung wider and a warm current of air struck susans cheeks beyond was a dimly lit hall and a womans figurea tall corseted figure with full sweeping skirts yes said a voice harshly out of the dimness i am susan dare said susan ohoh yes the figure moved aside and the door opened wider come in miss dare we were expecting you afterward susan remembered her own hesitation on the dark threshold as the door closed with finality behind her and the woman turned i am miss jessica wray she said jessica this was the cousin then she was a tall woman largeboned with a heavy dark face thick irongray hair done high and full on her head and long strong hands she was dressed after a much earlier fashion one which indeed susan was unable to date we were expecting you she said caroline however was obliged to go out she paused just under the light and beside a long mirror susan had a confused impression of the house in that moment an impression of old crowded elegance the mirror was wavery and framed in wide gilt there were ferns in great marble urns there were marble figures well go up to your room said jessica caroline said you would be in chicago for several days this way you can leave your bag here james will take it up later he is out just now susan put down her small suitcase and followed jessica the newel post and stair rail were heavy and carved the steps were carpeted and thickly padded and the house was utterly completely still as they ascended the quiet stairs it grew increasingly hot and airless at the top of the stairs jessica turned with a rigid motion of her strong body will you wait here a moment she said im not sure which room susan made some assenting gesture and jessica turned along the passage which ran toward the rear of the house so terrifically hot the house was so crowded with old and almost sentient furniture so very silent susan moved a bit restively it was not a pleasant house but caroline had to be afraid of somethingnot just silence and heat and brooding secretive old walls she glanced down the length of hall moved again to put her hand upon the tall newel post of the stair rail beside her the carved top of it seemed to shift and move slightly under the pressure of her hand and confirmed in the strangest way her feeling that the house itself had a singular kind of life then she was staring straight ahead of her through an open lighted doorway beyond it was a large room half bedroom and half sitting room a lamp on a table cast a circle of light and beside the table silhouetted against the light sat a woman with a book in her lap it must be marie wraythe older sister the adopted wray who was more like old ephineas wray than any of them her face was in shadow with the light beyond it so susan could see only a blunt fleshy white profile and a tight knot of shining black hair above a massive blacksilk bosom she did not apparently know of susans presence for she did not turn there was a kind of patience about that massive relaxed figure a waiting an enormous black female spider waiting in a web of shadows but waiting for what the suggestion was not one calculated to relieve the growing tension of susans nerves the heat was making her dizzy fanciful calling a harmless old woman a black spider merely because she was wearing a shiny blacksilk dress marie wray still so far as susan could see did not look at her but there was suddenly the flicker of a motion on the table susan looked and caught her breath in an incredulous little gasp there was actually a small gray creature on that table directly under the lamplight a small gray creature with a long tail it sat down nonchalantly pulled the lid off a box and dug its tiny hands into the box its a monkey thought susan with something like a clutch of hysteria its a monkeya spider monkey is itwith that tiny face it was turning its face jerkily about the room peering with bright anxious eyes here and there and busily furiously eating candy it failed somehow to see susan or perhaps she was too far away to interest it there was suddenly something curiously unreal about the scene that thought susan or the heat in this fantastic house and turned at the approaching rustle of skirts down the passage it was jessica and she looked at susan and then through the open doorway and smiled coldly marie is deaf she said i suppose she didnt realise you were here no said susan ill tell her she made a stiff gesture with her long hand and turned to enter the room beyond the open door as her gray silk rustled through the door the little monkey jerked around gave her one piercing black glance and was gone from the table in a swift gray streak he fled across the room darted under an old sofa but jessica did not reprove him marie she said loudly and distinctly there was a pause jessicas flowing graysilk skirts were now silhouetted against the table lamp and the monkey absently began to lick its paw yes jessica the voice was that of a person long deafentirely without tone susan dare is hereyou know the daughter of carolines friend do you want to see her see her no no not now later very well do you want anything no your cushions jessicas rigid back bent over marie as she arranged a cushion then she turned and walked again toward susan susan felt queerly fascinated and somehow oddly shocked to note that as jessica turned her rigid back to the room the monkey darted out from under the sofa and was suddenly skittering across the room again in the direction of the table and the candy he would be thought susan one very sick monkey the house was too hot and yet susan shivered a bit why did people keep monkeys this way said jessica firmly and susan preceded her down the hall and into exactly the kind of bedroom she might have expected it to be but jessica did not intend to leave her alone to explore its victorian fastnesses under her somewhat unnerving dark gaze susan removed her cockeyed little hat smoothed back her light hair and put her coat across a chair only to have it placed immediately by jessica in the enormous gloomy wardrobe the servants said jessica were out the second girl and james because it was their half day out the cook to do an errand you are younger than i should have expected she said abruptly to susan shall we go down now as they passed down the stairs to the drawing room a clock somewhere struck slowly with long trembling variations five said jessica caroline ought to return very soon and david he usually reaches home shortly after five that is if it isnt rainy traffic sometimes delays him but it isnt rainy tonight foggy said susan and obeyed the motion of jessicas long gray hand toward a chair it was not however a comfortable chair and neither were the moments that followed comfortable for jessica sat sternly erect in a chair opposite susan folded her hands firmly in her silk lap and said exactly nothing susan started to speak a time or two thought better of it and herself sat in rather rigid silence and was suddenly aware that she was acutely receptive to sight and sound and feeling it was not a pleasant sensation for she felt queerly as if the lives that were living themselves out in that narrow old house were pressing in upon heras if longspoken words and longstifled whispers were living yet in the heated air she stirred restively and tried not to think of marie wray queer how difficult it was once having seen marie and heard her speak not to think of that brooding figuresitting in its web of shadows waiting three old women living in an old house what were their relations to one another two of them she had seen and had heard speak and knew no more of them than she had known what about carolinethe one who was afraid she stirred again and knew jessica was watching her they heard the bell although it rang in some back part of the house jessica looked satisfied and rose its david she said at the door into the hall she added in a different tone and i suppose caroline too susan knew she was tense yet there was nothing in that house for hersusan dareto fear it was caroline who was afraid then another woman stood in the doorway caroline no doubt a tall slender woman a blonde who had faded into tremulous wispy uncertainty she did not speak her eyes were large and blue and feverish and two bright pink spots fluttered in her thin cheeks and her bare thin hands moved susan rose and went to her and took the two hands but youre so young said caroline disappointment throbbed in her voice im not really said susan and so little breathed caroline but that doesnt matter at all said susan speaking slowly as one does to a nervous child there were voices in the hall but she was mainly aware of caroline no i suppose not said caroline finally looking into susans eyes terrified jim had said curious how right jim managed to be carolines eyes sought into susans and she was about to speak when there was a rustle in the doorway carolines uncertain lips closed in a kind of gasp and jessica swept into the room but i must know what shes afraid of thought susan i must get her aloneaway from jessica take off your coat caroline said jessica dont stand there i see youve spoken to susan dare put away your hat and coat and then come down again yes jessica said caroline her hands were moving again and she looked away go on said jessica her voice was not sharp it was merely undefeatable yes jessica said caroline marie is reading said jessica you neednt speak to her now unless you wish to do so you may take susan dare in to see her later yes jessica caroline disappeared and in her place stood a man and susan was murmuring words of acknowledgment to jessicas economical introduction david too was blond and his eyes were darkly blue he was slender and fairly tall his mouth was fine and sensitive and there was a look about his temples and around his eyes that wassusan sought for the word and found itwistful he was young and strong and vibrantthe only young thing in the housebut he was not happy susan knew that at once he said how do you do miss dare dont go upstairs yet david said jessica her voice was less harsh she watched him avidly you ought to rest not now aunt jessica ill see you again miss dare he walked away aunt marie all right he called from the stairway perfectly said jessica her voice was harsh again shes reading afterward susan tried to remember whether she could actually hear davids steps upon the padded stairs or whether she was only half consciously calculating the time it took to climb the stairsthe time it took or might have taken to walk along the hall to enter a room she was sure that jessica did not speak she merely sat there why did jessica become rigid and harsh again when david spoke of marie why did a loud dreadful crash of sound forever shattered the silence in the house it fell upon susan and immersed her and shook the whole house and then receded in waves waves that left destruction and intolerable confusion susan realised dimly that she was on her feet and trying to move toward the stairway and that jessicas mouth was gray and that jessicas hands were clutching her oh my goddavid said jessica intelligibly and susan pushed the woman away from her she reached the stairway jessica beside her and at the top of the stairs two figures were locked together and struggling in the upper hall caroline screamed jessica what are you doing wheres mariewhere let me go caroline david was pulling carolines thin clutching arms from around him let me go i tell you something terrible has happened you must jessica brushed past them and then was at the door of maries room its marieshe cried harshly who shot her susan was vaguely conscious of carolines sobbing breaths and of davids shoulder pressing against her own somehow they had all got to that open doorway and were crowding there together it was marie she sat in the same chair in which shed been sitting when susan saw her so short a time ago but her head had fallen forward her whole body crumpled grotesquely into blacksilk folds jessica was the first to enter the room then david susan feeling sick and shaken followed only caroline remained in the doorway clinging to the casing with thin hands her face like chalk and her lips blue shes been shot said jessica straight through the heart then she looked at david did caroline kill her david caroline kill marie why caroline couldnt kill anything he cried then who killed her said jessica you realise dont you that shes dead her dark gaze probed deeper and she said in a grating whisper did you kill her david no cried david no shes dead said jessica susan said as crisply as she could why dont you call a doctor jessicas silk rustled and she turned to give susan a long cold look theres no need to call a doctor obviously shes dead the police then said susan softly obviously tooshes been murdered the police cried jessica scornfully turn over my own cousinmy own nephewto the police never ill call them susan said crisply and whirled and left them with their dead on the silent stairway her knees began to shake again so this was what the house had been waiting for murder and this was why caroline had been afraid what then had she known where was the revolver that had shot marie there was nothing of the kind to be seen in the room the air was hotthe house terribly stilland she susan dare was hunting for a telephonecalling a numbertalking quite sensibly on the wholeand all the time it was entirely automatic action on her part it was automatic even when she called and found jim byrne im here she said at the wrays marie has been murdered my god said jim and slammed up the receiver the house was so hot susan sat down weakly on the bottom step and huddled against the newel post and felt extremely ill if she were really a detective of course she would go straight upstairs and wring admissions out of them while they were shaken and confused and before theyd had time to arrange their several defences but she wasnt a detective and she had no wish to be and all she wanted just then was to escape something moved in the shadows under the stairsmoved susan flung her hands to her throat to choke back a scream and the little monkey whirled out peered at her worriedly then darted up the window curtain and sat nonchalantly on the heavy wooden rod her coat and hat were upstairs she couldnt go out into the cold and fog without themand jim byrne was on the way if she could hold out till he got there david was coming down the stairs she says its all right to call the police he said in a tight voice ive called them he looked down at her and suddenly sat on the bottom step beside her its been hell he said quite simply but i didnt think ofmurder he stared at nothing and susan could not bear the look of horror on his young face i understand she said wishing she did understand i didnt he said untiljust lately i knewoh since i was a child ive known i must must what said susan gravely he flushed quickly and was white again oh its a beastly thing to say i was the onlychild you know and i grew up knowing that i dared have nono favouriteyou see if thered been more of usor if the aunts had married and had their own childrenbut i didnt understand howhow violent the word stopped in his throat and he coughed and went onhow strongly they felt who why aunt jessica of course and aunt marie and aunt caroline too many aunts said susan dryly what was it they were violent about the house and each other andand other things oh ive always known but it was allhidden you know the surface wasall right susan groped through the fog the surface was all right hed said but the fog parted for a rather sickening instant and gave her an ugly glimpse of an abyss below why was caroline afraid said susan carolinehe said staring at her afraidhis blue eyes were brilliant with anxiety and excitement see here he said if you think it was caroline who killed marie it wasnt she couldnt shed never have dared i mmean he was stammering in his excitementi mean caroline wouldnt hurt a fly and caroline wouldnt have opposed marie about anything marieyou dont know what marie was like exactly what happened in the upstairs hall you meanwhen the shot yes why ii was in my roomno not quitei was nearly at the door and i heard the shot and its queer but i believei believe i knew right away that it was a revolver shot it was as if i had expected he checked himself but i hadnt expectedi he stopped dug his fists desperately into his pockets and was suddenly firm and controlledbut i hadnt actually expected it you understand then when you heard the shot you turned i suppose and looked yes yes i think so anyway there was caroline in the hall too i think she was screaming we were both running i thought of mariei dont know why but caroline clutched at me and held me she didnt want me to go into maries room she was terrified and then i think you were there and jessica were you yes and there was no one else in the hall no one came from maries room his face was perplexed terribly puzzled nobody exceptcaroline but i tell you it couldnt have been caroline the doorbell began to ringshrill sharp peals that stabbed the shadows and the thickness of the house its the police thought susan catching her breath sharply the boy beside her had straightened and was staring at the wide old door that must be opened behind them on the padded stairway something rustled its the police said jessica harshly let them in susan had not realised that there would be so many of them or that they would do so much or that an inquiry could last so long she had not realised either how amazingly thorough they were with their photographs and their fingerprinting and their practiced and rapid and incredibly searching investigation she was a little shocked and more than a little awed sheerly from witnessing at first hand and with her own eyes what police actually did when there was murder yet her own interview with lieutenant mohrrv was not difficult he was brisk youthful kind and jim byrne was there to explain her presence she had been very thankful to see jim byrne who arrived on the heels of the police tell the police everything you know he had said but i dont know anything and it was lieutenant mohrn who oddly enough brought susan into the very centre and hub of the whole affair but that was latermuch later after endless inquiry endless search endless repetitions endless conferences endless waiting in the gloomy dining room with portraits of dead and vanished wrays staring fixedly down upon policemen upon susan upon servants whose alibis had jim had informed her been immediately and completely established it was close to one oclock when jim came to her again see here he said you look like a ghost have you had anything to eat no said susan a moment later she was in the kitchen accepting provender that jim byrne brought from the icebox you do manage to get things done she said i thought newspapermen wouldnt even be permitted in the house oh the police are all righttheyll give a statement to all of ustreat us right you know more cake and dont forget im in on this case have you found out yet what caroline was afraid of no ive not had a chance to talk to her jim who did it he smiled mirthlessly youre asking me theyve established mainly three things the servants are clear there was no one in the house besides jessica and david and caroline and me said susan with a small shudder andmarie and you agreed jim imperturbably and marie third they cant find the gun jessica and you alibi each other that leaves david and caroline wellwhich of them did it and why i dont know she said but jim im frightened frightened with the house full of police why i dont know said susan again its nothing i can explain its justa queer kind of menace somewheresomehowin this house its like marieonly marie is dead and this is alive horribly alive susan knew she was incoherent and that jim was staring at her worriedly and suddenly the swinging door behind her opened and susans heart leaped to her throat before the policeman spoke the lieutenant wants you both please he said as they passed through the hall the clock struck a single note that vibrated long afterward it had been then eight hours and more since she had entered that wide door and been met by jessica lights were on everywhere now and there were policemen and the oldfashioned sliding doors between the hall and the drawing room had been closed and they shut in the sound of voices in there said the policeman and drew back one of the doors it was entirely silent in the heavily furnished room lights were on in the chandelier above and it was eerily dreadfully bright the streaks showed in the faded brownvelvet curtains at the windows and the wavery lines in the mantelpiece mirror and the worn spots in the old turkish rug and every gray shadow on jessicas face was darker and the fine sharp lines around carolines mouth and her haunted eyes showed terribly clear and there were two brightscarlet spots in davids cheeks lieutenant mohrn had lost his look of youth and freshness and looked the weary graying forty that he was a detective in plain clothes was sitting on the small of his back in one of the slippery plush chairs the door slid together again behind them and still no one spoke although jessica turned to look at them and oddly susan had a feeling that everything in that household had changed yet jessica had not actually changed her eyes met susans with exactly the same cold remote command then what was it that was different carolinesusans eyes went to the thin bent figure hunched tragically on the edge of her chair her fine hair was in wisps about her face her mouth tremulous why of course it was not a change it was merely that both jessica and caroline had become somehow intensified they were both etched more sharply the shadows were deeper the lines blacker lieutenant mohrn turned to caroline this is the young woman you refer to isnt it miss caroline carolines eyes fluttered to susan avoided jessica and returned fascinated to lieutenant mohrn yesyes david whirled from the window and crossed to stand directly above caroline look here aunt caroline you realise that whatever you tell miss dare shell be bound to tell the police its just the same thingyou know that dont you oh yes david thats whathesaid lieutenant mohrn cleared his throat abruptly and a bit uncomfortably she understands that wray i dont know why she wont tell me but she wont and she says she will talk to miss dare caroline said jessica is a fool she moved rigidly to look at caroline who refused to meet her eyes and said youll find carolines got nothing to tell carolines eyes went wildly to the floor to the curtains to david and both her hands fluttered to her trembling mouth id rather talk to her she said caroline said jessica you are behaving irrationally you have been like this for days you brought thisthis susan dare into the house you lied to me about hertold me it was a daughter of a school friend i might have known you had no such intimate friend she shot a dark look at susan and swept back to caroline now youve told the police that you were afraid and that you telephoned to a perfect stranger jim byrne fluttered caroline his father and my father that means nothing said jessica harshly dont interrupt me and then this young woman comes into our house why answer me caroline why iwas afraid of what ii caroline stood motioning frantically with her handsill tell ill tell miss dare shell know what to do this is the situation miss dare said lieutenant mohrn patiently miss caroline has admitted that she was alarmed about something and why you are here she has also admitted that there was an urgent and pressing problem that was causing dissension in the household but shesvery tired as you seea little nervous perhaps and she says she is willing to tell but that she prefers talking to you he smiled wearily at any rateits asking a great deal of you but will you hear what she has to tell itsa whim of course there was something friendly and kind in the look he gave caroline but well humour her and she understands i understand said caroline with a flash of decision but i dont wantanyone but susan dare nonsense caroline said jessica i have a right to hear so has david carolines eyes glancing this way and that to avoid jessica actually met jessicas gaze and she succumbed at once yes jessica she said obediently all right then now we are going outside miss caroline you can say anything you want to say and remember we are here only to help lieutenant mohrn paused at the sliding door and susan saw a look flash between him and jim byrne she also saw jim byrnes hand go to his pocket and the brief little nod he gave the lieutenant do you mind if i stay in the room but out of earshot miss jessica jim asked no jessica agreed grudgingly well be just outside said lieutenant mohrn speaking to jim something in his voice added ready for any kind of trouble she saw too the look in jims eyes as he glanced at her and then back to the lieutenant and all at once she understood the meaning of that look and the meaning of his gesture toward his pocket he had a revolver there then and the lieutenant was promising protection but that meant that they were going to leave her alone with the wrays alone with three people one of whom was a murderer but she was not entirely alone jim byrne was there in the far corner his eyes wary and alert and his smile unperturbed very well now caroline said jessica lets hear your precious story its about the house began caroline looking at susan as if she dared not permit her glance to swerve the police dragged it out of me jessica laughed harshly and interrupted so thats your important evidence i can tell it with less foolishness it is simply that we have had an offer of a considerable sum of money for the purchase of this house we happen to hold this houseall four of uswith equal interest thus it is necessary for us to agree before we can sell or otherwise dispose of the property thats really all there is to it caroline and david wanted to sell i didnt care but marie didnt want to sell cried caroline and marie was stronger than any of us miss caroline said susan softly why were you afraid for a dreadful second or two there was utter silence then as dreadfully caroline collapsed into her chair again and put her hands over her mouth and moaned but jessica was ready to speak she had nothing to be afraid of shes merely nervousvery nervous i know caroline what you have been doing with every cent of money you could get your silly hands upon but i intended to do nothing about it caroline had given up her effort to avoid jessica she was staring at her like a terrified panting bird youknow she gasped in a thin high voice of course i know you are completely transparent caroline i know that you were gambling away your inheritanceor at least what you could touch gambling cried david what do you mean stocks said jessica harshly speculative stocks it got her like a fever caroline has always been susceptible so you have no money at all left caroline is that why you were so anxious to sell the house you surely havent been fool enough to buy on margin carolines distraught hands confessed what her trembling lips could not speak david was suddenly standing beside her his hand on her thin shoulder dont worry aunt carrie he said itll be all right youve got enough in trust to take care of you over carolines head he looked at jessica the look or the tenderness in his voice when he spoke to caroline seemed to infuriate jessica and she arose amid a rustling of silk and stood there tall and rigid facing him why dont you offer to take care of her yourself david she said gratingly david was white and his eyes brilliant with pain but he replied steadily you know why aunt jessica and you know why she gambled too we were both trying to make enough money to get away to get away from this house to get away from he stopped from what david said jessica from marie said david desperately and from you jessica did not move her face did not change there was only a queer luminous flash in her eyes after a horribly long moment she said i loved you far better than marie loved you david you feared her i intended to give you money when you came to me you had to come to me you would have begged me for helpme jessica why did you or caroline kill marie was it because she refused to sell the house i know why she refused she pretended that it was sentiment that she the adopted daughter was more a wray than any of us but it wasnt that really she hated us and we wanted to sell that is you and caroline wanted to sell for your own selfish interests iit made no difference to me caroline sobbed and cried jerkily but you did care jessica you wanted the money youyou love money there was a strangely incredulous wail in her thin voice moneymoney not the things it will buy not the freedom it might give you but moneybonds mortgages gold you love money first jessica and you carolinesaid jessica in a terrible voice caroline babbled and sobbed into silence caroline you are not responsible you forget that there are strangers here that marie has been murdered try to collect yourself at once you are making a disgusting exhibition all three looked at susan and as suddenly as they had been diverted from each other they were for a moment united in their feeling against susan she was the intruder the instrument of the police placed there by the law for the purpose of discovering evidence their eyes were not pleasant susan smoothed back her hair and she was acutely aware of the small telegram of warning that ran along her nerves one of them had murdered she turned to caroline then were you afraid that marie would discover what you had been doing with your money she asked gently caroline blinked and was immediately ready to reply her momentary feeling against susan disseminated by the small touch of kindness in susans manner no she said in a confidential way that wasnt what i was afraid of then was there something unusual about the house something that troubled you oh yes yes said caroline what was it asked susan scarcely daring to breathe if only jessica would remain silent for another moment but caroline was fluttering again i dont know i dont know you see it was all so queer marie holding out against us all and we allexcept jessica sometimesobeyed marie weve always obeyed marie everything in the house has done that even spiderthethe monkey you know susan permitted her eyes to flicker toward jessica she stood immovable watching david susan could not interpret that dark look and she did not try instead she leaned over to caroline took her fluttering ineffectual hands and said still gently tell me exactly why you telephoned to jim byrne what was it that happened in the morningor maybe the night beforethat made you afraid how did you know said caroline it happened that night what was it said susan so softly that it was scarcely more than a whisper but caroline quite suddenly swerved i wasnt afraid of marie she said but everyone obeyed marie even the house always seemed more maries house thanthan jessicas but i didnt kill marie tell me repeated susan what happened last night that wasqueer caroline said jessica harshly dragging herself back from some deep brooding gulf youve said enough susan ignored her and held carolines feverishly bright eyes with her own tell me it wasmarie gasped caroline mariewhat did she do said susan she didnt do anything said caroline it was what she said no it wasnt that exactly it was if you insist upon talking caroline you might at least try to be intelligible said jessica coldly could she get jessica out of the room thought susan probably not and it was all too obvious that she was standing by permitting caroline to talk only so long as caroline said nothing that she jessica did not want her to say susan said quietly did you hear marie speak yes that was just it cried caroline eagerly and it was so very queer that is of course wethat is ihave often thought that marie must be about the house much more than she pretended to be in order to know all the things she knew that is she always knew everything that happened in the house itsometimes it was queer you know because it was likelike magic or something it was quite said caroline with an unexpected burst of imagery as if she had one of those astralbody things and it walked all around the house while marie just sat there in her room astralbodythings said jessica deliberately caroline crimsoned and jessicas hands gestured outward as much as to say you see for yourself what a state shes in the old room was silent again susans heart was pounding and again those small tocsins of warning were sounding in some subconscious realm all those forces were silently invisibly combatingstruggling against each other and somewhere amid them was the truthquite tangiblealtogether real but the astral body said caroline suddenly into the silence couldnt have talked and i heard marie speak she was in jessicas room and the door was closed and i heard her talking to jessica and thenthats whats queeri went straight on past the door and into maries room and there was marie sitting there isnt it queer why were you frightened becausebecause carolines hands twisted together i dont know why except that i had aa feeling nonsense jessica laughed there was again the luminous flash in her shadowed eyes and she spoke more rapidly than usual you see susan dare how nonsensical all this is how utterly fantastic there was marie said caroline she was talking to you jessicas silks rustled and she walked rigidly and quickly to caroline and leaned over so that she could grip carolines shoulder and force caroline to meet her eyes david tried to intervene and she brushed him away and said hoarsely caroline you poor little fool you thought youd get this young woman here and try to establish your innocence of the crime all this talk is sheer nonsense you are cunning after the way of fools such as you tell me this caroline she paused long enough to take a great gasp of breath she was more powerful more invincible than susan had seen her tell me where was david when the revolver was fired caroline was shrinking backward david said quickly shell say anything to protect me shell say anything and you be quiet david caroline answer me he was at the door of his room said caroline for a long moment jessica waited then with terrible deliberation she relaxed her grip and straightened and looked slowly from one to the other youve as good as confessed carrie she said there was no one else you admit that it was not david why did you kill her carrie she didnt kill her david was between the two women his face white and his eyes blazing it was you jessica you david stop the two sharp exclamations were like lashes i was here in this room when the shot was fired i didnt kill marie i couldnt have killed her you know that come caroline she put her gray hand upon carolines shoulder caroline as if mesmerized by that touch arose and jessica turned to the doorway no one moved as the two women crossed the room jim byrne glanced at susan unrevealingly and then at jessicas imperious gesture opened the door susan was vaguely aware that there were men in the hall outside but she was held as if enchanted by the extraordinary scene she was witnessing no one moved and there was no sound save the rustle of jessicas silks while she led caroline to the stairway at the bottom step jessica turned and there was suddenly something less harsh in her face it was for an instant almost kind and there was a queer sort of tenderness in the pressure of her hand upon carolines shrinking shoulder but that hand was nevertheless compelling go upstairs she said to caroline in a voice loud enough so that they all heard go upstairs and do what is necessary theres enough veronal on my dresser well give you time she turned as if to barricade the stairway with her own rigid body and looked slowly and defiantly around her ill make them give you time carrie go on there was the complete and utter silence of sheer horror and in that silence something small and gray and quick flashed down from the curtain and up the stairs holy mother cried someone what was that and david sprang forward you cant do thatyou cant do that caroline dont move susan knew that he was thrusting himself between jessica and caroline that there was sudden confusion but she was mainly aware of something that had clicked in her own mind somehow she got through the confusion in the hall to lieutenant mohrn and jim byrne was at her side both of them listened to the brief words she said lieutenant mohrn ran rapidly upstairs and jim disappeared toward the dining room jim was back first he pulled susan to one side you are right he said the cook and the houseman both say that marie was very strict about the monkey and that the monkey always obeyed her but what do you mean im not sure jim but ive just told lieutenant mohrn that i think there should be a bullet hole somewhere upstairs it was made by the second bullet it is in the ceiling perhapsor wall i think its in jessica s room lieutenant mohrn was coming down the stairway he reached the bottom of the stairs and looked wearily and a bit sadly at the group there at caroline crumpled against the wall at david white and taut at jessica a rigid figure of hatred then he sighed and looked at the policeman nearest him and nodded will you go into the drawing room please he asked susan and you jim the doors slid together and still wearily lieutenant mohrn pulled out from his pocket a revolver a long cord a piece of cotton and a small alarm clock they were all there hidden in the newel post at the top of the stairway the carved top was loose as you remembered it miss dare and theres two shots gone from the revolver and theres a bullet hole in the wall of jessicas bedroom how did you know it was jessica miss dare it was the monkey said susan her voice sounded unnatural in her own ears terribly tired terribly sad it was the monkey all the time you see he was sitting there stealing candy right beside maries chair he would have been afraid to do that if he had not known she was dead and when jessica entered the room he fled when i thought of that the whole thing fell together the hot house obviously to keep maries body warm and confuse the time of death everyone out of the house to permit jessica to do murder then this thing youve found its simple of course said lieutenant mohrn the cord fastened tight between the alarm lever and the triggerthe bit of cotton to pad the alarm the clock is set for ten minutes after five when did she hide it in the newel post when i went down to telephone the police i suppose and david and caroline were in maries roomi want to go home said susan wearily look here said jim byrne this sounds all right susan but remember marie couldnt have been dead then you heard her talk i had never heard her speak before and i heard the flat dead tone of a person who has been deaf a long time it was caroline who actually solved the thing and jessica knew it she knew it and at once tried to fasten the blame upon carolineto compel her to commit suicide what did caroline say lieutenant mohrn was very patient she said that shed heard marie speaking with jessica in jessicas room behind a closed door and that shed gone straight on past that door to maries room and found marie sitting there caroline was confused frightened talked of astral bodies naturally we knew that jessica wasrehearsing her imitation of maries way of speaking premeditated said jim planned to the last detail and your coming merely gave her the opportunity you were to provide the alibi susan susan shivered that was the trouble she was sitting directly opposite me when the shot was fired upstairs yet she was the only person who hated marie sufficiently tomurder her it wasnt money it was hatred growing for years in this horrible house nourished by jealousy over david brought to a climax that was inevitable susan smoothed her hair please may i go then marie was dead when you entered the house yes propped up by pillows ii saw the whole thing you know saw jessica approach her and talk heard the replyand how was i to know it was jessica speaking and not marie then jessica bent and did something to her cushions pulled them away i suppose so the body was no longer erect and she turned at once and was between me and marie all the way to the door so i could not see marie then at all i couldnt see marie very well at any time because she was in the shadow and when david and caroline came upstairs jessica warned both of them that marie was reading i suppose she knew that they were only too glad to be relieved of the necessity to speak to marie susan shivered again and smoothed back her hair and felt dreadfully that she might cry its a t terrible house she said indecisively and jim byrne said hurriedly she can go now cant she ive got a car out here she doesnt have to see them again the air was cold and fresh and the sky very black before dawn and the pavements glistened they swerved onto the drive and stopped for a red light and jim turned to her as they waited through the dusk in the car she could feel his scrutiny i didnt expect anything like this he said gravely will you forgive me next time said susan in a small clear voice ill not get scared next time said jim derisively there wont be a next time i was the one that was scared i had my finger on the trigger of a revolver all the time you were talking to them no indeedy there wont be a next timenot if i can help it erle stanleygardner although erie stanley gardner didnt turn to writing until he reached the relatively ripe age of thirtyfour when he died at age eightyone on his california ranch of his books were in print and more were awaiting publication by a staggering million copies of his books had been sold in thirtyseven languages making him one of the most popular writers of fiction ever the mystery writers of america made it official by declaring him a grand master in gardner was born in maiden massachusetts the son of an engineer whose work moved him to oregon and then californiaa state that the boy loved and the man used as the base of his fiction as a youth he boxed professionally and promoted boxing bouts and reputedly was expelled from college for slugging a professor he educated himself by reading law books and helping an attorney passed the bar exam at twentyone and established a reputation as a canny defence attorney he learned the writing trade in the same wayreading and studying the work of others in the field gardner had been writing prolifically for ten years before he published the first of the perry mason series his huge output for the pulps introduced numerous characters including speed dash a detective who can scale the sides of buildings in the event that a door is locked and the armchair detective lester leith whose specialty is solving jewel thefts by means of reading newspaper accounts mason is introduced in the case of the velvet claws in this novel mason deduces that dampness around an umbrella stand means that a witness was at the murder scene when he said he was he thereby saves an obnoxious character and makes the point that justice and law are more important than personal considerations gardner s knowledge of and respect for criminal law form a thread that runs through all the mason books gardner created other series characters with legal connections middleaged sleuth bertha cool teams up with donald lam a disbarred attorney whose legal advice helps to solve cases gardner used district attorney doug selby to illustrate his appreciation of the prosecutions outlook on crime leg man also features a character from the world of law the story is unusual in that it puts the legal assistant at centre stage as protagonist it is typical of gardner s work in its use of canny tricks and an eye for detail to solve the mystery leg man mae devers came into my office with the mail she stood by my chair for a moment putting envelopes on the desk pausing to make little adjustments of the inkwell and paper weights tidying things up a bit there was a patentleather belt around her waist and below that belt i could see the play of muscles as her supple figure moved from side to side i slid my arm around the belt and started to draw her close to me dont get fresh she said trying to pull my hand away but not trying too hard listen i have work to do she said let me loose pete holding you for ransom smileeyes i told her she suddenly bent down her lips formed a hot circle against mineand cedric l boniface had to choose that moment to come busting into my office without knocking mae heard the preliminary rattle of the doorknob and scooped up a bunch of papers from the desk i ran fingers through my hair and boniface cleared his throat in his best professional manner i couldnt be certain whether i had any lipstick on my mouth so i put my elbow on my desk covered my mouth with the fingers of my hand and stared intently at an open law book mae devers said very well mr wennick ill see that it gets in the mail and started for the door as she passed boniface she turned and gave me a roguish glance as much as to say now smartie see what youve got yourself into boniface stared at me hard his yellowish eyes with the bluishwhite eyeballs reminded me of hardboiled eggs which had been peeled and cut in two lengthwise he was in a vile humour what was all the commotion about he asked commotion i inquired raising my eyes but keeping my hand to my mouth where in here he said mae devers was just closing the door did you hear anything miss devers i asked in my most dignified manner no sir she said demurely and slipped out into the corridor i frowned down at the open law book on the desk i cant seem to make any sense out of the distinction between a bailment of the first class and a bailment of the second class that mollified boniface somewhat he loved to discourse on the academic legal points which no one else ever gave a damn about the distinction he said is relatively simple if you can keep from becoming confused by the terminology primarily the matter of consideration is the determining factor in the classification of all bailments yes sir i said my voice muffled behind my hand boniface stared at me wennick he said theres something queer about your connection with this firm youre supposed to be studying law youre supposed to make investigations youre a cross between a sublimated law clerk and a detective it just happens however that in checking over our income tax i find that the emoluments which have been paid you during the past three months would fix your salary at something over fifteen thousand dollars a year there was nothing i could say to that so i kept quiet mae devers opened the door and said mr jonathan wants to see you at once mr wennick i got out of the chair as though it had been filled with tacks and said im coming at once excuse me mr boniface mae devers stood in the doorway which led to the general offices and laughed at me as i jerked out a handkerchief and wiped lipstick from my mouth that she told me is what you get for playing around i didnt have time to say anything when old e b jonathan sent word that he wanted to see me at once it meant that he wanted to see me at once cedric l boniface followed me to the door of my office and stared meditatively down the corridor as though debating with himself whether or not to invade the sanctity of e bs office to pursue the subject further i popped into e bs private office like a rabbit making its burrow two jumps ahead of a fox old e b looked worse than ever this morning his face was the colour of skimmed milk there were pouches underneath his tired eyes as big as my fist his face was puckered up into the acrimonious expression of one who has just bit into a sour lemon lock the door wennick he said i locked the door take a seat i sat down wennick he said were in a devil of a mess i sat there waiting for him to go on there was some question over certain deductions in my income tax statement he said without thinking i told mr boniface to brief the point that made it necessary for him to consult the income tax return and he saw how much youd been paid for the last three months so he was just telling me i said well e b said its embarrassing i need boniface in this business he can spout more academic law than a college professor and hes so damn dumb he doesnt know that im using him for a stuffed shirt no one would ever suspect him of being implicated in theer more spectacular methods which you use to clean up the cases on which hes working yes i conceded the mans a veritable talking encyclopaedia of law e b said well have to handle it some way if he asks you any questions tell him its a matter youd prefer to have him discuss with me wennick is that lipstick on the corner of your mouth mechanically i jerked a handkerchief out of my pocket to the corner of my mouth no sir i said just a bit of red crayon i was using to mark up that brief and i stopped as i saw e bs eyes on the handkerchief it was a red smear there was no use lying to the old buzzard now i stuck the handkerchief back in my pocket and said hell yes its lipstick miss devers i presume he said dryly i didnt say anything im afraid he said its going to be necessary to dispense with her services at the time i hired her i thought she was just a bit tooer voluptuous however she was so highly recommended by the employment agency that its all right i said go ahead and fire her you wont mind certainly not i told him i can get a job some other place and get one for her at the same time now wait a minute wennick he said dont misunderstand me im very well satisfied with your services if you could only learn to leave women alone i decided i might as well give him both barrels listen i said you think women are poison i think theyre damned interesting the only reason im not going to ask you whether the rumour is true that youre paying simultaneous alimony to two wives is that i dont think i have any business inquiring into your private life and the only reason im not going to sit here and talk about my love life is that i know damned well you havent any business prying into mine his long bony fingers twisted restlessly one over the other as he wrapped his fists together then he started cracking his knuckles one at a time wennick he said at length i have great hopes for your future i hate to see you throw yourself away on the fleeting urge of a biological whim all right i told him i wont he finished his tenknuckle salute and shook his head lugubriously theyll get you in the long run wennick he said im not interested in long runs i told him i like the sprints he sighed unlaced his fingers and got down to business the reason im particularly concerned about this wennick is that the case im going to send you out on involves a woman a very attractive woman unless im sadly mistaken she is a very vital woman very much alive veryer amorous who is she i asked her name is pemberton mrs olive pemberton her husbands harvey c pemberton of the firm of bass pemberton brokers in culverton what does she want i asked her husbands being taken for a ride what sort of a ride he let his cold eyes regard me in a solemn warning a joy ride pete whos the woman old e b consulted a memo her name is diane lockeand shes redheaded what do i do you find some way to spike her guns apparently she has an ironclad case against pemberton ill start boniface working on it hell puzzle out some legal technicality on which hell hang a defence but you beat him to it by spiking her guns has the redhead filed suit i asked not yet e b said at present its in the milkandhoney stage shes getting ready to tighten the screws and mrs pemberton has employed us to see that this other woman doesnt drain her husbands pocketbook with this threatened suit incidentally youre to stay at the pemberton house and remember mr pemberton doesnt know his wife is wise to all this and is trying to stop it just how i asked do i account for my presence to mr harvey c pemberton youre to be mrs pembertons brother how do you figure that mrs pemberton has a brother living in the west her husband has never seen him fortunately his name also is peter so you wont have any difficulty over names suppose i asked the real brother shows up while im there at the house he wont e b said all you have to do is to go to the door at seventhirty this evening shell be waiting for your ring shell come to the door and put on all the act thats necessary youll wear a red carnation in your left coat lapel so therell be no mistake her maiden name by the way was crowe youll be peter crow sort of a wandering neerdowell brother the husband knows all about you by reputation and hasnt seen any pictures or anything i asked apparently not e b said it sounds like a plant to me i told him dubiously im quite certain its all right he said i have collected a substantial retainer o k i told him im on my way pete he called as i placed my hand on the door what is it youll be discreet he warned i turned to give him a parting shot i certainly hope ill be able to i said but i doubt it and pulled the door shut behind me i looked at my wrist watch saw i had three minutes to go and put the red carnation in the left lapel of my coat id already spotted the house it was a big rambling affair which oozed an atmosphere of suburban prosperity i took it that bass pemberton brokers had an income which ran into the upper brackets i jerked down my vest adjusted the knot in my tie smoothed the point of my collar and marched up the front steps promptly at seventhirty i jabbed the bell i heard slow dignified masculine steps in the corridor that wasnt what e b had led me to expect i wondered for a moment if thered been a hitch in plans and i was going to have to face the husband the door opened i took one look at the sour puss on the guy standing in the doorway and knew he was the butler he was looking at me as a judge looks at a murderer when i heard a feminine squeal and caught a flying glimpse of a woman with jetblack hair dusky olive complexion and a figure that would get by anywhere she gave a squeal of delight and flung her arms around my neck pete she screamed oh pete you darling you dear i knew youd look me up if you ever came near here the butler stepped back and coughed the woman hugged me jumped up and down in an ecstasy of glee then said let me look at you she stepped back her hands on my shoulders her eyes studying me up to that point it had been rehearsed but the rest of it wasnt i saw approval in her eyes a certain trumpthisace expression and she tilted her head to offer me her lips i dont know just what e b referred to as being discreet i heard the butler cough more violently i guess he didnt know she had a brother i let her lead she led with an ace i came up for air to see a shortcoupled chap with a tight vest regarding me from brown mildly surprised eyes back of him was a tall guy fifteen years older with fringes of what had once been red hair around his ears the rest of his dome was bald he had a horse face and the march of time had done things to it it was a face which showed character mrs pemberton said pete youve never met my husband the chunky chap stepped forward and i shoved out my hand well well well i said so this is harvey how are you harvey and mr bass my husbands partner she said i shook hands with the tall guy pete crowe my rollingstone brother mrs pemberton observed wheres your baggage pete i left it down at the station i told her she laughed nervously and said its just like you to come without sending a wire well drive down and pick up your baggage got room for me i asked have we she exclaimed ive just been dying to see you harvey is so busy with his mergers and his horrid old business that i dont ever get a chance to see him any more youre a godsend harvey put his arm around his wifes waist there there little girl he said it wont be much longer and then well take a vacation we can go for a cruise somewhere how about the south seas is that a promise she asked thats a promise he told her so solemnly i felt certain he was lying youve made promises before she pouted but something new always came up in the business well it wont come up this time ill even sell the business before i get in another spell of work like this i caught him glancing significantly at his partner weve just finished dinner mrs pemberton explained to me and mr bass and my husband are going back to their stuffy old office how about going down and picking up your baggage now anything you say i told her leaving it up to her to take the lead come on then she invited harvey s car is out front mines in the garage well go get it out oh you darling im so glad to see you and she went into another clinch harvey pemberton regarded me with a patronising smile olives told me a lot about you pete he said im looking forward to a chance to talk with you bass took a cigar from his pocket is pete the one who did all the big game hunting down in mexico he asked thats the one mrs pemberton told him bass said you and i must have a good long chat some time young man i used to be a forest ranger when i was just out of school i was located up in the upper sespe and the pine mountain country i suppose you know the section ive hunted all over it i said he nodded i was ranger there for three years well come on harvey lets go down and go over those figures we go out the back way olive pemberton told me grabbing my hand and hurrying me out a side door she skipped on ahead toward the garage hurry she said they have a conference on at their office and i want to hear what its about she jerked open the garage door i helped her into the car and she smiled her thanks as she adjusted herself in the seat i like my feet free when im driving she said pulling her skirt up to her knees she had pretty legs i climbed in beside her and she started the motor we went out of there like a fire wagon charging down the main stem of a hick town her husband and bass were just getting into their car as we hit the incline to the street the car flattened down on its springs then shot up in the air i hung on i heard rubber scream as she spun the wheel waved her hand to her husband and went streaking down the street you always drive like that i asked most of the time she said sometimes i go faster no wonder you want your feet free i told her she glanced down at her legs then her eyes were back on the road i want to beat them there she explained ive bribed the janitor and i have an office next to theirs she stepped harder on the gas angrily hope i didnt scare you with my greeting she said with a sidelong glance i had to act cordial you know i like cordiality i told her it becomes you she gave attention to her driving it was the sort of driving which needed lots of attention she reached the business section of town hogged the traffic crowded the signals at the intersections and whipped the car into a parking lot she said come on pete and led the way toward a sevenstory building which apparently was the towns best in the way of office buildings its fortunate your names really pete she commented as we entered the building i nodded and let it go at that i was sizing her up out of the corner of my eye she was one of these supple women who seem to be just about half panther she must have been around thirtytwo or three but her figure and walk were what youd expect to find on a woman in the early twenties there was a peculiar husky note to her voice and her eyes were just a little bit more than provocative the night elevators were on the janitor came up in response to her ring his face lit up like a christmas tree when he saw her he looked over at me and looked dubious its all right olaf she said this mans helping me hurry up because my husbands coming we got in the cage olaf slammed the door and sent us rattling upward his eyes feasting on olives profile ive seen dogs look at people with exactly that same expressioninarticulate love and a dumb blind loyalty he let us out at the sixth floor this way she said and walked on ahead of me down the corridor i noticed the swing of her hips as she walked i think she wanted me tonot that she gave a particular damn about me she was simply one of those women who like to tease the animalsor was she making a play for me no chance of the janitor selling you out i asked as she fitted a key in the lock no she said you seem to have a lot of faith in human nature i told her as she clicked back the lock and snapped on lights in the office i have she told me in masculine nature men always play fair with me its women who doublecross me i hate women the office was bare of furnishings save for a battered stenographers desk a couple of straightback chairs an ashtray and waste basket wires ran down from a hole in the plaster to terminate in an electrical gadget she opened a drawer in the desk took out two head pieces and handed me one when you hear my husband come in the next office she said plug that in and remember what you hear i think things are coming to a showdown tonight i sat across from her and nursed the last of my cigarette anything in particular im supposed to do about it i asked of course she said what i asked thats up to you want me to bust things up with a club i asked she studied me with her dark seductive eyes i may as well be frank with you she said in that rich throaty voice i dont care a thing in the world about my husband i dont think he cares any more about me a separation is inevitable when it happens i want my share of the property whats the property i asked her mostly a partnership interest she said hes a free spender and hes been stepping around high wide and handsome after a man gets to be fortythree and starts stepping around it takes money so far hes been just a mild sugar daddy i havent cared particularly just so there was plenty for me to spend but now hes put his neck in a noose this diane locke is shrewd shes too damn shrewd or maybe somebody with brains is back of her i think it must be a lawyer somewhere anyway they have harvey over a barrel he needs money lots of money the only way he can get it is to sell his partnership interest you heard that crack he made about selling out so he could take me on a cruise i nodded well she said if thats whats in the wind im going to throw a lot of monkey wrenches in that machinery i did a little thinking the redhead i said might open her bag take out a nice pearlhandled gun and go ratatattat they have been known to do that you know it was just a feeler i wanted to see what shed say she said it thats all right too theres a big life insurance policy in my favour but what i dont want is to have him stripped hehere they come now i heard the elevator door clang there were steps in the corridor then i heard keys rattling and the door in the adjoining office creaked back and i heard the click of the light switch mrs pemberton nodded to me and i plugged in the jack and put the ear pieces over my head she snapped a switch and i could hear faint humming noises in the ear pieces then i heard a voice that i recognised as bass saying but harvey why the devil do you want to sell out i want to play a little bit harvey pemberton said i want to have a real honeymoon with my wife before im too old to enjoy it weve never travelled i married her four years ago when we were putting through that big hotel deal and ive had my nose pushed against the grindstone ever since we never had a honeymoon what are you going to do after you get back i dont know you could arrange things so you could take a honeymoon without selling out bass said i hate to lose you as a partner harvey no i wouldnt leave a business behind in which i had all my money tied up pemberton said id worry about it so id be a rotten companion i want to step out footloose and fancyfree one of the reasons i dont want you to do it right now bass said is that im rather short of money myself i couldnt offer you anywhere near what your interest in the business is worth what could you offer pemberton said an edge to his voice i dont know i heard bass say oh come pemberton told him impatiently you cant pull that stuff with me arthur i told you this afternoon that i wanted to figure on some sort of a deal youve had all afternoon to think it over there was silence for several seconds and i gathered that bass was perhaps making figures on paper i heard harvey pemberton say im going to have an accountant work up a statement showing the status of the business and that doesnt have anything to do with it bass said its not a question of what the business is worth its a question of what i can afford to pay without jeopardizing my working capital ill tell you frankly harvey that i dont want you to sell i dont want to lose you as a partner and you cant get anything like a fair value for your holdings at the present time theres no one else you can sell them to under our articles of partnership one partner has to give the other six months notice before i understand all that pemberton said impatiently whats the price ten thousand bass said ten thousand pemberton shouted my god youre crazy the business is worth fifty thousand im going to have an audit made in order to determine a fair figure but i know my shares worth twentyfive ill take twenty for it and thats the lowest price ill even consider there was relief in bass voice that settles it then and im glad to hear it you know pemberton i was afraid you were in a jam over money matters and might have considered ten thousand dollars it would be an awful mistake i dont want you to sell pemberton started to swear bass said well im glad we have an understanding on that harvey of course i wouldnt try to exert any pressure to hold you here in some ways it would be a good business deal for me to buy you out now but i dont want to do it either for my sake or yours id have paid you every cent i could have scraped up butwell im glad youre staying the business needs you and i need you and you need the business well ill be going see you later good night over the electrical gadget came the sound of a slamming door pemberton yelled come back here arthur i want to talk with you but there was no other sound i exchanged glances with our client you see she said hes trying to sell the business that vamp would get most of the money hed probably run away with her i want you to stop that whats the program now i asked i think he has an appointment with her she said the janitor told me that hed left instructions to pass a young woman to his office pretty soon i heard the clang of the elevator door and light quick steps in the corridor past our door then a gentle tapping on the panels of the adjoining office i put the head phones back on and heard the sound of a door opening and closing did you bring the letters harvey pemberton asked a womans voice said dont be such an old granny kiss me and quit worrying about the letters theyre in a safe place you said you could put your hand on them any time pemberton charged and were going to bring them here to show me just what id written i brought you copies instead she said my lawyer wouldnt let me take the originals why not i dont know i guess he doesnt trust me harvey i dont want you to think that im utterly mercenary but you broke my heart it isnt money im after dear i want you but you hurt me and i went to that horrid lawyer and he had me sign some papers and now it seems i have to go through with it unless you go away with me thats what i want my lawyer tells me you cant sue a married man for breach of promise pemberton interrupted i think your lawyer is a shyster whos trying to stir up trouble and turn you into a blackmailer no he isnt harvey theres some wrinkle in the law if a girl doesnt know a mans married and he conceals that fact from her why then he can be sued for breach of promise just the same as though he hadnt been married oh harvey i dont want to deal with all these lawyers i want you cant you divorce that woman and come with me apparently not harvey pemberton said since youve been such a little fool and signed your life away to this lawyer he isnt going to let me get free theres enough stuff in those letters to keep me from getting a divorce from my wife and she wont get a divorce from me unless i turn over everything in the world to her she wants to strip me clean you want to do almost that for a moment there was silence then the sound of a woman sobbing pemberton started speaking again his voice rose and fell at regular intervals and i gathered he was walking the floor and talking as he walked go ahead and sob he said sit there and bawl into your handkerchief and if you want to know it it looks fishy as hell to me when i first met you on that steamboat you didnt have any of this bawling complex you wanted to play around you wwwanted to mmmarry me she wailed all right he told her i was on the upandup on that too i thought my wife was going to get a divorce hells fire i didnt have to use marriage for bait you know that that came afterward then when i break a date with you because of a business deal you rush up to see this lawyer i went to him as a friend she said in a wailing helpless voice id known him for years he told me youd been tttrifling with me and i should get rrevenge after all all i want is just enough to get me bbback on my feet once more pemberton said add that to what your lawyer wants and see where that leaves me why the hell dont you ditch the lawyer i ccant he made me sign papers once more there was silence then pemberton said how the hell do i know youre on the level you could have engineered this whole business you know me better than that she sobbed im not so certain i do pemberton told her you were a pushover for me and now her voice came in good and strong then all right then she said if you dont want the pill sugarcoated well make it bitter im getting tired of putting on this sobsister act for you i never saw a sucker who was so damn dumb in my life you seem to think a middleaged old gander is going to get a sweet innocent girl to fall for just your own sweet self bunk if youd been a good spender taken what you wanted and left me with a few knickknacks id have thought you were swell but you thought i was an innocent little kid whod fall for this model t line of yours all right get a load of this youre being stood up and whatre you going to do about it i have your letters they show the kind of game you were trying to play so quite stalling so thats it is it he said youve been a dirty doublecrosser all along oh im a doublecrosser am i just a minute mr harvey pemberton and ill read from one of your letters figure how it will sound to the jury remember sweetheart that except for the silly conventions of civilization we are already man and wife there is of course a ceremony to be performed but ill attend to that just as soon as i can arrange certain business details it would hurt certain business plans which are rapidly coming to maturity if i should announce i was going to marry you right now i ask you to have confidence in me sweetheart and to know that i cherish you i could no more harm you than i could crush a beautiful rose i love you my sweetheart she broke off and said god knows how much more of that drivel there is you dirty doublecrossing tramp he said her voice sounded less loud i gathered shed moved over toward the door now then she said quit stalling you have twentyfour hours either put up or shut up i heard the door slam then the click of heels in the hall and after a moment the clang of an elevator door all was silent in the other office i slipped the head pieces off my head well mrs pemberton said there it is in a nutshell i suppose hell sell out to bass for about half what his interest is worth and that little redhead will get it all how do you know shes redheaded i asked ive seen her and ive had detectives on her tail turning up her past and trying to get something on her i cant uncover a thing on her though she dressed the window for this play all right i told her let your husband go ahead and fight even if he cant prove anything a jury isnt going to give her so much in the line of damages it isnt that alone she said its a question of the letters he writes foolish letters whenever he loses his head he goes all the way he cant learn to keep his fountain pen in his pocket remember that bass pemberton have some rather influential clients they cant carry out business unless those clients believe in the business acumen of the members of the partnership those things blow over i told her your husband could take a trip to europe you dont understand she said he made a fool of himself once before thats why bass had a clause in the partnership contract each of them put in two thousand dollars when they started the partnership the articles of partnership provide that neither can sell his interest without first giving six months notice to his partner and then theres some provision in the contract by which bass can buy harvey out by returning the original two thousand dollars to him if harvey gets in any more trouble with women i dont know the exact provision now then i want you to nip this thing in the bud harvey s desperate somethings got to be done within twentyfour hours all right i told her ill see what i can do whats the girls address diane locke apartment a fortytwo fifteen centre street and it wont do you any good to try and frame her because shes wise to all the tricks i think shes a professional but try and prove it one thing more i told her i want the name of the lawyer you mean diane lockes lawyer yes i cant give it to you why not i dont know it she said hes keeping very much in the background hes some friend of the girls probably hes afraid he might be disbarred for participating in a blackmail action how long has this thing been going on i asked you mean the affair with that redhead it started no i said i mean this indicating the office with a sweep of my hand since i couldnt get anywhere with the detective agency she said olaf the janitor is an electrician he helped me rig things up he got some old parts think you can trust him with my life she said i lit a cigarette and said how about the washroom is it open ill have to give you my key she told me opening her handbag then she hesitated a second and said i think its in another purse but the locks mostly ornamental any key will work it or you can use the tip of a penknife i looked down into her handbag whats the idea of the gun for protection she said closing the bag all right i told her pass it over im your protection now youll get in trouble with that gun she hesitated a moment while i held my hand out then reluctantly took the gun from her purse and hesitated with it in her hand but suppose youre not with me and something should happen suppose he should find the wires and follow them in here and catch me keep with me all the time i told her the business end of the gun waved around in a halfcircle want me to go with you now she asked dont be a sap i told her im going to the washroom ill be right back and if my husband comes in while youre gone i suppose im to tell him its not fair that youre seeing a man about a dog and he mustnt choke me until you get back i strode over to the door keep your plaything until i come back i said when we go out you either get rid of the gun or get rid of me youre the one whos paying the money so you can take your choice i crossed the office to the door opened it and pushed the catch so i could open the door from the outside i wondered what would happen if harvey pemberton should make up his mind to go to the washroom while i was in there or should meet me in the corridor id kill that chance by going to the floor below i saw stairs to the right of the elevator and went down the mens room was at the far end of the corridor the first key on my ring did the trick five minutes later when i got back to mrs pemberton i saw that she was nervous and upset whats the matter i asked did something happen she said in a nervous strained voice i was just thinking of what would happen if my husband ran into you in the corridor i said well he didnt you shouldnt take chances like that she told me i grinned i didnt i ran down the stairs for a couple of flights and used the room on the fourth floor her face showed relief all right i told her lets go well pick up my baggage and then im going to take you home then if you dont mind ill borrow your car i have work to do have you any plan she asked im an opportunist all right she said lets go wed better run down the stairs and ring the elevator from the lower floor we started for the door she clicked out the light just a minute i told her youre forgetting something what the gun its all right i thought it over i decided you were right about it so i ditched the gun where in the desk drawer i switched the lights back on and went over to look the upper righthand drawer she said her voice showing amusement i opened the drawer the gun was there i picked it up started to put it in my pocket then changed my mind and dropped it back in the drawer come on i told her closing the drawer and switching off the lights we sneaked across the hall and down the flight of stairs to the lower floor i rang for the elevator olaf brought the cage up and i took another look at him he was a big rawboned swede with a bony nose a drooping blond moustache and dog eyes his eyes never left mrs pemberton all the way down to the ground floor mrs pemberton kept her head turned away from him toward the side of the elevator shaft watching the doors creep by when we got to the ground floor she turned and looked at him it was some look his eyes glowed back at her like a couple of coals olaf opened the door i took mrs pembertons arm and we crossed over to the parking station ill drive i told her i want to get accustomed to the car i drove down to the station got my baggage and drove mrs pemberton back out to the house the butler carried my things up and showed me my room after he left i opened my suitcase there were two guns in it i selected one with a shiny leather shoulder holster i put it on under my coat and knocked on the door of mrs pembertons room she opened the door and stood in the doorway the light was behind her throwing shadows of seductive curves through billowy gossamer silk i resolutely kept my eyes on her face im going out i told her will you hear me when i come in yes she said ill wait up if i cough when i pass your door it means i have good news for you if i dont cough it means things arent going so well she nodded stepped toward me so that her lithe body was very close to mine she put her hand on my arm and said in that peculiar throaty voice of hers please be careful i nodded and turned away my eyes hadnt strayed once walking down the corridor and tiptoeing down the stairs i reflected that i never had known a woman with that peculiar husky note in her voice who didnt like to tease the animals fortytwo fifteen centre street was a threestory frame apartment house the lower floor given over to stores a doorway from the street opened on a flight of stairs i tried the door and it was unlocked i went back to sit in the car and think it was queer the lawyer had never appeared in the picture except as a shadowy figure no one knew his name he was quoted freely but he left it up to his client to do all the negotiating therefore if the racket turned out to be successful the client would be the one to collect the money then it would be up to her to pay the lawyer that didnt sound right to me it was like adding two and two and getting two as the answer i looked the block over there was a little jewellery store in the first floor of the apartment house it was closed up now with a night light in the window showing a few cheap wrist watches and some costume jewellery i drove around the corner and parked the car a catchall drugstore was open i went in bought some adhesive tape a small bottle of benzine a package of cotton a writing pad and a police whistle got any cheap imitation pearls i asked the clerk he had some strings at fortynine cents i took one of those then i went out to the car cut the string of pearls and threw all but four of them away i pulled a wad of cotton out of the box put the four pearls in the cotton and stuffed the wad in my pocket i popped the pasteboard off the back of the writing pad cut two eyeholes in it and a place for my nose i reinforced it with adhesive tape and left ends of adhesive tape on it so i could put it on at a moments notice then i climbed the stairs of the apartment house and located apartment a there was a light inside the apartment i could hear the sound of a radio and gathered the door wasnt very thick i took a small multipletool holder from my pocket and fitted a gimlet into the handle i put a little grease on the point of the gimlet bent over and went to work the best place to bore a hole in a panelled door is in the upper right or lefthand corner of the lower panel the wood is almost paperthin there and doesnt take much of a hole to give a complete view of a room detectives have used it from time immemorial but its still a good trick after the hole is bored a little chewing gum keeps light from coming through the inside of the door and attracting the attention of a casual passerby making certain the corridor was deserted i dropped to one knee and peeked through the hole id made the girl was redheaded all right she was listening to the radio and reading a newspaper watching through one hole to make certain that she didnt move in case my gimlet made any noise i bored two more holes that gave me a chance to see all of the apartment there was i put a thin coating of chewing gum over each of the holes went downstairs and waited for a moment when the sidewalk was deserted and there were no cars in sight on the street then i took the police whistle from my pocket and blew three shrill blasts by the time the windows in the apartments commenced to come up id ducked into the doorway and started up the stairs i held my pasteboard mask in my left hand all i had to do was to raise it to my face and the adhesive tape would clamp it into position i backed up against the door of apartment a and knocked with my knuckles when i heard steps coming toward the door i slapped my left hand up to my face putting the mask in position and jerked the gun out of my shoulder holster the redhead opened the door and i backed in the gun menacing the corridor once inside of the door i made a quick whirl kicked the door shut and covered her with the gun not a peep out of you i said shed put on a negligee and was holding it tightly about her throat her face was white all right sister i told her get a load of this if any copper comes wandering down the hallway you go to the door to see what he wants if he asks you if anyones in here or if youve seen anyone in the corridor tell him no the reason youll tell him no is that im going to be standing just behind the door with this gun theyre never going to take me alive id just as soon go out fighting as to be led up thirteen steps and dropped through a hole in the floor get it she was white to the lips but she nodded her eyes large round and dilated with fright i stuck up that jewellery store downstairs i told her and ive got some swag thats worth money now i want some wrapping paper and some string im going to drop that swag in the first mailbox i come to and let uncle sam take the responsibility of the delivery get me she swallowed a couple of times and said yyes and ill tell you something else dont hold that filmy stuff so tight around you im not going to bite you but if a cop comes to the door and sees you all bundled up that way hell figure out whats happened if theres a knock i want you to open the door a crack and have that thing pretty well open in front when you do then you can pull it shut when you see theres a man at the door and give a little squeal and say oh i thought it was mamie do you get that youre asking a lot of me she said i made motions with the business end of the gun youve got a nice figure i said it would be a shame to blow it in two these are softnosed bullets youd have splinters from your spinal cord all mixed into your hip bone if i pulled this trigger the cop in the doorway would get the next shot then id take a chance on the fireescape she didnt say anything and i jabbed at her with the gun come on how about the wrapping paper she opened a door into a little kitchenette pulled out a drawer there was brown paper and string in there i said get over there away from the window stand over there in the corner i crossed over to the little card table there was an ashtray there with four or five cigarette ends in it and some burnt matches i noticed that a couple of the matches had been broken in two i pushed the tray to one side spread the paper out and took the cotton from my pocket when i opened the cotton she saw the four big pearls nested in it and gave a little gasp standing eight or ten feet away as she was and seeing those pearls on the cotton she felt she was looking at ready money that all you took she asked in a voice that had a cantwebefriends note in it is that all i took i asked and laughed a nasty sarcastic laugh that jeweller i told her has been trying to get those four pearls for a client for more than two years theyre perfectly matched pearls that came in from the south seas and in case you want to know it they didnt pay any duty i know what im after before i heist a joint i put the cotton around the pearls again wrapped them in the paper tied the paper with string and ostentatiously set my gun on the corner of the table while i took a fountain pen from my pocket to write an address on the package i printed the first name which popped into my head and a los angeles address then i reached in my pocket took out my wallet and from it extracted a strip of postage stamps whatwhat are they worth she asked singly i told her they arent worth over five thousand apiece but the four of them taken together with that perfect matching and lustre are worth forty grand in any mans dough i shot her a look to see if she thought there was anything phoney about my appraisal she didnt her eyes were commencing to narrow now as ideas raced through her head i suppose she told me youll peddle them to a fence and only get about a tenth of what theyre worth well a tenth of forty grand buys a lot of hamburgers i told her she moved over toward a small table slid one hip up on that and let the negligee slide carelessly open apparently too much interested in the pearls to remember that she wasnt clothed for the street she had plenty to look at that girl you make a working girl dizzy she said wistfully think how hard id have to work to make four thousand dollars not with that shape indignantly she pulled the robe around her then she leaned forward let the silk slip from her fingers and slide right back along the smooth line of her leg i suppose its wicked of me she said but i cant help thinking what an awful shame it is to sell anything as valuable as that for a fraction of what its worth i should think youd get yourself some goodlooking female accomplice someone who could really wear clothes you could doll her up with some glad rags and show up in santa barbara or hollywood or perhaps in new orleans she could stay at a swell hotel make friends and finally confide to one of her gentlemen friends that she was temporarily embarrassed and wanted to leave some security with him and get a really good loan gosh you know there are lots of ways of playing a game like that i frowned contemplatively youve got something there baby i told her but it would take a girl who could wear clothes itd take a baby whod be able to knock em dead and keep her head while she was doing it itd take a fast thinker and it would take someone whod be one hundred per cent loyal where are you going to find a moll like that she got up off the table gave a little shrug with her shoulders and the negligee slipped down to the floor she turned slowly around as though shed been modelling the peachcoloured underwear i can wear clothes she said i let my eyes show suspicion yeah i told her you sure got what it takes on that end but how do i know you wouldnt cross me to the bulls if anybody came along and offered a reward her eyes were starry now she came toward me i dont doublecross people i like she said i liked you from the minute i saw yousomething in your voice something in the way you look i dont know what it is when i fall i fall fast and i fall hard and i play the game all the way you and i could go places together i could put you up right here until the excitements over then we could go places and i said suspiciously you arent handing me a line handing you a line she said scornfully do i look like the sort of girl whod have to hand anyone a line im not so dumb i know i have a figure but you dont see me living in a swell apartment with some guy footing the bills do you im just a working girl plugging along and trying to be on the upandup im not saying that i like it im not even saying that im not sick of it but i am telling you that you and i could go places together you could use me and id stick now wait a minute baby i temporised let me get this package stamped and think this thing over a minute you sure have got me going gripes ive been in stir where i didnt see a frail for months on end and now you come along and dazzle me with a shape like that listen baby i i raised the stamps to my tongue licked them and started to put them on the package the wet mucilage touched my thumb and the stamps stuck i tried to shake my thumb loose and the stamps fell to the floor windmilling around as they dropped i swooped after the stamps and sensed motion over on the other side of the table i straightened to find myself staring into the business end of my gun which shed snatched up from the table now then sucker she said start reaching i stood muscles tensed hands slowly coming up now take it easy baby you wouldnt shoot me dont think i wouldnt she told me id shoot you in a minute id tell the cops youd busted in here after your stickup and i distracted your attention long enough to grab your gun that you made a grab for me and i acted in selfdefence now listen baby i told her keeping my hands up lets be reasonable about this thing i thought you and i were going away together id show you london and paris and she laughed scornfully and said what a sap id be to start travelling with a boob like you a pair of pretty legs and you forget all about your gun and leave it on the table while you chase postage stamps to the floor you going to call the cops i asked she laughed do i look dumb im going to give you a chance to escape why because she said i havent got the heart to see a nicelooking young man like you go to jail im going to call the cops and tell them i saw you in the corridor ill give you ten seconds start that ten seconds will keep you from hanging around here and calling the cops will put me in the clear in case anybody sees you oh i see i said sarcastically you mean youre going to grab off the gravy ideas dont circulate through that dome of yours very fast do they she asked i made a lunge toward the paper parcel id wrapped up but the gun snapped up to a level with my chest her eyes glittered dont crowd me you fool she said of all the dumbhead plays youve made thats the worst ill do it and dont think i dont know how to shoot a gun because i do i backed slowly away theres the door she said get going she started toward the telephone and said im going to call the cops you have ten seconds i spilled a lot of cuss words to make the act look good unlocked the door jerked it open and jumped out into the corridor i made pounding noises with my feet in the direction of the fireescape and then tiptoed back i heard a metallic click as she shot the bolt home in the door after waiting a couple of minutes i dropped to one knee and peeked through the hole in the door she was over at the table ripping the wrappings from the parcel i straightened and pounded with my knuckles on the door police call i said in a deep gruff voice open up her voice sounded thick with sleep what is it police i said and dropped again to put an eye to the peerhole in the door she ran to a corner of the carpet raised it did something to the floor and then snatched up a kimono i pounded with my knuckles again coming she said drowsily she twisted back the bolt opened the door about the width of a newspaper and asked what do you want i stood aside so she couldnt see me were looking for a man who robbed the jewellery store downstairs i growled in my throat we think he came up here well he didnt would you mind letting me in she hesitated a moment then said oh very well if you have to come in i guess you have to just a minute ill put something on all right she pulled the door back i pushed my way into the room and kicked the door shut she looked at me with wide terrorstricken eyes then jumped back and said listen you cant pull this ill have the police here ill i walked directly to the corner of the carpet she flung herself at me i pushed her off i pulled back the corner of the carpet and saw nothing except floor but i knew it was there and kept looking pressing with my fingers suddenly i found ita little cunningly joined section in the hardwood floor i opened it my package had been shoved in there and down below it was a package of letters bending down so that my body concealed just what i was doing i pulled out pearls and letters and stuffed them in my inside coat pocket when i straightened i found myself facing the gun i told you you couldnt get away with this she warned ill claim you held up the jewellery store and then crashed the gate here whatre you going to do about that nothing i told her smiling i have everything i came for i can kill you she said and the police would give me a vote of thanks you could i told her but nice girls dont go around killing men i saw her face contort in a spasm of emotion the hell they dont she said and pulled the trigger the hammer clicked on an empty cylinder she reinforced the index finger of her right hand with the index finger of her left her eyes were blazing she clicked the empty cylinder six times and then threw the gun at me i caught it by the barrel and sidestepped her rush she tripped over a chair and fell on the couch take it easy i told her she raised her voice then and started to call me names at the end of the first twenty seconds i came to the conclusion i didnt know any words she didnt i started for the door she made a dash for the telephone and was yelling police headquarters into the transmitter as i closed the door and drifted noiselessly down the corridor in the hallway i pulled off the pasteboard mask moistened a piece of cotton in the benzine and scrubbed off the bits of adhesive which had stuck to my face and forehead i wadded the mask into a ball walked around to my car and drove away i heard the siren of a police radio car when i was three blocks away the machine roared by me doing a good sixty miles an hour walking down the corridor of the pemberton home i coughed as i passed mrs pembertons door i walked into my bedroom and waited nothing happened i took out the letters and looked at them they were plenty torrid some men like to put themselves on paper harvey pemberton had indulged himself to the limit i heard a scratching noise on my door then it slowly opened mrs pemberton walking as though shed carefully rehearsed her entrance came into the light of the room and pulled lacy things around her my husband hasnt come in yet she said but he may come in any minute i looked her over even supposing that im your brother i said dont you think hed like it a lot better if you had on something a little more tangible she said i wear what i want after all youre my brother well go put on a bathrobe over that i told her so i wont be so apt to forget it she moved a step or two toward the door then paused you dont need to be so conventional she said thats what you think i want to know what youve found out youre out in the clear i told her all we need now is to i broke off as i heard the sound of an automobile outside there was a businesslike snarl to the motor which i didnt like and somebody wore off a lot of rubber as the car was slammed to a stop thats harvey now she said harvey wouldnt park his car at the curb in front would he i asked no she admitted get back to your room i told her but i dont see what youre so get started i said very well sir galahad she told me she started down the corridor toward her room i heard the pound of feet as someone ran around the house toward the back door then i heard feet on the stairs crossing the porch and the doorbell rang four or five times long insistent rings i slipped some shells into the empty chambers of my gun switched off the lights opened my door picked up my bag and waited i heard mrs pemberton go to the head of the stairs stand there listening after a moment i heard the rustle of her clothes as she started down i stepped out to the hallway and stood still i heard her say who is it and a voice boom an answer through the closed door police it said open up but ii dont understand open up she unlocked the door i heard men coming into the corridor then a mans voice say im lieutenant sylvester i want to talk with you youre mrs pemberton yes but i cant understand what could bring you here at this hour after all lieutenant im im sorry the lieutenant interrupted this is about your husband when did you see him last why just this evening what time this evening why i dont know exactly where did you see him last will you please tell me the reason for these questions where he repeated did you see your husband last well if you insist on knowing he was here for dinner and then left for the office about seventhirty and you havent seen him since no the officer said im sorry mrs pemberton but your husbands body was found on the floor of his office by the janitor about half an hour ago my husbands body she screamed yes maam the lieutenant said hed been killed by two bullets fired from a thirtytwo calibre automatic the ejected shells were on the floor of his office in an adjoining office furnished with a dilapidated desk and a couple of chairs we found a homerigged microphone arrangement which would work as a dictograph in the drawer of that desk we found the gun with which the murder had been committed now mrs pemberton what do you know about it there was silence for a second or two then she said in a thin frightened voice why i dont know anything about it what do you know about that office next to your husbands nothing youve never been in there this time she didnt hesitate no she said never i dont know what makes you think i would be spying on my husband perhaps someone has hired detectives i wouldnt know i tiptoed back to my room picked up my bag and started silently down the corridor toward the back stairs i could hear the rumble of a mans voice from the front room and at intervals the thin shrill sound of mrs pembertons halfhysterical answers i felt my way down the back stairs there was a glass window in the back door with a shade drawn over it i raised a corner of the shade and peered through the glass i could see the bulky figure of a man silhouetted against the lights which filtered in from the back yard he was holding a sawedoff police riot gun in his hands i took a flashlight from my pocket and started exploring the kitchen i found the door to the cellar and went down from the floor above came the scrape of chairs then the noise of feet moving about the house there was a little window in the cellar i scraped cobwebs away and shook off a couple of spiders i could feel crawling on my hand i worked the catch on the sash and pulled it open it dropped down on hinges and hung down on the inside i pushed my bag out breathed a prayer to lady luck and gave a jump my elbows caught on the cement i wiggled and twisted pulling myself up and fighting to keep the side of the window from catching on my knees and coming up with me i scrambled out to the lawn no one was watching this side of the house i picked up my bag tiptoed across the lawn and pushed my way through a hedge in the next yard a dog commenced to bark i turned back to the sidewalk and started walking fast i looked back over my shoulder and saw lights coming on in the second story of the pemberton house i walked faster from a pay station i put in a long distance call for old e b jonathan e b didnt appreciate being called out of his slumber but i didnt give him a chance to do any crabbing your client down here i told him is having trouble well he said it can keep until morning no i told him i dont think it can why cant it shes going to jail whats she going to jail for taking a couple of pot shots at her husband with a thirtytwo automatic did she hit him dead centre where does that leave you jonathan asked as a fugitive from justice talking from a pay station i told him the janitor will testify that i was with her when she went up to the place where the shooting occurred the janitor is her dog he lies down and rolls over when she snaps her fingers she thinks itd be nice to make me the goat you mean by blaming the shooting on you exactly what makes you think so id trust some women a hell of a lot more than you do and some women a hell of a lot less this one i trust a lot less shes a client e b said testily she wouldnt do that i know shes a client i told him that may put whitewash all over her as far as youre concerned but it doesnt as far as im concerned i made her ditch the gun out of her handbag so she wouldnt be tempted to use it i got my fingerprints on the gun doing it when the going gets rough shell think of that and the janitor in the building will swear to anything she suggests he made clucking noises with his tongue against the roof of his mouth ill have boniface drive down there right away he said where can boniface find you nowhere i said and hung up there was an allnight hamburger stand down by the depot i ordered six hamburgers with plenty of onions and had them put in a bag to take out id noticed there was a roominghouse across from the apartment where diane locke lived i went there the landlady grumbled about the lateness of the hour but i paid two days rent in advance and she showed me a front room i said to her i work nights and will be sleeping daytimes please dont let anyone disturb me i told her i was peter j gibbens from seattle she digested this sleepily and ambled away i found a do not disturb sign in the room which i hung on the door i locked the door and went to bed about three oclock in the afternoon i sneaked out in the hallway for a reconnaissance there were newspapers on the desk i picked up one left a nickel and went back to the room my own picture stared at me from the front page peter wennick connected with prominent law firm in the metropolis being sought for questioning by local police in connection with pemberton murder this was in bold black type it was quite an account mrs pemberton had told all she had consulted the law firm in connection with some blackmail letters the law firm had said i was a leg man and detective i had been sent down to investigate the situation and report on the evidence she had taken me to the office where with a friendly janitor she had rigged up a dictaphone i had listened to a conversation between her husband and the woman in the case on the pretext of leaving for the washroom i had thrown the night latch on the door of the office so i could return at any time she had forgotten to put the night latch back on when we left therefore i had left myself an opportunity to return and gain access to the room the janitor remembered when we had left something like an hour later he had heard muffled sounds which could have been the two shots which were fired he thought they had been the sounds of backfire from a truck hed been in the basement reading the sounds had apparently come from the alley but might have been shots echoed back from the walls of an adjoining building the medical authorities fixed the time of death as being probably half an hour to an hour and a half after wed left the building mrs pemberton had insisted shed gone home and that i had immediately gone out she didnt know where i had returned to tell her that i had good news for her but before i could report police had come to the house to question her in connection with her husbands death i had made my escape through a cellar window while police were searching the house arthur h bass pembertons partner had stated that pemberton had been very much worried for the past few days that he had announced it was necessary for him to raise immediate funds and had offered to sell his interest in the partnership business for much less than its value bass had reluctantly made a nominal offer but had advised pemberton not to accept it and when pemberton had refused to consider such a nominal amount bass had been jubilant because he didnt want to lose pemberton as a partner he had met pemberton at pembertons request to discuss the matter the district attorney announced that he had interviewed the woman in the case inasmuch as she seemed to have been wronged by pemberton and inasmuch as a peeping tom who had tried to crash the gate of her apartment had caused her to place a call for the police at approximately the time pemberton must have been killed the police absolved her of all responsibility it seemed that this peeping tom evidently trying to make a mash had knocked at her door and advised her he had held up the jewellery store downstairs she had promptly reported to the police who had visited her apartment to find her very much undressed very much excited and shaken and apparently sincere police records of the call showed that the police were actually in her apartment at the time the janitor had heard the sounds of what were undoubtedly the shots which took pembertons life mrs pemberton the news account went on to say could give no evidence in support of her alibi but police were inclined to absolve her of blame concentrating for the moment on a search for pete wennick the leg man for the law firm cedric l boniface a member of the law firm very much shocked at developments had made a rush trip to the city and was staying at the palace hotel so far authorities had not let him talk to mrs pemberton but they would probably do so at an early hour in the afternoon mr boniface said he hoped mr wennick would be able to absolve himself that was that just for the fun of the thing i turned to the personals its a habit with me i always read them in any paper under the heading too late to classify i came on one which interested me it read simply p w can i help call on me for anything m d now there was a girl old e b jonathan with his warped distorted jaundiced idea of the sex suspected all women except clients clients to him were sacred i took women as i found them mae devers would stick through thick and thin mrs pemberton had paraded around in revealing silks and had called me sir galahad when id told her to go put on a bathrobe the minute the going got rough shed tossed me to the wolves the question was whether she either killed her husband while i was in the washroom or had gone back and killed him afterwards and deliberately imported me as the fall guy for the police if she had shed made a damn good job of it supper consisted of a couple of cold hamburgers about five oclock i drew up a chair in front of the window and started watching the redhead had accused me of being a peeping tom and now i was going to be one i didnt see diane locke come in or go out and i didnt see anyone else i knew after it got dark a light came on in dianes apartment i sat there and waited about nine oclock i had another hamburger i got tired of waiting and decided id force the play i looked up the telephone number of bass pembertons office and memorised it it was temple i shaved combed my hair put on a suit none of my new playmates had seen me wear crossed the street climbed the stairs of the apartment house and knocked on the door of apartment a nothing happened at once i dropped to one knee scooped dried chewing gum out of the hole in the door and looked through she was coming toward the door and she had her clothes on i straightened as she came to the door opened it and asked what is it im from the police i said in a thin high nasal voice this time im trying to check up on that call you put through to police headquarters last night yes she asked shed never seen me without a mask what is it you wanted to know im trying to check your call i told her if you dont mind ill come in i came in before she had a chance to mind i walked over to the chair and sat down she sat down in the other chair the chair i was sitting in was warm pardon me i said was this your chair no i was sitting in this one she told me she looked at me and said ive seen you before theres something vaguely familiar about your face and i think ive heard your voice somewhere i grinned across at her and said i never contradict a lady but if id ever met you id remember it until i was a hundred and ten she smiled at that and crossed her knees i looked over at the ashtray there were two cigarette stubs on it both were smouldering there was only one match in the tray it was broken in two she followed the direction of my eyes laughed and pinched out the stubs im always leaving cigarette stubs burning she said what was it you wanted i slid my hand under the lapel of my coat and loosened the gun miss locke i said you understand that the time element here is important its a question of when you placed that call to the police as well as when the police got here we want to check carefully on all those times now in order to do that ive been checking your calls with the telephone company it seems that you put through a call to temple very shortly after you called the police can you tell me about that call she studied her tinted fingernails for a minute then raised her eyes and said yes frankly i can i called mr pemberton why did you call him she said i think youll understand that i felt very close to mr pemberton in many ways he hadwell hed tricked me and betrayed me but nevertheless oh i just hated to make trouble for him i called him to tell him i was sorry did you talk with him my throat was getting irritated from straining my voice high once more she hesitated then said no he didnt answer the telephone the telephone company has you on a limited call basis i said they report that the call was completed once more she studied her fingernails someone answered the phone she said but said he was the janitor cleaning up the offices so i hung up on him that gave me all i wanted to know i said and i spoke in my own voice now you know it was a dirty trick they played on you diane i dont think bass cared whether you got anything out of it or not he wanted pembertons interest in the partnership in fact he had to have it because hed been juggling funds he was the mythical lawyer behind you youre his woman and he put you up to playing pemberton for a sucker hoping pemberton would be involved enough so he could put into effect that trick clause in the partnership agreement and buy him out for two thousand dollars when pemberton said he was going to have an auditor make a complete analysis of the books for the purpose of finding out what a half interest was worth bass went into a panic she went white to her lips but said nothing i went on as soon as your burglar left and you found youd lost the letters you called bass up and told him what had happened he was in his private office waiting for a call waiting also for pemberton to come back and accept his offer as a final last resort but bass was pretty smooth he probably knew i wasnt olive pembertons brother he guessed i was a detective that meant olive was wise to the diane business and he was shrewd enough to figure there might be a dictograph running into pembertons office he did a little exploring the door to the adjoining office was unlocked and he stepped in looked the plant over and found the gun obviously either olive or i had left the gun there it could be traced to one of us it looked like a setup bass took the gun with him did the job and returned it killing pemberton was his only out without the letters his little blackmail scheme had fallen through thered be no money coming in to cover the shortage the audit would turn up that meant hed go to prison well hell go anyway and hell stay just long enough to be made ready for a pine box by this time the redhead had recognised me of course you and your pearls she sneered but the sneer was only a camouflage for the growing fright in her eyes now i went on youre in bass way bass cant have the police knowing he was behind the blackmail business and you can show he was hell have to try to get rid of both of us arthur would never do anything like that she cried the closet door was in front of me the bathroom door was behind me but a mirror in the closet door enabled me to see the bathroom one i kept my eyes on these doors he will though i told her and you know it hes already killed once otherwise why did he come here tonight to tell you that under no circumstances were you to admit youd talked with him over the telephone she moistened her lips with her tongue how do you know all these things she asked i know them i told her because i know that persons who have ever worked as forest rangers in the dry country make it an invariable habit to break their matches in two before they throw them away i know that he was here the other night because there were broken matches in your ashtray hed sent you up to put the screws on harvey pemberton i know that hes here tonight i know he was in the office last night just before you came in hed been talking with harvey pemberton i didnt hear him take the elevator so i know he went in to his private office after hed finished that talk he was still there when i left im wennick but he wouldnt have done anything like that she said arthur couldnt but you did telephone right after those letters had been stolen and told him about it didnt you yes she said i the door behind me opened a half inch i saw the muzzle of the gun slowly creep out but it wasnt until i had my fingers on the butt of my own gun that i realised the barrel wasnt pointing at me but at her duck i yelled i think it was the sudden yell which frightened her half out of her wits she didnt duck but she recoiled from me as though id thrown a brick at her instead of my voice the gun went off the bullet whizzed through the air right where her head had been and buried itself in the plaster i whirled and shot through the door i saw the gun barrel waver i shot again and then an arm came into sight drooping toward the floor the gun fell from nerveless fingers and arthur bass crashed full length into the room old e b glowered at me with little malevolent eyes which glittered from above the bluishwhite pouches which puffed out from under his eyeballs wennick he said you look like the devil im sorry i told him you look dissipated i havent shaved yet from all reports he said you cleaned up this pemberton murder case and were released by the police at culverton with a vote of thanks some time before ten oclock yesterday evening cedric boniface was in the law library briefing the question of premeditation in connection with murder he didnt know what had happened until after the police had obtained bass dying statement and you had left i nodded now then e b said why the hell is it that you didnt report to me im sorry i told him but after all i have social engagements social engagements he stormed you were out with some woman i nodded i was out with a young lady i admitted celebrating her birthday he started cracking his knuckles out with a young lady he snorted i had your apartment watched so i could be notified the minute you got in you didnt get in until six oclock this morning i listened to the dull cracking of his knuckles then grinned at him the young lady i said happens to have been born at five oclock in the morning so i had to wait until then to help her celebrate her birthday if you doubt me you might ask mae devers raymond chandler raymond chandler the writer who proved that privateeye fiction can be high art was born in chicago but educated in england where his mother moved after his father faded from the scene he worked in the english civil service wrote newspaper articles and poetry and moved to california in with the outbreak of world war i he enlisted in the canadian army fought in france was injured and returned to california by he had become a vice president of an oil company he didnt begin publishing hardboiled privateeye short stories in the pulps until the year after the oil company fired him for drunkenness chandler wrote slowly and struggled with plots he disdained the puzzleoriented detective story in the british tradition referring to it as an exhausting concatenation of insignificant clues in his landmark essay the simple art of murder he stated his belief that it is better to give characters their heads and let them make their own mystery in the same essay chandler articulated the grace that takes fiction to the level of art and moulds the raw stuff of an ordinary protagonist into a hero in everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption chandler wrote it may be pure tragedy if it is high tragedy and it may be pity and irony and it may be the raucous laughter of the strong man but down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean who is neither tarnished nor afraid the detective in this kind of story must be such a man he is the hero he is everything chandler s work gained the immense admiration of readers the world over more significantly his work is admired by other writers it has been said that chandler s work has done more to influence american writers who followed him than did the oeuvre of an author like f scott fitzgerald who was a darling of the literary and academic establishment and his influence is not confined to those writing genre fiction the private eye in chandler s novels is philip marlowe a selfdeclared romantic who thinks of himself with a trace of selfcontempt as a sort of knight in a corrupt decadent society where chivalry is an aberration chandler admired dashiell hammetts work and marlowe can be described as sam spade with morals and introspection added while ill be waiting doesnt include marlowe it does display chandlers genius in choosing the telling detail to establish mood and create a scene that lingers in the mind and in using the genre for powerful social commentary it also reveals his ambivalence toward his women characters and his tendency to leave things not quite resolved in a sense ill be waiting is as much a love story as it is a crime tale ill be waiting at one oclock in the morning carl the night porter turned down the last of three table lamps in the main lobby of the windermere hotel the blue carpet darkened a shade or two and the walls drew back into remoteness the chairs filled with shadowy loungers in the corners were memories like cobwebs tony reseck yawned he put his head on one side and listened to the frail twittery music from the radio room beyond a dim arch at the far side of the lobby he frowned that should be his radio room after one a m nobody should be in it that redhaired girl was spoiling his nights the frown passed and a miniature of a smile quirked at the corners of his lips he sat relaxed a short pale paunchy middleaged man with long delicate fingers clasped on the elks tooth on his watch chain the long delicate fingers of a sleightofhand artist fingers with shiny moulded nails and tapering first joints fingers a little spatulate at the ends handsome fingers tony reseck rubbed them gently together and there was peace in his quiet seagray eyes the frown came back on his face the music annoyed him he got up with a curious litheness all in one piece without moving his clasped hands from the watchchain at one moment he was leaning back relaxed and the next he was standing balanced on his feet perfectly still so that the movement of rising seemed to be a thing perfectly perceived an error of vision he walked with small polished shoes delicately across the blue carpet and under the arch the music was louder it contained the hot acid blare the frenetic jittering runs of a jam session it was too loud the redhaired girl sat there and stared silently at the fretted part of the big radio cabinet as though she could see the band with its fixed professional grin and the sweat running down its back she was curled up with her feet under her on a davenport which seemed to contain most of the cushions in the room she was tucked among them carefully like a corsage in the florists tissue paper she didnt turn her head she leaned there one hand in a small fist on her peachcoloured knee she was wearing lounging pyjamas of heavy ribbed silk embroidered with black lotus buds you like goodman miss cressy tony reseck asked the girl moved her eyes slowly the light in there was dim but the violet of her eyes almost hurt they were large deep eyes without a trace of thought in them her face was classical and without expression she said nothing tony smiled and moved his fingers at his sides one by one feeling them move you like goodman miss cressy he repeated gently not to cry over the girl said tonelessly tony rocked back on his heels and looked at her eyes large deep empty eyes or were they he reached down and muted the radio dont get me wrong the girl said goodman makes money and a lad that makes legitimate money these days is a lad you have to respect but this jitterbug music gives me the backdrop of a beer flat i like something with roses in it maybe you like mozart tony said go on kid me the girl said i wasnt kidding you miss cressy i think mozart was the greatest man that ever livedand toscanini is his prophet i thought you were the house dick she put her head back on a pillow and stared at him through her lashes make me some of that mozart she added its too late tony sighed you cant get it now she gave him another long lucid glance got the eye on me havent you flatfoot she laughed a little almost under her breath what did i do wrong tony smiled his toy smile nothing miss cressy nothing at all but you need some fresh air youve been five days in this hotel and you havent been outdoors and you have a tower room she laughed again make me a story about it im bored there was a girl here once had your suite she stayed in the hotel a whole week like you without going out at all i mean she didnt speak to anybody hardly what do you think she did then the girl eyed him gravely she jumped her bill he put his long delicate hand out and turned it slowly fluttering the fingers with an effect almost like a lazy wave breaking unh uh she sent down for her bill and paid it then she told the hop to be back in half an hour for her suitcases then she went out on her balcony the girl leaned forward a little her eyes still grave one hand capping her peachcoloured knee what did you say your name was tony reseck sounds like a hunky yeah tony said polish go on tony all the tower suites have private balconies miss cressy the walls of them are too low for fourteen stories above the street it was a dark night that night high clouds he dropped his hand with a final gesture a farewell gesture nobody saw her jump but when she hit it was like a big gun going off youre making it up tony her voice was a clean dry whisper of sound he smiled his toy smile his quiet seagray eyes seemed almost to be smoothing the long waves of her hair eve cressy he said musingly a name waiting for lights to be in waiting for a tall dark guy thats no good tony you wouldnt care why i was married to him once i might be married to him again you can make a lot of mistakes in just one lifetime the hand on her knee opened slowly until the fingers were strained back as far as they would go then they closed quickly and tightly and even in that dim light the knuckles shone like the little polished bones i played him a low trick once i put him in a bad placewithout meaning to you wouldnt care about that either its just that i owe him something he leaned over softly and turned the knob on the radio a waltz formed itself dimly on the warm air a tinsel waltz but a waltz he turned the volume up the music gushed from the loudspeaker in a swirl of shadowed melody since vienna died all waltzes are shadowed the girl put her hand on one side and hummed three or four bars and stopped with a sudden tightening of her mouth eve cressy she said it was in lights once at a bum night club a dive they raided it and the lights went out he smiled at her almost mockingly it was no dive while you were there miss cressy thats the waltz the orchestra always played when the old porter walked up and down in front of the hotel entrance all swelled up with his medals on his chest the last laugh emil jannings you wouldnt remember that one miss cressy spring beautiful spring she said no i never saw it he walked three steps away from her and turned i have to go upstairs and palm doorknobs i hope i didnt bother you you ought to go to bed now its pretty late the tinsel waltz stopped and a voice began to talk the girl spoke through the voice you really thought something like thatabout the balcony he nodded i might have he said softly i dont any more no chance tony her smile was a dim lost leaf come and talk to me some more redheads dont jump tony they hang onand wither he looked at her gravely for a moment and then moved away over the carpet the porter was standing in the archway that led to the main lobby tony hadnt looked that way yet but he knew somebody was there he always knew if anybody was close to him he could hear the grass grow like the donkey in the blue bird the porter jerked his chin at him urgently his broad face above the uniform collar looked sweaty and excited tony stepped up close to him and they went together through the arch and out to the middle of the dim lobby trouble tony asked wearily theres a guy outside to see you tony he wont come in im doing a wipeoff on the plate glass of the doors and he comes up beside me a tall guy get tony he says out of the side of his mouth tony said uhhuh and looked at the porters pale blue eyes who was it al he said to say he was tonys face became as expressionless as dough okay he started to move off the porter caught his sleeve listen tony you got any enemies tony laughed politely his face still like dough listen tony the porter held his sleeve tightly theres a big black car down the block the other way from the hacks theres a guy standing beside it with his foot on the running board this guy that spoke to me he wears a darkcoloured wraparound overcoat with a high collar turned up against his ears his hats way low you cant hardly see his face he says get tony out of the side of his mouth you aint got any enemies have you tony only the finance company tony said beat it he walked slowly and a little stiffly across the blue carpet up the three shallow steps to the entrance lobby with the three elevators on one side and the desk on the other only one elevator was working beside the open doors his arms folded the night operator stood silent in a neat blue uniform with silver facings a lean dark mexican named gomez a new boy breaking in on the night shift the other side was the desk rose marble with the night clerk leaning on it delicately a small neat man with a wispy reddish moustache and cheeks so rosy they looked rouged he stared at tony and poked a nail at his moustache tony pointed a stiff index finger at him folded the other three fingers tight to his palm and flicked his thumb up and down on the stiff finger the clerk touched the other side of his moustache and looked bored tony went on past the closed and darkened newsstand and the side entrance to the drugstore out to the brassbound plateglass doors he stopped just inside them and took a deep hard breath he squared his shoulders pushed the doors open and stepped out into the cold damp night air the street was dark silent the rumble of traffic on wilshire two blocks away had no body no meaning to the left were two taxis their drivers leaned against a fender side by side smoking tony walked the other way the big dark car was a third of a block from the hotel entrance its lights were dimmed and it was only when he was almost up to it that he heard the gentle sound of its engine turning over a tall figure detached itself from the body of the car and strolled toward him both hands in the pockets of the dark overcoat with the high collar from the mans mouth a cigarette tip glowed faintly a rusty pearl they stopped two feet from each other the tall man said hi tony long time no see hello al hows it going cant complain the tall man started to take his right hand out of his overcoat pocket then stopped and laughed quietly i forgot guess you dont want to shake hands that dont mean anything tony said shaking hands monkeys can shake hands whats on your mind al still the funny little fat guy eh tony i guess tony winked his eyes tight his throat felt tight you like your job back there its a job al laughed his quiet laugh again you take it slow tony ill take it fast so its a job and you want to hold it okay theres a girl named eve cressy flopping in your quiet hotel get her out fast and right now whats the trouble the tall man looked up and down the street a man behind in the car coughed lightly shes hooked with a wrong number nothing against her personal but shell lead trouble to you get her out tony you got maybe an hour sure tony said aimlessly without meaning al took his hand out of his pocket and stretched it against tonys chest he gave him a light lazy push i wouldnt be telling you just for the hell of it little fat brother get her out of there okay tony said without any tone in his voice the tall man took back his hand and reached for the car door he opened it and started to slip in like a lean black shadow then he stopped and said something to the men in the car and got out again he came back to where tony stood silent his pale eyes catching a little dim light from the street listen tony you always kept your nose clean youre a good brother tony tony didnt speak al leaned toward him a long urgent shadow the high collar almost touching his ears its trouble business tony the boys wont like it but im telling you just the same this cressy was married to a lad named johnny rails rails is out of quentin two three days or a week he did a threespot for manslaughter the girl put him there he ran down an old man one night when he was drunk and she was with him he wouldnt stop she told him to go in and tell it or else he didnt go in so the johns come for him tony said thats too bad its kosher kid its my business to know this rails flapped his mouth in stir about how the girl would be waiting for him when he got out all set to forgive and forget and he was going straight to her tony said whats he to you his voice had a dry stiff crackle like thick paper al laughed the trouble boys want to see him he ran a table at a spot on the strip and figured out a scheme he and another guy took the house for fifty grand the other lad coughed up but we still need johnnys twentyfive the trouble boys dont get paid to forget tony looked up and down the dark street one of the taxi drivers flicked a cigarette stub in a long arc over the top of one of the cabs tony watched it fall and spark on the pavement he listened to the quiet sound of the big cars motor i dont want any part of it he said ill get her out al backed away from him nodding wise kid hows mom these days okay tony said tell her i was asking for her asking for her isnt anything tony said al turned quickly and got into the car the car curved lazily in the middle of the block and drifted back toward the corner its lights went up and sprayed on a wall it turned a corner and was gone the lingering smell of its exhaust drifted past tonys nose he turned and walked back to the hotel and into it he went along to the radio room the radio still muttered but the girl was gone from the davenport in front of it the pressed cushions were hollowed out by her body tony reached down and touched them he thought they were still warm he turned the radio off and stood there turning a thumb slowly in front of his body his hand flat against his stomach then he went back through the lobby toward the elevator bank and stood beside a majolica jar of white sand the clerk fussed behind a pebbledglass screen at one end of the desk the air was dead the elevator bank was dark tony looked at the indicator of the middle car and saw that it was at gone to bed he said under his breath the door of the porters room beside the elevators opened and the little mexican night operator came out in street clothes he looked at tony with a quiet sidewise look out of eyes the colour of driedout chestnuts good night boss yeah tony said absently he took a thin dappled cigar out of his vest pocket and smelled it he examined it slowly turning it around in his neat fingers there was a small tear along the side he frowned at that and put the cigar away there was a distant sound and the hand on the indicator began to steal around the bronze dial light glittered up in the shaft and the straight line of the car floor dissolved the darkness below the car stopped and the doors opened and carl came out of it his eyes caught tonys with a kind of jump and he walked over to him his head on one side a thin shine along his pink upper lip listen tony tony took his arm in a hard swift hand and turned him he pushed him quickly yet somehow casually down the steps to the dim main lobby and steered him into a corner he let go of the arm his throat tightened again for no reason he could think of well he said darkly listen to what the porter reached into a pocket and hauled out a dollar bill he gimme this he said loosely his glittering eyes looked past tonys shoulder at nothing they winked rapidly ice and ginger ale dont stall tony growled guy in fourteenb the porter said lemme smell your breath the porter leaned toward him obediently liquor tony said harshly he gimme a drink tony looked down at the dollar bill nobodys in fourteenb not on my list he said yeah there is the porter licked his lips and his eyes opened and shut several times tall dark guy all right tony said crossly all right theres a tall dark guy in fourteenb and he gave you a buck and a drink then what gat under his arm carl said and blinked tony smiled but his eyes had taken on the lifeless glitter of thick ice you take miss cressy up to her room carl shook his head gomez i saw her go up get away from me tony said between his teeth and dont accept any more drinks from the guests he didnt move until carl had gone back into his cubbyhole by the elevators and shut the door then he moved silently up the three steps and stood in front of the desk looking at the veined rose marble the onyx pen set the fresh registration card in its leather frame he lifted a hand and smacked it down hard on the marble the clerk popped out from behind the glass screen like a chipmunk coming out of its hole tony took a flimsy out of his breast pocket and spread it on the desk no fourteenb on this he said in a bitter voice the clerk wisped politely at his moustache so sorry you must have been out to supper when he checked in who registered as james watterson san diego the clerk yawned ask for anybody the clerk stopped in the middle of the yawn and looked at the top of tonys head why yes he asked for a swing band why smart fast and funny tony said if you like em that way he wrote on his flimsy and stuffed it back into his pocket im going upstairs and palm doorknobs theres four tower rooms you aint rented yet get up on your toes son youre slipping i made out the clerk drawled and completed his yawn hurry back pop i dont know how ill get through the time you could shave that pink fuzz off your lip tony said and went across to the elevators he opened up a dark one and lit the dome light and shot the car up to fourteen he darkened it again stepped out and closed the doors this lobby was smaller than any other except the one immediately below it it had a single bluepanelled door in each of the walls other than the elevator wall on each door was a gold number and letter with a gold wreath around it tony walked over to a and put his ear to the panel he heard nothing eve cressy might be in bed asleep or in the bathroom or out on the balcony or she might be sitting there in the room a few feet from the door looking at the wall well he wouldnt expect to be able to hear her sit and look at the wall he went over to b and put his ear to that panel this was different there was a sound in there a man coughed it sounded somehow like a solitary cough there were no voices tony pressed the small nacre button beside the door steps came without hurry a thickened voice spoke through the panel tony made no answer no sound the thickened voice repeated the question lightly maliciously tony pressed the bell again mr james watterson of san diego should now open the door and give forth noise he didnt a silence fell beyond that door that was like the silence of a glacier once more tony put his ear to the wood silence utterly he got out a master key on a chain and pushed it delicately into the lock of the door he turned it pushed the door inward three inches and withdrew the key then he waited all right the voice said harshly come in and get it tony pushed the door wide and stood there framed against the light from the lobby the man was tall blackhaired angular and whitefaced he held a gun he held it as though he knew about guns step right in he drawled tony went in through the door and pushed it shut with his shoulder he kept his hands a little out from his sides the clever fingers curled and slack he smiled his quiet little smile mr watterson and after that what im the house detective here it slays me the tall whitefaced somehow handsome and somehow not handsome man backed slowly into the room it was a large room with a low balcony around two sides of it french doors opened out on the little private openair balcony that each of the tower rooms had there was a grate set for a log fire behind a panelled screen in front of a cheerful davenport a tall misted glass stood on a hotel tray beside a deep cozy chair the man backed toward this and stood in front of it the large glistening gun drooped and pointed at the floor it slays me he said im in the dump an hour and the house copper gives me the bus okay sweetheart look in the closet and bathroom but she just left you didnt see her yet tony said the mans bleached face filled with unexpected lines his thickened voice edged toward a snarl yeah who didnt i see yet a girl named eve cressy the man swallowed he put his gun down on the table beside the tray he let himself down into the chair backwards stiffly like a man with a touch of lumbago then he leaned forward and put his hands on his kneecaps and smiled brightly between his teeth so she got here huh i didnt ask about her yet im a careful guy i didnt ask yet shes been here five days tony said waiting for you she hasnt left the hotel a minute the mans mouth worked a little his smile had a knowing tilt to it i got delayed a little up north he said smoothly you know how it is visiting old friends you seem to know a lot about my business copper thats right mr rails the man lunged to his feet and his hand snapped at the gun he stood leaning over holding it on the table staring dames talk too much he said with a muffled sound in his voice as though he held something soft between his teeth and talked through it not dames mr rails huh the gun slithered on the hard wood of the table talk it up copper my mind reader just quit not dames guys guys with guns the glacier silence fell between them again the man straightened his body out slowly his face was washed clean of expression but his eyes were haunted tony leaned in front of him a shortish plump man with a quiet pale friendly face and eyes as simple as forest water they never run out of gasthose boys johnny rails said and licked at his lip early and late they work the old firm never sleeps you know who they are tony said softly i could maybe give nine guesses and twelve of them would be right the trouble boys tony said and smiled a brittle smile where is she johnny rails asked harshly right next door to you the man walked to the wall and left his gun lying on the table he stood in front of the wall studying it he reached up and gripped the grillwork of the balcony railing when he dropped his hand and turned his face had lost some of its lines his eyes had a quieter glint he moved back to tony and stood over him ive got a stake he said eve sent me some dough and i built it up with a touch i made up north case dough what i mean the trouble boys talk about twentyfive grand he smiled crookedly five cs i can count id have a lot of fun making them believe that i would what did you do with it tony asked indifferently i never had it copper leave that lay im the only guy in the world that believes it it was a little deal that i got suckered on ill believe it tony said they dont kill often but they can be awful tough mugs tony said with a sudden bitter contempt guys with guns just mugs johnny rails reached for his glass and drained it empty the ice cubes tinkled softly as he put it down he picked his gun up danced it on his palm then tucked it nose down into an inner breast pocket he stared at the carpet how come youre telling me this copper i thought maybe youd give her a break and if i wouldnt i kind of think you will tony said johnny rails nodded quietly can i get out of here you could take the service elevator to the garage you could rent a car i can give you a card to the garage man youre a funny little guy johnny rails said tony took out a worn ostrichskin billfold and scribbled on a printed card johnny rails read it and stood holding it tapping it against a thumbnail i could take her with me he said his eyes narrow you could take a ride in a basket too tony said shes been here five days i told you shes been spotted a guy i know called me up and told me to get her out of here told me what it was all about so im getting you out instead theyll love that johnny rails said theyll send you violets ill weep about it on my day off johnny rails turned his hand over and stared at the palm i could see her anyway before i blow next door to here you said tony turned on his heel and started for the door he said over his shoulder dont waste a lot of time handsome i might change my mind the man said almost gently you might be spotting me right now for all i know tony didnt turn his head thats a chance you have to take he went on to the door and passed out of the room he shut it carefully silently looked once at the door of a and got into his dark elevator he rode it down to the linenroom floor and got out to remove the basket that held the service elevator open at that floor the door slid quietly shut he held it so that it made no noise down the corridor light came from the open door of the housekeepers office tony got back into his elevator and went on down to the lobby the little clerk was out of sight behind his pebbledglass screen auditing accounts tony went through the main lobby and turned into the radio room the radio was on again soft she was there curled on the davenport again the speaker hummed to her a vague sound so low that what it said was as wordless as the murmur of trees she turned her head slowly and smiled at him finished palming doorknobs i couldnt sleep worth a nickel so i came down again okay he smiled and nodded he sat down in a green chair and patted the plump brocade arms of it sure miss cressy waiting is the hardest kind of work isnt it i wish youd talk to that radio it sounds like a pretzel being bent tony fiddled with it got nothing he liked set it back where it had been beerparlour drunks are all the customers now she smiled at him again i dont bother you being here miss cressy i like it youre a sweet little guy tony he looked stiffly at the floor and a ripple touched his spine he waited for it to go away it went slowly then he sat back relaxed again his neat fingers clasped on his elks tooth he listened not to the radioto faroff uncertain things menacing things and perhaps to just the safe whir of wheels going away into a strange night nobodys all bad he said out loud the girl looked at him lazily ive met two or three i was wrong on then he nodded yeah he admitted judiciously i guess theres some that are the girl yawned and her deep violet eyes half closed she nestled back into the cushions sit there for a while tony maybe i could nap sure not a thing for me to do dont know why they pay me she slept quickly and with complete stillness like a child tony hardly breathed for ten minutes he just watched her his mouth a little open there was a quiet fascination in his limpid eyes as if he was looking at an altar then he stood up with infinite care and padded away under the arch to the entrance lobby and the desk he stood at the desk listening for a little while he heard a pen rustling out of sight he went around the corner to the row of house phones in little glass cubbyholes he lifted one and asked the night operator for the garage it rang three or four times and then a boyish voice answered windermere hotel garage speaking this is tony reseck that guy watterson i gave a card to he leave sure tony half an hour almost is it your charge yeah tony said my party thanks be seein you he hung up and scratched his neck he went back to the desk and slapped a hand on it the clerk wafted himself around the screen with his greeters smile in place it dropped when he saw tony cant a guy catch up on his work he grumbled whats the professional rate on fourteenb the clerk stared morosely theres no professional rate in the tower make one the fellow left already was there only an hour well well the clerk said airily so the personality didnt click tonight we get a skipout will five bucks satisfy you friend of yours no just a drunk with delusions of grandeur and no dough guess well have to let it ride tony how did he get out i took him down the service elevator you was asleep will five bucks satisfy you why the worn ostrichskin wallet came out and a weedy five slipped across the marble all i could shake him for tony said loosely the clerk took the five and looked puzzled youre the boss he said and shrugged the phone shrilled on the desk and he reached for it he listened and then pushed it toward tony for you tony took the phone and cuddled it close to his chest he put his mouth close to the transmitter the voice was strange to him it had a metallic sound its syllables were meticulously anonymous tony tony reseck talking a message frorra shoot tony looked at the clerk be a pal he said over the mouthpiece the clerk flicked a narrow smile at him and went away shoot tony said into the phone we had a little business with a guy in your place picked him up scramming al had a hunch youd run him out tailed him and took him to the curb not so good backfire tony held the phone very tight and his temples chilled with the evaporation of moisture go on he said i guess theres more a little the guy stopped the big one cold alal said to tell you goodbye tony leaned hard against the desk his mouth made a sound that was not speech get it the metallic voice sounded impatient a little bored this guy had him a rod he used it al wont be phoning anybody any more tony lurched at the phone and the base of it shook on the rose marble his mouth was a hard dry knot the voice said thats as far as we go bub gnight the phone clicked dryly like a pebble hitting a wall tony put the phone down in its cradle very carefully so as not to make any sound he looked at the clenched palm of his left hand he took a handkerchief out and rubbed the palm softly and straightened the fingers out with his other hand then he wiped his forehead the clerk came around the screen again and looked at him with glinting eyes im off friday how about lending me that phone number tony nodded at the clerk and smiled a minute frail smile he put his handkerchief away and patted the pocket he had put it in he turned and walked away from the desk across the entrance lobby down the three shallow steps along the shadowy reaches of the main lobby and so in through the arch to the radio room once more he walked softly like a man moving in a room where somebody is very sick he reached the chair he had sat in before and lowered himself into it inch by inch the girl slept on motionless in that curledup looseness achieved by some women and all cats her breath made no slightest sound against the vague murmur of the radio tony reseck leaned back in the chair and clasped his hands on his elks tooth and quietly closed his eyes john dickson carr it seems fitting that the author most memorable as the creator of lockedroom puzzles set largely in uppercrust and often british milieus should also be a political conservative since john dickson carr spent his writing life being more english than the english it is not surprising that many readers are surprised to learn that carr was american if one can call an american a tory john dickson carr deserves the title born into a prominent pennsylvania family his father was a united states congressman he attended prep school and exclusive haverford college before completing his education in paris after marrying an englishwoman in he lived in great britain writing an average of four novels a year plus radio dramas for the british broadcasting corporation his draft board called him back to the united states in but he was sent back to london to continue writing propaganda for the bbc after the war he moved back to the united states whenever the labour party held power in britain carr produced seventy novels most of them falling within three series his major series characters include henri bencolin an elegant parisian juge dinstruction whose adventures are narrated by jeff marie a young american in paris another of carrs series sleuths is dr gideon fell an obese and omniscient sleuth who works on english shores sometimes along parallel lines of investigation with chief inspector david hadley of scotland yard using the pseudonym carter dickson he created sir henry merrivale another highly intelligent character whose legal and medical expertise is put to good use in investigating seemingly impossible crimes inspector humphrey masters often investigates alongside merrivale among carrs historical mysteries is the hungry goblin featuring wilkie collins as a sleuth and he wrote an authorised biography life of sir arthur conan doyle he also collaborated with adrian conan doyle on a pastiche the exploits of sherlock holmes an examination of carrs fiction proves that he possessed a great sense of play within a form that requires considerable structure and adherence to rules of fair play and careful clueing many of carrs lockedroom mysteries deliver comedy atmosphere and bizarre twists that are rarely surpassed in the genre in he was named grand master by the mystery writers of america written under the carter dickson name the footprint in the sky is a prime example of straightforward narration and a neatly tied ending in sharp contrast with the nearly unbelievable events and unlikely clues that the sleuth must interpret colonel march of the department of queer complaints is called in to provide a surprising solution to what appears to be an openandshut case march appears in nine stories written under the carter dickson pen name originally collected in the department of queer complaints the footprint in the sky she awoke out of confused dreams awoke with a start and lay staring at the white ceiling of her bedroom for a minute or two before she could convince herself it was anything but a dream but it was a dream the cold brittle sunlight poured in at the open window the cold brittle air blowing the curtains stirred a light coating of snow on the windowsill it stirred briskly in that little bare room it should have set the blood racing and dorothy brant breathed it deeply everything was all right she was at the country cottage where she and dad and harry had come down for the skating on the frozen lake possibly even a little mild skiing if the snow came on according to the weather forecast and the snow had fallen she should have been glad of that though for some reason the sight of it on the windowsill struck her with a kind of terror shivering in the warm bed the clothes pulled up about her chin she looked at the little clock on her bedside twenty minutes past nine she had overslept dad and harry would be wanting their breakfast again she told herself that everything was all right though now fully awake she knew it was not the unpleasantness of yesterday returned mrs topham next doorthat old shrew and thief as well it was the only thing which could have marred this weekend they had looked forward to the skating the crisp blades thudding and ringing on the ice the flight the long scratching drag as you turned the elmtrees black against a clear cold sky but there was mrs topham with her stolen watch and her malicious good manners huddled up in the cottage next door and spoiling everything put it out of your mind no good brooding over it put it out of your mind dorothy brant braced herself and got out of bed reaching for her dressinggown and slippers but it was not her dressinggown she found draped across the chair it was her heavy fur coat and there were a pair of softleather slippers they were a pair of softleather moccasins ornamented with beadwork which harry had brought her back from the states but now the undersides were cold damp and stiff almost frozen that was when a subconscious fear struck at her took possession and would not leave closing the window she padded out to the bathroom the small cottage with its crisp white curtains and smell of old wood was so quiet that she could hear voices talking downstairs it was a mumble in which no words were distinguishable harrys quick tenor her fathers slower and heavier voice and another she could not identify but which was slowest and heaviest of all what was wrong she hurried through her bath and through her dressing not only were they up but they must be getting their own breakfast for she could smell coffee boiling and she was very slow in spite of nine hours sleep she felt as edgy and washedout as though she had been up all night giving a last jerk of the comb through her brown bobbed hair putting on no powder or lipstick she ran downstairs at the door of the livingroom she stopped abruptly inside were her father her cousin harry and the local superintendent of police good morning miss said the superintendent she never forgot the look of that little room or the look on the faces of those in it sunlight poured into it touching the brightcoloured roughwoven rugs the rough stone fireplace through side windows she could see out across the snowcovered lawn to wheretwenty yards away and separated from them only by a tall laurel hedge with a gatewaywas mrs tophams white weatherboarded cottage but what struck her with a shock of alarm as she came into the room was the sense of a conversation suddenly cut off the look she surprised on their faces when they glanced round quick and sallow as a camera might have surprised it good morning miss repeated superintendent mason saluting harry ventnor intervened in a kind of agony his naturally high colour was higher still even his large feet and bulky shoulders his small sinewy hands looked agitated dont say anything dolly he urged dont say anything they cant make you say anything wait until i certainly think began her father slowly he looked down his nose and then along the side of his pipe everywhere except at dorothy i certainly think he went on clearing his throat that it would be as well not to speak hastily until if you please sir said superintendent mason clearing his throat now miss im afraid i must ask you some questions but it is my duty to tell you that you need not answer my questions until you have seen your solicitor solicitor but i dont want a solicitor what on earth should i want with a solicitor superintendent mason looked meaningly at her father and harry ventnor as though bidding them to mark that its about mrs topham miss oh why do you say oh go on please what is it i understand miss that you and mrs topham had words yesterday a bit of a dustup like yes you could certainly call it that may i ask what about im sorry said dorothy i cant tell you that it would only give the old cat an opportunity to say i had been slandering her so thats it what has she been telling you why miss said superintendent mason taking out a pencil and scratching the side of his jaw with it im afraid shes not exactly in a condition to tell us anything shes in a nursinghome at guildford rather badly smashed up round the head just between ourselves its touch and go whether shell recover first dorothy could not feel her heart beating at all and then it seemed to pound with enormous rhythm the superintendent was looking at her steadily she forced herself to say you mean shes had an accident not exactly miss the doctor says she was hit three or four times with that big glass paperweight you may have seen on the table at her cottage eh you dont meanyou dont mean somebody did it deliberately but who did it well miss said superintendent mason looking at her still harder until he became a huge puritan face with a small mole beside his nose im bound to tell you that by everything we can see so far it looks as though you did it this wasnt happening it couldnt be she afterwards remembered in a detached kind of way studying all of them the little lines round harrys eyes in the sunlight the hastily brushed light hair the loose leather windjacket whose zip fastener was half undone she remembered thinking that despite his athletic prowess he looked ineffectual and a little foolish but then her own father was not of much use now she heard her own voice but thats absurd i hope so miss i honestly hope so now tell me were you out of this house last night when at any time yes no i dont know yes i think i was for gods sake dolly said her father dont say anything more until weve got a lawyer here ive telephoned to town i didnt want to alarm you i didnt even wake you theres some explanation of this there must be it was not her own emotion it was the wretchedness of his face which held her bulky semibald worried about business worried about everything else in this world that was john brant his crippled left arm and black glove were pressed against his side he stood in the bright pool of sunlight a face of misery iveseen her he explained it wasnt pretty that wasnt not that i havent seen worse in the war he touched his arm but youre a little girl dolly youre only a little girl you couldnt have done that his plaintive tone asked for confirmation just one moment sir interposed superintendent mason now miss you tell me you were outside the house last night yes in the snow yes yes yes do you remember the time no i dont think so tell me miss what size shoes do you wear four thats a rather small size isnt it when she nodded dumbly superintendent mason shut up his notebook now if youll just come with me the cottage had a side door without putting his fingers on the knob mason twisted the spindle round and opened it the overhang of the eaves had kept clear the two steps leading down but beyond a thin coating of snow lay like a plaster over the world between here and the shuttered cottage across the way there were two strings of footprints in that snow dorothy knew whose they were hardened and sharpprinted one set of prints moved out snakily from the steps passed under the arch of the powdered laurelhedge and stopped at the steps to the side door of mrs tophams house another set of the same tracksa little blurred spaced at longer intervals where the person had evidently been running desperatelycame back from the cottage to these steps that mute sign of panic stirred dorothys memory it wasnt a dream she had done it subconsciously she had known it all the time she could remember other things the fur coat clasped round her pyjamas the sting of the snow to wet slippers the blind rush in the dark yours miss inquired superintendent mason yes oh yes theyre mine easy miss muttered the superintendent youre looking a bit white round the gills come in here and sit down i wont hurt you then his own tone grew petulant or perhaps something in the heavy simplicity of the girls manner penetrated his official bearing but why did you do it miss lord why did you do it thats to say breaking open that desk of hers to get a handful of trinkets not worth ten quid for the lot and then not even taking the trouble to mess up your footprints afterwards he coughed checking himself abruptly john brants voice was acid good my friend very good the first sign of intelligence so far i presume you dont suggest my daughter is insane no sir but they were her mothers trinkets i hear where did you hear that you i suppose harry harry ventnor pulled up the zip fastener of his windjacket as though girding himself he seemed to suggest that he was the good fellow whom everybody was persecuting that he wanted to be friends with the world if they would only let him yet such sincerity blazed in his small features that it was difficult to doubt his good intentions now look here dad old boy i had to tell them didnt i its no good trying to hide things like that i know that just from reading those stories stories all right say what you like they always find out and then they make it worse than it really was he let this sink in i tell you youre going about it in the wrong way suppose dolly did have a row with the topham about that jewellery suppose she did go over there last night suppose those are her footprints does that prove she bashed the topham not that a public service wasnt done but why couldnt it have been a burglar just as well superintendent mason shook his head because it couldnt sir but why im asking you why theres no harm in telling you that sir if youll just listen you probably remember that it began to snow last night at a little past eleven oclock no i dont we were all in bed by then well you can take my word for it mason told him patiently i was up half the night at the police station and it did it stopped snowing about midnight youll have to take my word for that too but we can easily prove it you see sir mrs topham was alive and in very good health at well after midnight i know that too because she rang up the police station and said she was awake and nervous and thought there were burglars in the neighbourhood since the lady does that same thing he explained with a certain grimness on the average of about three times a month i dont stress that what i am telling you is that her call came in at at least ten minutes after the snow had stopped harry hesitated and the superintendent went on with the same patient air dont you see it sir mrs topham wasnt attacked until after the snow stopped round her cottage now theres twenty yards of clean clear unmarked snow in every direction the only marks in that snow the only marks of any kind at all are the footprints miss brant admits she made herself then he rose at them in exasperation tisnt as though anybody else could have made the tracks even if miss brant didnt admit it herself im absolutely certain nobody else did you mr ventnor wear size ten shoes mr brant wears size nine walk in size four tracks ayagh and yet somebody did get into the cottage with a key bashed the old lady pretty murderously robbed her desk and got away again if there are no other tracks or marks of any kind in the snow who did it who must have done it dorothy could consider it now in almost a detached way she remembered the paperweight with which mrs topham had been struck it lay on the table in mrs tophams stuffy parlour a heavy glass globe with a tiny landscape inside when you shook the glass globe a miniature snowstorm rose withinwhich seemed to make the attack more horrible she wondered if she had left any fingerprints on it but over everything rose renee tophams face renee topham her mothers bosom friend i hated her said dorothy and unexpectedly she began to cry dennis jameson of the lawfirm of morris farnsworth jameson lincoln s inn fields shut up his briefcase with a snap he was putting on his hat and coat when billy farnsworth looked into the office hullo said farnsworth you off to surrey over that brant business yes hm believe in miracles do you no that girls guilty my lad you ought to know that its our business said jameson to do what we can for our clients farnsworth looked at him shrewdly i see it in your ruddy cheek quixotry is alive again young idealist storms to relief of goodlooker in distress swearing to ive met her twice said jameson i like her yes but merely using a small amount of intelligence on this i cant see that theyve got such a thundering good case against her oh my lad well look at it what do they say the girl did this mrs topham was struck several times with a glass paperweight there are no fingerprints on the paperweight which shows signs of having been wiped but after having the forethought to wipe her fingerprints carefully off the paperweight dorothy brant then walks back to her cottage and leaves behind two sets of footprints which could be seen by aerial observation a mile up is that reasonable farnsworth looked thoughtful maybe they would say she isnt reasonable he pointed out never mind the psychology what youve got to get round are the physical facts here is the mysterious widow topham entirely alone in the house the only servant comes in by day here are one persons footprints only that girl could have made the tracks and in fact admits she did its a physical impossibility for anybody else to have entered or left the house how do you propose to get round that i dont know said jameson rather hopelessly but i want to hear her side of it first the only thing nobody seems to have heard or even to be curious about is what she thinks herself yet when he met her at the cottage late that afternoon she cut the ground from under his feet twilight was coming down when he turned in at the gate a bluish twilight in which the snow looked grey jameson stopped a moment at the gate and stared across at the thin laurelhedge dividing this property from mrs tophams there was nothing remarkable about this hedge which was some six feet high and cut through by a gateway like a gothic arch but in front of the arch peering up at the snowcoated side of the hedge just above it stood a large figure in cap and waterproof somehow he looked familiar at his elbow another man evidently the local superintendent of police was holding up a camera and a flashbulb glared against the sky though he was too far away to hear anything jameson had a queer impression that the large man was laughing uproariously harry ventnor whom he knew slightly met jameson at the door shes in there harry explained nodding towards the front room erdont upset her will you here what the devil are they doing with that hedge he stared across the lawn upset her said jameson with some asperity im here if possible to help her wont you or mr brant give some assistance do you honestly think that miss brant in her rational senses could have done what they say she did in her rational senses repeated harry after looking at jameson in a curious way he said no more he turned abruptly and hurried off across the lawn yet dorothy when jameson met her gave no impression of being out of her rational senses it was her straightforwardness he had always liked the straightforwardness which warmed him now they sat in the homely firelit room by the fireplace over which were the silver cups to denote harrys athletic and gymnastic prowess and the trophies of john brants earlier days at st moritz dorothy herself was an outdoor girl to advise me she said you mean to advise me what to say when they arrest me well they havent arrested you yet miss brant she smiled at him and yet ill bet that surprises you doesnt it oh i know how deeply im in i suppose theyre only poking about to get more evidence and then theres a new man here a man named march from scotland yard i feel almost flattered jameson sat up he knew now why that immense figure by the hedge had seemed familiar not colonel march yes rather a nice person really answered dorothy shading her eyes with her hand under her light tone he felt that her nerves were raw then again theyve been all through my room and they cant find the watch and the brooch and the rings im supposed to have stolen from aunt renee topham aunt renée so ive heard but thats the point what are they getting at a watch and a brooch and a couple of rings why should you steal that from anybody let alone her because they werent hers said dorothy suddenly looking up with a white face and speaking very fast they belonged to my mother steady my mother is dead said dorothy i suppose it wasnt just the watch and the rings really that was the excuse the breakingpoint the thing that brought it on my mother was a great friend of mrs topham it was aunt renée this and aunt renée that while my mother was alive to pamper her but my mother wanted me to have those trinkets such as they were and aunt renée topham coolly appropriated them as she appropriates everything else she can i never knew what had happened to them until yesterday do you know that kind of woman mrs topham is really charming aristocratic and charming with the cool charm that takes all it can get and expects to go on getting it i know for a fact that shes really got a lot of money though what she does with it i cant imagine and the real reason why she buries herself in the country is that shes too mean to risk spending it in town i never could endure her then when my mother died and i didnt go on pampering aunt renée as she thought i should it was a very different thing how that woman loves to talk about us harrys debts and my fathers shaky business and me she checked herself again smiling at him im sorry to inflict all this on you youre not inflicting anything on me but its rather ridiculous isnt it ridiculous said jameson grimly is not the word i should apply to it so you had a row with her oh a glorious row a beautiful row the grandmother of all rows when yesterday when i saw her wearing my mothers watch she looked at the fire over which the silver cups glimmered maybe i said more than i should have she went on but i got no support from my father or harry i dont blame dad hes so worried about business and that bad arm of his troubles him so much sometimes that all he wants is peace and quiet as for harry he doesnt really like her but she took rather a fancy to him and that flatters him hes a kind of male counterpart of aunt renée out of a jobwell depend on somebody else and im in the middle of all this its dolly do this and dolly do that and good old dolly she wont mind but i do mind when i saw that woman standing there wearing my mothers watch and saying commiserating things about the fact that we couldnt afford a servant i felt that something ought to be done about it so i suppose i must have done something about it jameson reached out and took her hands all right he said did you do it i dont know thats just the trouble but surely no that was one of the things mrs topham always had such sport with you dont know much about anything when you walk in your sleep ridiculous isnt it she went on after another pause utterly ludicrous but not to me not a bit ever since i was a child when ive been overtired or nervously exhausted its happened once i came downstairs and built and lit a fire in the diningroom and set the table for a meal i admit it doesnt happen often and never before with results like this she tried to laugh but why do you think my father and harry looked at me like that thats the worst of it i really dont know whether im a nearmurderer or not this was bad jameson admitted that to himself even as his reason argued against it he got up to prowl round the room and her brown eyes never left him he could not look away he saw the tensity of her face in every corner look here he said quietly this is nonsense oh please dont you say that its not very original but do you seriously think you went for that woman and still dont know anything about it now would it be more difficult than building a fire i dont ask you that do you think you did it no said dorothy that question did it she trusted him now there was understanding and sympathy between them a mental force and communication that could be felt as palpably as the body gives out heat deep down inside me no i dont believe it i think i should have waked up and there was nowell no blood on me you know but how are you going to get round the evidence the evidence always the evidence i did go across there i cant deny that i remember half waking up as i was coming back i was standing in the middle of the lawn in the snow i had on my fur coat over my pyjamas i remember feeling snow on my face and my wet slippers under me i was shivering and i remember running back thats all if i didnt do it how could anybody else have done it i beg your pardon interposed a new voice do you mind if both figuratively and literally i turn on the light dennis jameson knew the owner of that voice there was the noise of someone fumbling after an electric switch then in homely light colonel march beamed and basked colonel marchs seventeen stone was swathed round in a waterproof as big as a tent he wore a large tweed cap under this his speckled face glowed in the cold and he was smoking with gurgling relish the largebowled pipe which threatened to singe his sandy moustache ah jameson he said he took the pipe out of his mouth and made a gesture with it so it was you i thought i saw you come in i dont want to intrude but i think there are at least two things that miss brant ought to know dorothy turned round quickly first pursued colonel march that mrs topham is out of danger she is at least able like an afterdinner speaker to say a few words though with about as much coherence second that out on your lawn there is one of the queerest objects i ever saw in my life jameson whistled youve met this fellow he said to dorothy he is the head of the queer complaints department when they come across something outlandish which may be a hoax or a joke but on the other hand may be a serious crime they shout for him his mind is so obvious that he hits it every time to my certain knowledge he has investigated a disappearing room chased a walking corpse and found an invisible piece of furniture if he goes so far as to admit that a thing is a bit unusual you can look out for squalls colonel march nodded quite seriously yes he said that is why i am here you see they thought we might be interested in that footprint that footprint cried dorothy you mean no no not your footprint miss brant another one let me explain i want you both of you to look out of that window i want you to take a look at the laurelhedge between this cottage and the other the light is almost gone but study it jameson went to the window and peered out well he demanded what about it its a hedge as you so shrewdly note it is a hedge now let me ask you a question do you think a person could walk along the top of that hedge good lord no no why not i dont see the joke said jameson but ill make the proper replies because the hedge is only an inch or two thick it wouldnt support a cat if you tried to stand on it youd come through like a ton of bricks quite true then what would you say if i told you that someone weighing at least twelve stone must have climbed up the side of it nobody answered him the thing was so obviously unreasonable that nobody could answer dorothy brant and dennis jameson looked at each other for said colonel march it would seem that somebody at least climbed up there look at the hedge again you see the arch cut in it for a gate just above that in the snow along the side of the hedge there are traces of a footprint it is a large footprint i think it can be identified by the heel though most of it is blurred and sketchy walking quickly and heavily dorothys father came into the room he started to speak but seemed to change his mind at the sight of colonel march he went over to dorothy who took his arm then insisted jameson somebody did climb up on the hedge i doubt it said colonel march how could he jameson pulled himself together look here sir he said quietly how could he is correct i never knew you to go on like this without good reason i know it must have some bearing on the case but i dont care if somebody climbed up on the hedge i dont care if he danced the big apple on it the hedge leads nowhere it doesnt lead to mrs tophams it only divides the two properties the point is how did somebody manage to get from here to that other cottageacross sixty feet of unbroken snowwithout leaving a trace on it i ask you that because im certain you dont think miss brant is guilty colonel march looked apologetic i know she isnt he answered in dorothy brants mind was again that vision of the heavy globed paperweight inside which as you shook it a miniature snowstorm arose she felt that her own wits were being shaken and clouded in the same way i knew dolly didnt do it said john brant suddenly putting his arm round his daughters shoulder i knew that i told them so but colonel march silenced him the real thief miss brant did not want your mothers watch and brooch and chain and rings it may interest you to know what he did want he wanted about fifteen hundred pounds of notes and gold sovereigns tucked away in that same shabby desk you seem to have wondered what mrs topham did with her money that is what she did with it mrs topham by the first words she could get out in semiconsciousness was merely a common or garden variety of miser that dulllooking desk in her parlour was the last place any burglar would look for a hoard any burglar that is except one except one repeated john brant and his eyes seemed to turn inwards a sudden ugly suspicion came to jameson except one who knew yes you miss brant had the blame deliberately put on you there was no malice in it it was simply the easiest way to avoid pain and trouble to the gentleman who did it now hear what you really did said colonel march his face darkening you did go out into the snow last night but you did not go over to mrs tophams and you did not make those two artistic sets of footprints in the snow when you tell us in your own story that you felt snow sting on your face as well as underfoot it requires no vast concentration surely to realise that the snow was still falling you went out into it like many sleepwalkers you were shocked into semiconsciousness by the snow and the cold air and you returned long before the end of the snowfall which covered any real prints you may have made the real thiefwho was very much awakeheard you come back and tumble into bed he saw a heavensent opportunity to blame you for a crime you might even think you had committed he slipped in and took the slippers out of your room and when the snow had stopped he went across to mrs tophams he did not mean to attack her but she was awake and surprised him and so of course harry ventnor struck her down harry the word which dorothy had said almost at a scream was checked she looked round quickly at her father she stared straight ahead and then she began to laugh of course said colonel march as usual he was letting his what is it his good old dolly take the blame a great cloud seemed to have left john brant but the fussed and worried look had not left him he blinked at colonel march sir he said i would give my good arm to prove what you say that boy has caused me half the trouble i ever had but are you raving mad no i tell you he couldnt have done it hes emilys son my sisters son he may be a bad lot but hes not a magician you are forgetting said colonel march a certain large sizeten footprint you are forgetting that interesting sight a smeared and blurred sizeten footprint on the side of a hedge which would not have held up a cat a remarkable footprint a disembodied footprint but thats the whole trouble roared the other the two lines of tracks in the snow were made by a size four shoe harry couldnt have made them any more than i could its a physical impossibility harry wear size ten you dont say he could get his feet into flat leather moccasins which would fit my daughter no said colonel march but he could get his hands into them there was a silence the colonel wore a dreamy look almost a pleased look and in this unusual but highly practical pair of gloves he went on harry ventnor simply walked across to the other cottage on his hands no more than that for a trained gymnast as those silver cups will indicate it was nothing for a rattlebrained gentleman who needed money it was ideal he crossed in a thin coating of snow which would show no difference in weight doorsteps cleared of snow by the overhanging roof protected him at either end when he stood upright he had endless opportunities to get a key to the side door unfortunately there was that rather low archway in the hedge carrying himself on his hands his feet were curved up and back over the arch of his body to balance him he blundered and smeared that disembodied footprint on the side of the hedge to be quite frank i am delighted with the device it was crime upside down it is leaving a footprint in the sky it is a fair cop sir concluded superintendent mason sticking his head in at the door they got him on the other side of guildford he must have smelled something wrong when he saw us taking photographs but he had the stuff on him dorothy brant stood looking for a long time at the large untidy blimplike man who was still chuckling with pleasure then she joined in i trust observed dennis jameson politely that everybody is having a good time for myself ive had a couple of unpleasant shocks today and just for a moment i was afraid i should have another one for a moment i honestly thought you were going to pitch on mr brant so did i agreed dorothy and beamed at her father thats why its so funny now john brant looked startled but not half so startled as colonel march now there the colonel said i honestly do not understand you i am the department of queer complaints if you have a ghost in your attic or a footprint on top of your hedge ring me up but a certain success has blessed us because as mr jameson says i look for the obvious and lord love usif you have decided that a crime was committed by a gentleman who could walk on his hands i would hold under torture that you are not likely to succeed by suspecting the one person in the house who has a crippled arm cornell woolrich cornell woolrich would have served well as a character in one of his own sombre enigmatic and somehow slightly bent stories which he wrote under the pseudonym william irish born cornell george hopley woolrich this son of a civil engineer father and socialite mother spent part of his boyhood in latin america obtaining a collection of cartridges that mexican revolutionaries had fired at one another and watching his parents marriage fall apart he studied literature and creative writing at columbia university wrote two romantic novels went to hollywood as a scriptwriter and married a film producers daughter his new wife left him in a matter of weeks fuelling speculation that woolrich was homosexual the central woman in his life seems to have been his mother he remained devoted to her until she died in after that he wrote relatively little drank more rarely emerged from his hotel suite and ignored the rapid decline of his health including gangrene until amputation of a leg was needed despite the fame his work had brought him only a handful of mourners attended his funeral the fame was well deserved woolrich imbued detective fiction with a dark and ironic fatalism he used psychology and the strangeness of the human subconscious in new ways filling his pages with the often selfinduced travails of desperate people he possessed a remarkable ability to take an ordinary character into an uneasy and threatening situation and to sustain a dark atmosphere of suspense even in situations where the action is slow and deliberate or observed from a distance he also demonstrated a proclivity for unusual plots if the plot of rear window no longer seems unusual it was highly inventive in woolrichs day rear window was made into an immensely successful movie starring jimmy stewart after which the plot was used and abused by numerous imitators the immobility of the narrator and his sense of foreboding are not uncommon in the authors work woolrichs manipulation of these elements makes this story a prime example of the authors ability to build a threatening air of tension for both the character and the reader rear window i didnt know their names id never heard their voices i didnt even know them by sight strictly speaking for their faces were too small to fill in with identifiable features at that distance yet i could have constructed a timetable of their comings and goings their daily habits and activities they were the rearwindow dwellers around me sure i suppose it was a little bit like prying could even have been mistaken for the fevered concentration of a peeping tom that wasnt my fault that wasnt the idea the idea was my movements were strictly limited just around this time i could get from the window to the bed and from the bed to the window and that was all the bay window was about the best feature my rear bedroom had in the warm weather it was unscreened so i had to sit with the light out or i would have had every insect in the vicinity in on me i couldnt sleep because i was used to getting plenty of exercise id never acquired the habit of reading books to ward off boredom so i hadnt that to turn to well what should i do sit there with my eyes tightly shuttered just to pick a few at random straight over and the windows square there was a young jittercouple kids in their teens only just married it would have killed them to stay home one night they were always in such a hurry to go wherever it was they went they never remembered to turn out the lights i dont think it missed once in all the time i was watching but they never forgot altogether either i was to learn to call this delayed action as you will see hed always come skittering madly back in about five minutes probably from all the way down in the street and rush around killing the switches then fall over something in the dark on his way out they gave me an inward chuckle those two the next house down the windows already narrowed a little with perspective there was a certain light in that one that always went out each night too something about it it used to make me a little sad there was a woman living there with her child a young widow i suppose id see her put the child to bed and then bend over and kiss her in a wistful sort of way shed shade the light off her and sit there painting her eyes and mouth then shed go out shed never come back till the night was nearly spent once i was still up and i looked and she was sitting there motionless with her head buried in her arms something about it it used to make me a little sad the third one down no longer offered any insight the windows were just slits like in a medieval battlement due to foreshortening that brings us around to the one on the end in that one frontal vision came back fulldepth again since it stood at right angles to the rest my own included sealing up the inner hollow all these houses backed on i could see into it from the rounded projection of my bay window as freely as into a doll house with its rear wall sliced away and scaled down to about the same size it was a flat building unlike all the rest it had been constructed originally as such not just cut up into furnished rooms it topped them by two stories and had rear fire escapes to show for this distinction but it was old evidently hadnt shown a profit it was in the process of being modernised instead of clearing the entire building while the work was going on they were doing it a flat at a time in order to lose as little rental income as possible of the six rearward flats it offered to view the topmost one had already been completed but not yet rented they were working on the fifthfloor one now disturbing the peace of everyone all up and down the inside of the block with their hammering and sawing i felt sorry for the couple in the flat below i used to wonder how they stood it with that bedlam going on above their heads to make it worse the wife was in chronic poor health too i could tell that even at a distance by the listless way she moved about over there and remained in her bathrobe without dressing sometimes id see her sitting by the window holding her head i used to wonder why he didnt have a doctor in to look her over but maybe they couldnt afford it he seemed to be out of work often their bedroom light was on late at night behind the drawn shade as though she were unwell and he was sitting up with her and one night in particular he must have had to sit up with her all night it remained on until nearly daybreak not that i sat watching all that time but the light was still burning at three in the morning when i finally transferred from chair to bed to see if i could get a little sleep myself and when i failed to and hopscotched back again around dawn it was still peering wanly out behind the tan shade moments later with the first brightening of day it suddenly dimmed around the edges of the shade and then shortly afterward not that one but a shade in one of the other roomsfor all of them alike had been downwent up and i saw him standing there looking out he was holding a cigarette in his hand i couldnt see it but i could tell it was that by the quick nervous little jerks with which he kept putting his hand to his mouth and the haze i saw rising around his head worried about her i guess i didnt blame him for that any husband would have been she must have only just dropped off to sleep after nightlong suffering and then in another hour or so at the most that sawing of wood and clattering of buckets was going to start in over them again well it wasnt any of my business i said to myself but he really ought to get her out of there if i had an ill wife on my hands he was leaning slightly out maybe an inch past the window frame carefully scanning the back faces of all the houses abutting on the hollow square that lay before him you can tell even at a distance when a person is looking fixedly theres something about the way the head is held and yet his scrutiny wasnt held fixedly to any one point it was a slow sweeping one moving along the houses on the opposite side from me first when it got to the end of them i knew it would cross over to my side and come back along there before it did i withdrew several yards inside my room to let it go safely by i didnt want him to think i was sitting there prying into his affairs there was still enough blue nightshade in my room to keep my slight withdrawal from catching his eye when i returned to my original position a moment or two later he was gone he had raised two more of the shades the bedroom one was still down i wondered vaguely why he had given that peculiar comprehensive semicircular stare at all the rear windows around him there wasnt anyone at any of them at such an hour it wasnt important of course it was just a little oddity it failed to blend in with his being worried or disturbed about his wife when youre worried or disturbed thats an internal preoccupation you stare vacantly at nothing at all when you stare around you in a great sweeping arc at windows that betrays external preoccupation outward interest one doesnt quite jibe with the other to call such a discrepancy trifling is to add to its importance only someone like me stewing in a vacuum of total idleness would have noticed it at all the flat remained lifeless after that as far as could be judged by its windows he must have either gone out or gone to bed himself three of the shades remained at normal height the one masking the bedroom remained down sam my day houseman came in not long after with my eggs and morning paper and i had that to kill time with for awhile i stopped thinking about other peoples windows and staring at them the sun slanted down on one side of the hollow oblong all morning long then it shifted over to the other side for the afternoon then it started to slip off both alike and it was evening againanother day gone the lights started to come on around the quadrangle here and there a wall played back like a sounding board a snatch of radio program that was coming in too loud if you listened carefully you could hear an occasional clink of dishes mixed in faint far off the chain of little habits that were their lives unreeled themselves they were all bound in them tighter than the tightest straitjacket any jailer ever devised though they all thought themselves free the jitterbugs made their nightly dash for the great open spaces forgot their lights he came careening back thumbed them out and their place was dark until the early morning hours the woman put her child to bed leaned mournfully over its cot then sat down with heavy despair to redden her mouth in the fourthfloor flat at right angles to the long interior street the three shades had remained up and the fourth shade had remained at full length all day long i hadnt been conscious of that because i hadnt particularly been looking at it of thinking of it until now my eyes may have rested on those windows at times during the day but my thoughts had been elsewhere it was only when a light suddenly went up in the end room behind one of the raised shades which was their kitchen that i realised that the shades had been untouched like that all day that also brought something else to my mind that hadnt been in it until now i hadnt seen the woman all day i hadnt seen any sign of life within those windows until now hed come in from outside the entrance was at the opposite side of their kitchen away from the window hed left his hat on so i knew hed just come in from the outside he didnt remove his hat as though there was no one there to remove it for any more instead he pushed it farther to the back of his head by pronging a hand to the roots of his hair that gesture didnt denote removal of perspiration i knew to do that a person makes a side wise sweepthis was up over his forehead it indicated some sort of harassment or uncertainty besides if hed been suffering from excess warmth the first thing he would have done would be to take off his hat altogether she didnt come out to greet him the first link of the sostrong chain of habit of custom that binds us all had snapped wide open she must be so ill she had remained in bed in the room behind the lowered shade all day i watched he remained where he was two rooms away from there expectancy became surprise surprise incomprehension funny i thought that he doesnt go in to her or at least go as far as the doorway look in to see how she is maybe she was asleep and he didnt want to disturb her then immediately but how can he know for sure that shes asleep without at least looking in at her he just came in himself he came forward and stood there by the window as he had at dawn sam had carried out my tray quite some time before and my lights were out i held my ground i knew he couldnt see me within the darkness of the bay window he stood there motionless for several minutes and now his attitude was the proper one for inner preoccupation he stood there looking downward at nothing lost in thought hes worried about her i said to myself as any man would be its the most natural thing in the world funny though he should leave her in the dark like that without going near her if hes worried then why didnt he at least look in on her on returning here was another of those trivial discrepancies between inward motivation and outward indication and just as i was thinking that the original one that i had noted at daybreak repeated itself his head went up with renewed alertness and i could see it start to give that slow circular sweep of interrogation around the panorama of rearward windows again true the light was behind him this time but there was enough of it falling on him to show me the microscopic but continuous shift of direction his head made in the process i remained carefully immobile until the distant glance had passed me safely by motion attracts why is he so interested in other peoples windows i wondered detachedly and of course an effective brake to dwelling on that thought too lingeringly clamped down almost at once look whos talking what about you yourself an important difference escaped me i wasnt worried about anything he presumably was down came the shades again the lights stayed on behind their beige opaqueness but behind the one that had remained down all along the room remained dark time went by hard to say how mucha quarter of an hour twenty minutes a cricket chirped in one of the back yards sam came in to see if i wanted anything before he went home for the night i told him no i didntit was all right run along he stood there for a minute head down then i saw him shake it slightly as if at something he didnt like whats the matter i asked you know what that means my old mammy told it to me and she never told me a lie in her life i never once seen it to miss either what the cricket any time you hear one of them things thats a sign of deathsomeplace close around i swept the back of my hand at him well it isnt in here so dont let it worry you he went out muttering stubbornly its somewhere close by though somewhere not very far off got to be the door closed after him and i stayed there alone in the dark it was a stifling night much closer than the one before i could hardly get a breath of air even by the open window at which i sat i wondered how hethat unknown over therecould stand it behind those drawn shades then suddenly just as idle speculation about this whole matter was about to alight on some fixed point in my mind crystallise into something like suspicion up came the shades again and off it flitted as formless as ever and without having had a chance to come to rest on anything he was in the middle windows the living room hed taken off his coat and shirt was barearmed in his undershirt he hadnt been able to stand it himself i guessthe sultriness i couldnt make out what he was doing at first he seemed to be busy in a perpendicular upanddown way rather than lengthwise he remained in one place but he kept dipping down out of sight and then straightening up into view again at irregular intervals it was almost like some sort of callisthenic exercise except that the dips and rises werent evenly timed enough for that sometimes hed stay down a long time sometimes hed bob right up again sometimes hed go down two or three times in rapid succession there was some sort of a widespread black v railing him off from the window whatever it was there was just a sliver of it showing above the upward inclination to which the window sill deflected my line of vision all it did was strike off the bottom of his undershirt to the extent of a sixteenth of an inch maybe but i hadnt seen it there at other times and i couldnt tell what it was suddenly he left it for the first time since the shades had gone up came out around it to the outside stooped down into another part of the room and straightened again with an armful of what looked like varicolored pennants at the distance at which i was he went back behind the v and allowed them to fall across the top of it for a moment and stay that way he made one of his dips down out of sight and stayed that way a good while the pennants slung across the v kept changing colour right in front of my eyes i have very good sight one moment they were white the next red the next blue then i got it they were a womans dresses and he was pulling them down to him one by one taking the topmost one each time suddenly they were all gone the v was black and bare again and his torso had reappeared i knew what it was now and what he was doing the dresses had told me he confirmed it for me he spread his arms to the ends of the v i could see him heave and hitch as if exerting pressure and suddenly the v had folded up become a cubed wedge then he made rolling motions with his whole upper body and the wedge disappeared off to one side hed been packing a trunk packing his wifes things into a large upright trunk he reappeared at the kitchen window presently stood still for a moment i saw him draw his arm across his forehead not once but several times and then whip the end of it off into space sure it was hot work for such a night then he reached up along the wall and took something down since it was the kitchen he was in my imagination had to supply a cabinet and a bottle i could see the two or three quick passes his hand made to his mouth after that i said to myself tolerantly thats what nine men out of ten would do after packing a trunktake a good stiff drink and if the tenth didnt it would only be because he didnt have any liquor at hand then he came closer to the window again and standing edgewise to the side of it so that only a thin paring of his head and shoulder showed peered watchfully out into the dark quadrilateral along the line of windows most of them unlighted by now once more he always started on the lefthand side the side opposite mine and made his circuit of inspection from there on around that was the second time in one evening id seen him do that and once at daybreak made three times altogether i smiled mentally youd almost think he felt guilty about something it was probably nothing just an odd little habit a quirk that he didnt know he had himself i had them myself everyone does he withdrew into the room again and it blacked out his figure passed into the one that was still lighted next to it the living room that blacked next it didnt surprise me that the third room the bedroom with the drawn shade didnt light up on his entering there he wouldnt want to disturb her of courseparticularly if she was going away tomorrow for her health as his packing of her trunk showed she needed all the rest she could get before making the trip simple enough for him to slip into bed in the dark it did surprise me though when a matchflare winked some time later to have it still come from the darkened living room he must be lying down in there trying to sleep on a sofa or something for the night he hadnt gone near the bedroom at all was staying out of it altogether that puzzled me frankly that was carrying solicitude almost too far ten minutes or so later there was another matchwink still from that same living room window he couldnt sleep the night brooded down on both of us alike the curiositymonger in the bay window the chainsmoker in the fourthfloor flat without giving any answer the only sound was that interminable cricket i was back at the window again with the first sun of morning not because of him my mattress was like a bed of hot coals sam found me there when he came in to get things ready for me youre going to be a wreck mr jeff was all he said first for awhile there was no sign of life over there then suddenly i saw his head bob up from somewhere down out of sight in the living room so i knew id been right hed spent the night on a sofa or easy chair in there now of course hed look in at her to see how she was find out if she felt any better that was only common ordinary humanity he hadnt been near her so far as i could make out since two nights before he didnt he dressed and he went in the opposite direction into the kitchen and wolfed something in there standing up and using both hands then he suddenly turned and moved off side in the direction in which i knew the flatentrance to be as if he had just heard some summons like the doorbell sure enough in a moment he came back and there were two men with him in leather aprons expressmen i saw him standing by while they laboriously manoeuvred that cubed black wedge out between them in the direction theyd just come from he did more than just stand by he practically hovered over them kept shifting from side to side he was so anxious to see that it was done right then he came back alone and i saw him swipe his arm across his head as though it was he not they who was all heated up from the effort so he was forwarding her trunk to wherever it was she was going that was all he reached up along the wall again and took something down he was taking another drink two three i said to myself a little at a loss yes but he hasnt just packed a trunk this time that trunk has been standing packed and ready since last night where does the hard work come in the sweat and the need for a bracer now at last after all those hours he finally did go in to her i saw his form pass through the living room and go beyond into the bedroom up went the shade that had been down all this time then he turned his head and looked around behind him in a certain way a way that was unmistakable even from where i was not in one certain direction as one looks at a person but from side to side and up and down and all around as one looks at an empty room he stepped back bent a little gave a fling of his arms and an unoccupied mattress and bedding upended over the foot of a bed stayed that way emptily curved a second one followed a moment later she wasnt in there they use the expression delayed action i found out then what it meant for two days a sort of formless uneasiness a disembodied suspicion i dont know what to call it had been flitting and volplaning around in my mind like an insect looking for a landing place more than once just as it had been ready to settle some slight thing some slight reassuring thing such as the raising of the shades after they had been down unnaturally long had been enough to keep it winging aimlessly prevent it from staying still long enough for me to recognise it the point of contact had been there all along waiting to receive it now for some reason within a split second after he tossed over the empty mattresses it landedzoom and the point of contact expandedor exploded whatever you care to call itinto a certainty of murder in other words the rational part of my mind was far behind the instinctive subconscious part delayed action now the one had caught up to the other the thoughtmessage that sparked from the synchronization was hes done something to her i looked down and my hand was bunching the goods over my kneecap it was knotted so tight i forced it to open i said to myself steadyingly now wait a minute be careful go slow youve seen nothing you know nothing you only have the negative proof that you dont see her any more sam was standing there looking over at me from the pantry way he said accusingly you aint touched a thing and your face looks like a sheet it felt like one it had that needling feeling when the blood has left it involuntarily it was more to get him out of the way and give myself some elbow room for undisturbed thinking than anything else that i said sam whats the street address of that building down there dont stick your head too far out and gape at it somepn or other benedict avenue he scratched his neck helpfully i know that chase around the corner a minute and get me the exact number on it will you why you want to know that for he asked as he turned to go none of your business i said with the goodnatured firmness that is all that was necessary to take care of that once and for all i called after him just as he was closing the door and while youre about it step into the entrance and see if you can tell from the mailboxes who has the fourthfloor rear dont get me the wrong one now and try not to let anyone catch you at it he went out mumbling something that sounded like when a man aint got nothing to do but just sit all day he sure can think up the blamest things the door closed and i settled down to some good constructive thinking i said to myself what are you really building up this monstrous supposition on lets see what youve got only that there were several little things wrong with the mechanism the chainbelt of their recurrent daily habits over there the lights were on all night the first night he came in later than usual the second night he left his hat on she didnt come out to greet himshe hasnt appeared since the evening before the lights were on all night he took a drink after he finished packing her truck but he took three stiff drinks the next morning immediately after her trunk went out he was inwardly disturbed and worried yet superimposed upon this was an unnatural external concern about the surrounding windows that was offkey he slept in the living room didnt go near the bedroom during the night before the departure of the trunk very well if she had been ill that first night and he had sent her away for her health that automatically cancelled out points it left points and totally unimportant and unincriminating but when it came up against it hit a stumbling block if she went away immediately after being ill that first night why didnt he want to sleep in their bedroom last night sentiment hardly two perfectly good beds in one room only a sofa or uncomfortable easy chair in the other why should he stay out of there if she was already gone just because he missed her was lonely a grown man doesnt act that way all right then she was still in there sam came back parenthetically at this point and said that house is number benedict avenue the fourthfloor rear it got the name of mr and mrs lars thorwald up shh i silenced and motioned him backhand out of my ken first he want it then he dont he grumbled philosophically and retired to his duties i went ahead digging at it but if she was still in there in that bedroom last night then she couldnt have gone away to the country because i never saw her leave today she could have left without my seeing her in the early hours of yesterday morning id missed a few hours been asleep but this morning i had been up before he was himself i only saw his head rear up from that sofa after id been at the window for some time to go at all she would have had to go yesterday morning then why had he left the bedroom shade down left the mattresses undisturbed until today above all why had he stayed out of that room last night that was evidence that she hadnt gone was still in there then today immediately after the trunk had been dispatched he went in pulled up the shade tossed over the mattresses and showed that she hadnt been in there the thing was like a crazy spiral no it wasnt either immediately after the trunk had been dispatched the trunk that did it i looked around to make sure the door was safely closed between sam and me my hand hovered uncertainly over the telephone dial a minute boyne hed be the one to tell about it he was on homicide he had been anyway when id last seen him i didnt want to get a flock of strange dicks and cops into my hair i didnt want to be involved any more than i had to or at all if possible they switched my call to the right place after a couple of wrong tries and i got him finally look boyne this is hal jeffries well whereve you been the last sixtytwo years he started to enthuse we can take that up later what i want you to do now is take down a name and address ready lars thorwald five twentyfive benedict avenue fourthfloor rear got it fourthfloor rear got it whats it for investigation ive got a firm belief youll uncover a murder there if you start digging at it dont call on me for anything more than thatjust a conviction theres been a man and wife living there until now now theres just the man her trunk went out early this morning if you can find someone who saw her leave herself marshalled aloud like that and conveyed to somebody else a lieutenant of detectives above all it did sound flimsy even to me he said hesitantly well but then he accepted it as was because i was the source i even left my window out of it completely i could do that with him and get away with it because hed known me years he didnt question my reliability i didnt want my room all cluttered up with dicks and cops taking turns nosing out of the window in this hot weather let them tackle it from the front well well see what we see he said ill keep you posted i hung up and sat back to watch and wait events i had a grandstand seat or rather a grandstand seat in reverse i could only see from behind the scenes but not from the front i couldnt watch boyne go to work i could only see the results when and if there were any nothing happened for the next few hours the police work that i knew must be going on was as invisible as police work should be the figure in the fourthfloor windows over there remained in sight alone and undisturbed he didnt go out he was restless roamed from room to room without staying in one place very long but he stayed in once i saw him eating againsitting down this timeand once he shaved and once he even tried to read the paper but he didnt stay with it long little unseen wheels were in motion around him small and harmless as yet preliminaries if he knew i wondered to myself would he remain there quiescent like that or would he try to bolt out and flee that mightnt depend so much upon his guilt as upon his sense of immunity his feeling that he could outwit them of his guilt i myself was already convinced or i wouldnt have taken the step i had at three my phone rang boyne calling back jeffries well i dont know cant you give me a little more than just a bald statement like that why i fenced why do i have to ive had a man over there making inquiries ive just had his report the building superintendent and several of the neighbours all agree she left for the country to try and regain her health early yesterday morning wait a minute did any of them see her leave according to your man no then all youve gotten is a secondhand version of an unsupported statement by him not an eyewitness account he was met returning from the depot after hed bought her ticket and seen her off on the train thats still an unsupported statement once removed ive sent a man down there to the station to try and check with the ticket agent if possible after all he should have been fairly conspicuous at that early hour and were keeping him under observation of course in the meantime watching all his movements the first chance we get were going to jump in and search the place i had a feeling that they wouldnt find anything even if they did dont expect anything more from me ive dropped it in your lap ive given you all i have to give a name an address and an opinion yes and ive always valued your opinion highly before now jeff but now you dont that it not at all the thing is we havent turned up anything that seems to bear out your impression so far you havent gotten very far along so far he went back to his previous cliché well well see what we see let you know later another hour or so went by and sunset came on i saw him start to get ready to go out over there he put on his hat put his hand in his pocket and stood still looking at it for a minute counting change i guess it gave me a peculiar sense of suppressed excitement knowing they were going to come in the minute he left i thought grimly as i saw him take a last look around if youve got anything to hide brother nows the time to hide it he left a breathholding interval of misleading emptiness descended on the flat a threealarm fire couldnt have pulled my eyes off those windows suddenly the door by which he had just left parted slightly and two men insinuated themselves one behind the other there they were now they closed it behind them separated at once and got busy one took the bedroom one the kitchen and they started to work their way toward one another again from those extremes of the flat they were thorough i could see them going over everything from top to bottom they took the living room together one cased one side the other man the other theyd already finished before the warning caught them i could tell that by the way they straightened up and stood facing one another frustratedly for a minute then both their heads turned sharply as at a tipoff by doorbell that he was coming back they got out fast i wasnt unduly disheartened id expected that my own feeling all along had been that they wouldnt find anything incriminating around the trunk had gone he came in with a mountainous brownpaper bag sitting in the curve of one arm i watched him closely to see if hed discover that someone had been there in his absence apparently he didnt theyd been adroit about it he stayed in the rest of the night sat tight safe and sound he did some desultory drinking i could see him sitting there by the window and his hand would hoist every once in awhile but not to excess apparently everything was under control the tension had eased now that the trunk was out watching him across the night i speculated why doesnt he get out if i am right about him and i am why does he stick aroundafter it that brought its own answer because he doesnt know anyones on to him yet he doesnt think theres any hurry to go too soon right after she has would be more dangerous than to stay awhile the night wore on i sat there waiting for boyne s call it came later than i thought it would i picked the phone up in the dark he was getting ready to go to bed over there now hed risen from where hed been sitting drinking in the kitchen and put the light out he went into the living room lit that he started to pull his shirttail up out of his belt boyne s voice was in my ear as my eyes were on him over there threecornered arrangement hello jeff listen absolutely nothing we searched the place while he was out i nearly said i know you did i saw it but checked myself in time and didnt turn up a thing but he stopped as though this was going to be important i waited impatiently for him to go ahead downstairs in his letter box we found a post card waiting for him we fished it up out of the slot with bent pins and and it was from his wife written only yesterday from some farm upcountry heres the message we copied arrived o k already feeling a little better love anna i said faintly but stubbornly you say written only yesterday have you proof of that what was the postmarkdate on it he made a disgusted sound down in his tonsils at me not it the postmark was blurred a corner of it got wet and the ink smudged all of it blurred the yeardate he admitted the hour and the month came out o k august and seven thirty p m it was mailed at this time i made the disgusted sound in my larynx august seven thirty pm or or you have no proof how it got into that mail box whether it came from a letter carriers pouch or from the back of some bureau drawer give up jeff he said theres such a thing as going too far i dont know what i would have said that is if i hadnt happened to have my eyes on the thorwald flat living room windows just then probably very little the post card had shaken me whether i admitted it or not but i was looking over there the light had gone out as soon as hed taken his shirt off but the bedroom didnt light up a matchflare winked from the living room low down as from an easy chair or sofa with two unused beds in the bedroom he was still staying out of there boyne i said in a glassy voice i dont care what post cards from the other world youve turned up i say that man has done away with his wife trace that trunk he shipped out open it up when youve located itand i think youll find her and i hung up without waiting to hear what he was going to do about it he didnt ring back so i suspected he was going to give my suggestion a spin after all in spite of his loudly proclaimed scepticism i stayed there by the window all night keeping a sort of deathwatch there were two more matchflares after the first at about halfhour intervals nothing more than that so possibly he was asleep over there possibly not i had to sleep some time myself and i finally succumbed in the flaming light of the early sun anything that he was going to do he would have done under cover of darkness and not waited for broad daylight there wouldnt be anything much to watch for a while now and what was there that he needed to do any more anyway nothing just sit tight and let a little disarming time slip by it seemed like five minutes later that sam came over and touched me but it was already high noon i said irritably didnt you lamp that note i pinned up for you to let me sleep he said yeah but its your old friend inspector boyne i figured youd sure want to it was a personal visit this time boyne came into the room behind him without waiting and without much cordiality i said to get rid of sam go inside and smack a couple of eggs together boyne began in a galvanisediron voice jeff what do you mean by doing anything like this to me ive made a fool out of myself thanks to you sending my men out right and left on wildgoose chases thank god i didnt put my foot in it any worse than i did and have this guy picked up and brought in for questioning oh then you dont think thats necessary i suggested drily the look he gave me took care of that im not alone in the department you know there are men over me im accountable to for my actions that looks great dont it sending one of my fellows onehalfadays train ride up into the sticks to some godforsaken whistlestop or other at departmental expense then you located the trunk we traced it through the express agency he said flintily and you opened it we did better than that we got in touch with the various farmhouses in the immediate locality and mrs thorwald came down to the junction in a producetruck from one of them and opened it for him herself with her own keys very few men have ever gotten a look from an old friend such as i got from him at the door he said stiff as a rifle barrel just lets forget all about it shall we thats about the kindest thing either one of us can do for the other youre not yourself and im out a little of my own pocket money time and temper lets let it go at that if you want to telephone me in future ill be glad to give you my home number the door went whopp behind him for about ten minutes after he stormed out my numbed mind was in a sort of straitjacket then it started to wriggle its way free the hell with the police i cant prove it to them maybe but i can prove it to myself one way or the other once and for all either im wrong or im right hes got his armour on against them but his back is naked and unprotected against me i called sam in whatever became of that spyglass we used to have when we were bumming around on that cabincruiser that season he found it some place downstairs and came in with it blowing on it and rubbing it along his sleeve i let it lie idle in my lap first i took a piece of paper and a pencil and wrote six words on it what have you done with her i sealed it in an envelope and left the envelope blank i said to sam now heres what i want you to do and i want you to be slick about it you take this go in that building climb the stairs to the fourthfloor rear and ease it under the door youre fast at least you used to be lets see if youre fast enough to keep from being caught at it then when you get safely down again give the outside doorbell a little poke to attract attention his mouth started to open and dont ask me any questions you understand im not fooling he went and i got the spyglass ready i got him in the right focus after a minute or two a face leaped up and i was really seeing him for the first time darkhaired but unmistakable scandinavian ancestry looked like a sinewy customer although he didnt run to much bulk about five minutes went by his head turned sharply profilewards that was the bellpoke right there the note must be in already he gave me the back of his head as he went back toward the flatdoor the lens could follow him all the way to the rear where my unaided eyes hadnt been able to before he opened the door first missed seeing it looked out on a level he closed it then he dipped straightened up he had it i could see him turning it this way and that he shifted in away from the door nearer the window he thought danger lay near the door safety away from it he didnt know it was the other way around the deeper into his own rooms he retreated the greater the danger hed torn it open he was reading it god how i watched his expression my eyes clung to it like leeches there was a sudden widening a pullingthe whole skin of his face seemed to stretch back behind the ears narrowing his eyes to mongoloids shock panic his hand pushed out and found the wall and he braced himself with it then he went back toward the door again slowly i could see him creeping up on it stalking it as though it were something alive he opened it so slenderly you couldnt see it at all peered fearfully through the crack then he closed it and he came back zigzag off balance from sheer reflex dismay he toppled into a chair and snatched up a drink out of the bottle neck itself this time and even while he was holding it to his lips his head was turned looking over his shoulder at the door that had suddenly thrown his secret in his face i put the glass down guilty guilty as all hell and the police be damned my hand started toward the phone came back again what was the use they wouldnt listen now any more than they had before you should have seen his face etc and i could hear boyne s answer anyone gets a jolt from an anonymous letter true or false you would yourself they had a real live mrs thorwald to show meor thought they had id have to show them the dead one to prove that they both werent one and the same i from my window had to show them a body well hed have to show me first it took hours before i got it i kept pegging away at it pegging away at it while the afternoon wore away meanwhile he was pacing back and forth there like a caged panther two minds with but one thought turned insideout in my case how to keep it hidden how to see that it wasnt kept hidden i was afraid he might try to light out but if he intended doing that he was going to wait until after dark apparently so i had a little time yet possibly he didnt want to himself unless he was driven to itstill felt that it was more dangerous than to stay the customary sights and sounds around me went on unnoticed while the main stream of my thoughts pounded like a torrent against that one obstacle stubbornly damming them up how to get him to give the location away to me so that i could give it away in turn to the police i was dimly conscious i remember of the landlord or somebody bringing in a prospective tenant to look at the sixthfloor apartment the one that had already been finished this was two over thorwalds they were still at work on the inbetween one at one point an odd little bit of synchronisation completely accidental of course cropped up landlord and tenant both happened to be near the living room windows on the sixth at the same moment that thorwald was near those on the fourth both parties moved onward simultaneously into the kitchen from there and passing the blind spot of the wall appeared next at the kitchen windows it was uncanny they were almost like precisionstrollers or puppets manipulated on one and the same string it probably wouldnt have happened again just like that in another fifty years immediately afterwards they digressed never to repeat themselves like that again the thing was something about it had disturbed me there had been some slight flaw or hitch to mar its smoothness i tried for a moment or two to figure out what it had been and couldnt the landlord and tenant had gone now and only thorwald was in sight my unaided memory wasnt enough to recapture it for me my eyesight might have if it had been repeated but it wasnt it sank into my subconscious to ferment there like yeast while i went back to the main problem at hand i got it finally it was well after dark but i finally hit on a way it mightnt work it was cumbersome and roundabout but it was the only way i could think of an alarmed turn of the head a quick precautionary step in one certain direction was all i needed and to get this brief flickering transitory giveaway i needed two phone calls and an absence of about half an hour on his part between them i leafed a directory by matchlight until id found what i wanted thorwald lars bndct swansea i blew out the match picked up the phone in the dark it was like television i could see to the other end of my call only not along the wire but by a direct channel of vision from window to window he said hullo gruffly i thought how strange this is ive been accusing him of murder for three days straight and only now im hearing his voice for the first time i didnt try to disguise my own voice after all hed never see me and id never see him i said you got my note he said guardedly who is this just somebody who happens to know he said craftily know what know what you know you and i were the only ones he controlled himself well i didnt hear a sound but he didnt know he was open another way too i had the glass balanced there at proper height on two large books on the sill through the window i saw him pull open the collar of his shirt as though its stricture was intolerable then he backed his hand over his eyes like you do when theres a light blinding you his voice came back firmly i dont know what youre talking about business thats what im talking about it should be worth something to me shouldnt it to keep it from going any further i wanted to keep him from catching on that it was the windows i still needed them i needed them now more than ever you werent very careful about your door the other night or maybe the draft swung it open a little that hit him where he lived even the stomachheave reached me over the wire you didnt see anything there wasnt anything to see thats up to you why should i go to the police i coughed a little if it would pay me not to oh he said and there was relief of a sort in it dyou want tosee me is that it that would be the best way wouldnt it how much can you bring with you for now ive only got about seventy dollars around here all right then we can arrange the rest for later do you know where lakeside park is im near there now suppose we make it there that was about thirty minutes away fifteen there and fifteen back theres a little pavilion as you go in how many of you are there he asked cautiously just me it pays to keep things to yourself that way you dont have to divvy up he seemed to like that too ill take a run out he said just to see what its all about i watched him more closely than ever after hed hung up he flitted straight through to the end room the bedroom that he didnt go near any more he disappeared into a clothescloset in there stayed a minute came out again he must have taken something out of a hidden cranny or niche in there that even the dicks had missed i could tell by the pistonlike motion of his hand just before it disappeared inside his coat what it was a gun its a good thing i thought im not out there in lakeside park waiting for my seventy dollars the place blacked and he was on his way i called sam in i want you to do something for me thats a little risky in fact damn risky you might break a leg or you might get shot or you might even get pinched weve been together ten years and i wouldnt ask you anything like that if i could do it myself but i cant and its got to be done then i told him go out the back way cross the back yard fences and see if you can get into that fourthfloor flat up the fire escape hes left one of the windows down a little from the top what do you want me to look for nothing the police had been there already so what was the good of that there are three rooms over there i want you to disturb everything just a little bit in all three to show someones been in there turn up the edge of each rug a little shift every chair and table around a little leave the closet doors standing out dont pass up a thing here keep your eyes on this i took off my own wrist watch strapped it on him youve got twentyfive minutes starting from now if you stay within those twentyfive minutes nothing will happen to you when you see theyre up dont wait any longer get out and get out fast climb back down no he wouldnt remember in his excitement if hed left the windows up or not and i didnt want him to connect danger with the back of his place but with the front i wanted to keep my own window out of it latch the window down tight let yourself out the door and beat it out of the building the front way for your life im just an easy mark for you he said ruefully but he went he came out through our own basement door below me and scrambled over the fences if anyone had challenged him from one of the surrounding windows i was going to backstop for him explain id sent him down to look for something but no one did he made it pretty good for anyone his age he isnt so young any more even the fire escape backing the flat which was drawn up short he managed to contact by standing up on something he got in lit the light looked over at me i motioned him to go ahead not weaken i watched him at it there wasnt any way i could protect him now that he was in there even thorwald would be within his rights in shooting him downthis was break and entry i had to stay in back behind the scenes like i had been all along i couldnt get out in front of him as a lookout and shield him even the dicks had had a lookout posted he must have been tense doing it i was twice as tense watching him do it the twentyfive minutes took fifty to go by finally he came over to the window latched it fast the lights went and he was out hed made it i blew out a bellyful of breath that was twentyfive minutes old i heard him keying the street door and when he came up i said warningly leave the light out in here go and build yourself a great big twostory whisky punch youre as close to white as youll ever be thorwald came back twentynine minutes after hed left for lakeside park a pretty slim margin to hang a mans life on so now for the finale of the longwinded business and here was hoping i got my second phone call in before he had time to notice anything amiss it was tricky timing but id been sitting there with the receiver ready in my hand dialling the number over and over then killing it each time he came in on the of and i saved that much time the ring started before his hand came away from the light switch this was the one that was going to tell the story you were supposed to bring money not a gun thats why i didnt show up i saw the jolt that threw into him the window still had to stay out of it i saw you tap the inside of your coat where you had it as you came out on the street maybe he hadnt but he wouldnt remember by now whether he had or not you usually do when youre packing a gun and arent a habitual carrier too bad you had your trip out and back for nothing i didnt waste my time while you were gone though i know more now than i knew before this was the important part i had the glass up and i was practically fluoroscoping him ive found out whereit is you know what i mean i know now where youve gotit i was there while you were out not a word just quick breathing dont you believe me look around put the receiver down and take a look for yourself i found it he put it down moved as far as the living room entrance and touched off the lights he just looked around him once in a sweeping allembracing stare that didnt come to a head on any one fixed point didnt centre at all he was smiling grimly when he came back to the phone all he said softly and with malignant satisfaction was youre a liar then i saw him lay the receiver down and take his hand off it i hung up at my end the test had failed and yet it hadnt he hadnt given the location away as id hoped he would and yet that youre a liar was a tacit admission that it was there to be found somewhere around him somewhere on those premises in such a good place that he didnt have to worry about it didnt even have to look to make sure so there was a kind of sterile victory in my defeat but it wasnt worth a damn to me he was standing there with his back to me and i couldnt see what he was doing i knew the phone was somewhere in front of him but i thought he was just standing there pensive behind it his head was slightly lowered that was all id hung up at my end i didnt even see his elbow move and if his index finger did i couldnt see it he stood like that a moment or two then finally he moved aside the lights went out over there i lost him he was careful not even to strike matches like he sometimes did in the dark my mind no longer distracted by having him to look at i turned to trying to recapture something elsethat troublesome little hitch in synchronisation that had occurred this afternoon when the renting agent and he both moved simultaneously from one window to the next the closest i could get was this it was like when youre looking at someone through a pane of imperfect glass and a flaw in the glass distorts the symmetry of the reflected image for a second until it has gone on past that point yet that wouldnt do that was not it the windows had been open and there had been no glass between and i hadnt been using the lens at the time my phone rang boyne i supposed it wouldnt be anyone else at this hour maybe after reflecting on the way hed jumped all over mei said hello unguardedly in my own normal voice there wasnt any answer i said hello hello hello i kept giving away samples of my voice there wasnt a sound from first to last i hung up finally it was still dark over there i noticed sam looked in to check out he was a bit thicktongued from his restorative drink he said something about awri if i go now i half heard him i was trying to figure out another way of trapping him over there into giving away the right spot i motioned my consent absently he went a little unsteadily down the stairs to the ground floor and after a delaying moment or two i heard the street door close after him poor sam he wasnt much used to liquor i was left alone in the house one chair the limit of my freedom of movement suddenly a light went on over there again just momentarily to go right out again afterwards he must have needed it for something to locate something that he had already been looking for and found he wasnt able to put his hands on readily without it he found it whatever it was almost immediately and moved back at once to put the lights out again as he turned to do so i saw him give a glance out the window he didnt come to the window to do it he just shot it out in passing something about it struck me as different from any of the others id seen him give in all the time id been watching him if you can qualify such an elusive thing as a glance i would have termed it a glance with a purpose it was certainly anything but vacant or random it had a bright spark of fixity in it it wasnt one of those precautionary sweeps id seen him give either it hadnt started over on the other side and worked its way around to my side the right it had hit deadcentre at my bay window for just a split second while it lasted and then was gone again and the lights were gone and he was gone sometimes your senses take things in without your mind translating them into their proper meaning my eyes saw that look my mind refused to smelter it properly it was meaningless i thought an unintentional bullseye that just happened to hit square over here as he went toward the lights on his way out delayed action a wordless ring of the phone to test a voice a period of bated darkness following that in which two could have played at the same gamestalking one anothers windowsquares unseen a lastmoment flicker of the lights that was bad strategy but unavoidable a parting glance radioactive with malignant intention all these things sank in without fusing my eyes did their job it was my mind that didntor at least took its time about it seconds went by in packages of sixty it was very still around the familiar quadrangle formed by the back of the houses sort of a breathless stillness and then a sound came into it starting up from nowhere nothing the unmistakable spaced clicking a cricket makes in the silence of the night i thought of sams superstition about them that he claimed had never failed to fulfil itself yet if that was the case it looked bad for somebody in one of these slumbering houses around here sam had been gone only about ten minutes and now he was back again he must have forgotten something that drink was responsible maybe his hat or maybe even the key to his own quarters uptown he knew i couldnt come down and let him in and he was trying to be quiet about it thinking perhaps id dozed off all i could hear was this faint jiggling down at the lock of the front door it was one of those oldfashioned stoop houses with an outer pair of storm doors that were allowed to swing free all night and then a small vestibule and then the inner door worked by a simple iron key the liquor had made his hand a little unreliable although hed had this difficulty once or twice before even without it a match would have helped him find the keyhole quicker but then sam doesnt smoke i knew he wasnt likely to have one on him the sound had stopped now he must have given up gone away again decided to let whatever it was go until tomorrow he hadnt gotten in because i knew his noisy way of letting doors coast shut by themselves too well and there hadnt been any sound of that sort that loose slap he always made then suddenly it exploded why at this particular moment i dont know that was some mystery of the inner workings of my own mind it flashed like waiting gunpowder which a spark has finally reached along a slow train drove all thoughts of sam and the front door and this and that completely out of my head it had been waiting there since midafternoon today and only nowmore of that delayed action damn that delayed action the renting agent and thorwald had both started even from the living room window an intervening gap of blind wall and both had reappeared at the kitchen window still one above the other but some sort of a hitch or flaw or jump had taken place right there that bothered me the eye is a reliable surveyor there wasnt anything the matter with their timing it was with their parallelness or whatever the word is the hitch had been vertical not horizontal there had been an upward jump now i had it now i knew and it couldnt wait it was too good they wanted a body now i had one for them sore or not boyne would have to listen to me now i didnt waste any time i dialled his precincthouse then and there in the dark working the slots in my lap by memory alone they didnt make much noise going around just a light click not even as distinct as that cricket out there he went home long ago the desk sergeant said this couldnt wait all right give me his home phone number he took a minute came back again trafalgar he said then nothing more well trafalgar what not a sound hello hello i tapped it operator ive been cut off give me that party again i couldnt get her either i hadnt been cut off my wire had been cut that had been too sudden right in the middle ofand to be cut like that it would have to be done somewhere right here inside the house with me outside it went underground delayed action this time final fatal altogether too late a voiceless ring of the phone a directionfinder of a look from over there sam seemingly trying to get back in a while ago surely death was somewhere inside the house here with me and i couldnt move i couldnt get up out of this chair even if i had gotten through to boyne just now that would have been too late there wasnt time enough now for one of those camerafinishes in this i could have shouted out the window to that gallery of sleeping rearwindow neighbours around me i supposed it would have brought them to the windows it couldnt have brought them over here in time by the time they had even figured which particular house it was coming from it would stop again be over with i didnt open my mouth not because i was brave but because it was so obviously useless hed be up in a minute he must be on the stairs now although i couldnt hear him not even a creak a creak would have been a relief would have placed him this was like being shut up in the dark with the silence of a gliding coiling cobra somewhere around you there wasnt a weapon in the place with me there were books there on the wall in the dark within reach me who never read the former owners books there was a bust of rousseau or montesquieu id never been able to decide which one of those gents with flowing manes topping them it was a monstrosity bisque clay but it too dated from before my occupancy i arched my middle upward from the chair seat and clawed desperately up at it twice my fingertips slipped off it then at the third raking i got it to teeter and the fourth brought it down into my lap pushing me down into the chair there was a steamer rug under me i didnt need it around me in this weather id been using it to soften the seat of the chair i tugged it out from under and mantled it around me like an indian braves blanket then i squirmed far down in the chair let my head and one shoulder dangle out over the arm on the side next to the wall i hoisted the bust to my other upward shoulder balanced it there precariously for a second head blanket tucked around its ears from the back in the dark it would looki hoped i proceeded to breathe adenoidally like someone in heavy upright sleep it wasnt hard my own breath was coming nearly that laboured anyway from tension he was good with knobs and hinges and things i never heard the door open and this one unlike the one downstairs was right behind me a little eddy of air puffed through the dark at me i could feel it because my scalp the real one was all wet at the roots of the hair right then if it was going to be a knife or headblow the dodge might give me a second chance that was the most i could hope for i knew my arms and shoulders are hefty id bring him down on me in a bearhug after the first slash or drive and break his neck or collarbone against me if it was going to be a gun hed get me anyway in the end a difference of a few seconds he had a gun i knew that he was going to use on me in the open over at lakeside park i was hoping that here indoors in order to make his own escape more practicable time was up the flash of the shot lit up the room for a second it was so dark or at least the corners of it like flickering weak lightning the bust bounced on my shoulder and disintegrated into chunks i thought he was jumping up and down on the floor for a minute with frustrated rage then when i saw him dart by me and lean over the window sill to look for a way out the sound transferred itself rearwards and downwards became a pummelling with hoof and hip at the street door the camerafinish after all but he still could have killed me five times i flung my body down into the narrow crevice between chair arm and wall but my legs were still up and so was my head and that one shoulder he whirled fired at me so close that it was like looking a sunrise in the face i didnt feel it soit hadnt hit you i heard him grunt to himself i think it was the last thing he said the rest of his life was all action not verbal he flung over the sill on one arm and dropped into the yard twostory drop he made it because he missed the cement landed on the sodstrip in the middle i jacked myself up over the chair arm and flung myself bodily forward at the window nearly hitting it chin first he went all right when life depends on it you go he took the first fence rolled over that belly wards he went over the second like a cat hands and feet pointed together in a spring then he was back in the rear yard of his own building he got up on something just about like sam hadthe rest was all footwork with quick little corkscrew twists at each landing stage sam had latched his windows down when he was over there but hed reopened one of them for ventilation on his return his whole life depended now on that casual unthinking little act second third he was up to his own windows hed made it something went wrong he veered out away from them in another pretzeltwist flashed up toward the fifth the one above something sparked in the darkness of one of his own windows where hed been just now and a shot thudded heavily out around the quadrangleenclosure like a big bass drum he passed the fifth the sixth got up to the roof hed made it a second time gee he loved life the guys in his own windows couldnt get him he was over them in a straight line and there was too much fire escape interlacing in the way i was too busy watching him to watch what was going on around me suddenly boyne was next to me sighting i heard him mutter i almost hate to do this hes got to fall so far he was balanced on the roof parapet up there with a star right over his head an unlucky star he stayed a minute too long trying to kill before he was killed or maybe he was killed and knew it a shot cracked high up against the sky the window pane flew apart all over the two of us and one of the books snapped right behind me boyne didnt say anything more about hating to do it my face was pressing outward against his arm the recoil of his elbow jarred my teeth i blew a clearing through the smoke to watch him go it was pretty horrible he took a minute to show anything standing up there on the parapet then he let his gun go as if to say i wont need this any more then he went after it he missed the fire escape entirely came all the way down on the outside he landed so far out he hit one of the projecting planks down there out of sight it bounced his body up like a springboard then it landed againfor good and that was all i said to boyne i got it i got it finally the fifthfloor flat the one over his that theyre still working on the cement kitchen floor raised above the level of the other rooms they wanted to comply with the fire laws and also obtain a dropped living room effect as cheaply as possible dig it up he went right over then and there down through the basement and over the fences to save time the electricity wasnt turned on yet in that one they had to use their torches it didnt take them long at that once theyd got started in about half an hour he came to the window and wigwagged over for my benefit it meant yes he didnt come over until nearly eight in the morning after theyd tidied up and taken them away both away the hot dead and the cold dead he said jeff i take it all back that damn fool that i sent up there about the trunkwell it wasnt his fault in a way im to blame he didnt have orders to check on the womans description only on the contents of the trunk he came back and touched on it in a general way i go home and im in bed already and suddenly pop into my brainone of the tenants i questioned two whole days ago had given us a few details and they didnt tally with his on several important points talk about being slow to catch on ive had that all the way through this damn thing i admitted ruefully i call it delayed action it nearly killed me im a police officer and youre not that how you happened to shine at the right time sure we came over to pick him up for questioning i left them planted there when we saw he wasnt in and came on over here by myself to square it up with you while we were waiting how did you happen to hit on that cement floor i told him about the freak synchronisation the renting agent showed up taller at the kitchen window in proportion to thorwald than he had been a moment before when both were at the living room windows together it was no secret that they were putting in cement floors topped by a cork composition and raising them considerable but it took on new meaning since the top floor one has been finished for some time it had to be the fifth heres the way i have it lined up just in theory shes been in ill health for years and hes been out of work and he got sick of that and of her both met this other shell be here later today theyre bringing her down under arrest he probably insured her for all he could get and then started to poison her slowly trying not to leave any trace i imagineand remember this is pure conjectureshe caught him at it that night the light was on all night caught on in some way or caught him in the act he lost his head and did the very thing he had wanted all along to avoid doing killed her by violence strangulation or a blow the rest had to be hastily improvised he got a better break than he deserved at that he thought of the apartment upstairs went up and looked around theyd just finished laying the floor the cement hadnt hardened yet and the materials were still around he gouged a trough out of it just wide enough to take her body put her in mixed fresh cement and recemented over her possibly raising the general level of the flooring an inch or two so that shed be safely covered a permanent odourless coffin next day the workmen came back laid down the cork surfacing on top of it without noticing anything i suppose hed used one of their own trowels to smooth it then he sent his accessory upstate fast near where his wife had been several summers before but to a different farmhouse where she wouldnt be recognised along with the trunk keys sent the trunk up after her and dropped himself an already used post card into his mailbox with the yeardate blurred in a week or two she would have probably committed suicide up there as mrs anna thorwald despondency due to ill health written him a farewell note and left her clothes beside some body of deep water it was risky but they might have succeeded in collecting the insurance at that by nine boyne and the rest had gone i was still sitting there in the chair too keyed up to sleep sam came in and said heres doc preston he showed up rubbing his hands in that way he has guess we can take that cast off your leg now you must be tired of sitting there all day doing nothing mary roberts rinehart mary roberts rineharts early life though painful could hardly have been better devised to produce the sort of writer she turned out to be when she was nine her father killed himself after failing as a salesman her mother took boarders into their pittsburgh home to make ends meet young rinehart began writing for her school paper and entering stories in pittsburgh press contests she earned a nursing degree worked on the hospital wards that dealt with the bluecollar and barfight traffic married a doctor bore three sons and did not return to writing until she was thirty within three years her second book the man in lower ten became the first detective novel to become a national bestseller in the united states in the wake of this phenomenal success she accompanied her husband to europe where he studied his specialty she applied her writing skills to articles about politics and medicine became a war correspondent for the saturday evening post used her nursing credentials to avoid the military ban on reporters at the front and won herself a second national reputation home again after the war she wrote ten more bestsellers numerous other books articles and short stories for the bigcirculation slicks and two smashhit plays in addition she found time to take part in the womansuffrage movement and to spread public awareness of breast cancer rinehart changed the course of american detective fiction by infusing into the puzzle the personal details that produce in readers a strong identification with the heroine thereby causing them to share her fear bafflement and final triumph despite its brevity the lipstick provides a look at the usual characteristics of rineharts stories the narrator is a selfreliant young woman whose eye for domestic detail the lipstick leads to the solution of the crime rinehart uses a bit of romance a touch of humour about as much development of minor characters as was typical of the genre in her day and an adversarial relationship between the heroine and the police this short form doesnt sustain a device that rinehart popularised in her novelsmaintaining suspense by keeping the plucky heroine in constant jeopardy critics called this the had i but known tactic and scoffed at it but it worked the lipstick i walked home after the coroners inquest mother had gone on in the car looking rather sick as she had ever since elinors death not that she had particularly cared for elinor she has a pattern of life which divides people into conformers and nonconformers the conformers pay their bills the first of the month go to church never by any chance get into anything but the society columns of the newspapers and regard marriage as the sine qua non of every female over twenty my cousin elinor hammond had flouted all this she had gone gaily through life as if she wakened each morning wondering what would be the most fun that day stretching her long lovely body between her silk sheetshow mother resented those sheetsand calling to poor tired old fred in his dressing room lets have some people in for cocktails fred anything you say darling it was always like that anything elinor said was all right with fred he worshiped her as i walked home that day i was remembering his face at the inquest he had looked dazed you know of no reason why yourwhy mrs hammond should take her own life none whatever there was nothing in her state of health to cause her anxiety nothing she had always seemed to be in perfect health she was consulting dr barclay she was tired she was doing too much he said unhappily yet there it was elinor had either fallen or jumped from that tenthfloor window of dr barclays waiting room and the coroner plainly believed she had jumped the doctor had not seen her at all that day only the nurse there was no one else in the reception room she testified the doctor was busy with a patient mrs hammond sat down and took off her hat then she picked up a magazine i went back to my office to copy some records i didnt see her again until the nurse was a pretty little thing she looked pale tell us what happened next said the coroner gently i heard the other patient leave about five minutes later she went out from the consulting room theres a door there into the hall when the doctor buzzed for the next case i went in to get mrs hammond she wasnt there i saw her hat but her bag was gone thenthen i heard people shouting in the street and i looked out the window what would you say was her mental condition that morning miss comings the coroner asked was she depressed i thought she seemed very cheerful the nurse said the window was open beside her yes i couldnt believe it until i the coroner excused her then it was clear that she had told all she knew when dr barclay was called i was surprised i had expected an elderly man but he was only in the late thirties and goodlooking knowing elinor i wondered except for fred who had no looks whatever she had had a passion for handsome men beside me i heard mother give a ladylike snort so thats it she said she had as much need for a psychiatrist as i have for a third leg but the doctor added little to what we already knew he had not seen elinor at all that morning when he rang the buzzer and nobody came he had gone into the reception room miss comings was leaning out the window all at once she began to scream fortunately a mrs thompson arrived at that time and took charge of her the doctor had gone down to the street but the ambulance had already arrived he was frank enough up to that time queried about the reason for elinors consulting him he tightened i have many patients like mrs hammond he said women who live on their nerves mrs hammond had been doing that for years that is all she mentioned no particular trouble he smiled faintly we all have troubles he said some we imagine some we magnify some are real but i would say that mrs hammond was an unusually normal person i had recommended that she go away for a rest i believe she meant to do so his voice was clipped and professional if elinor had been attracted to him it had been apparently a onesided affair you did not gather that she contemplated suicide no not at any time that is all they got out of him he evaded them on anything elinor had imagined or magnified his relations with his patients he said were confidential if he knew anything of value he would tell it but he did not mother nudged me as he finished probably in love with her hes had a shock thats certain he sat down near us and i watched him i saw him come to attention when the next witness was called it was the mrs thompson who had looked after the nurse a large motherlylooking woman she stated at once that she was not a patient i clean the doctors apartment once a week she said that day i needed a little money in advance so i went to see him she had not entered the office at once she had looked in and seen elinor so she had waited in the hall she had seen the last patient a woman leave by the consultingroom door and go down in the elevator a minute or so later she heard the nurse scream she was leaning out the window yelling her head off then the doctor ran in and i got her on a couch she said somebody had fallen out but she didnt say who it was asked how long she had been in the hall she thought about a quarter of an hour she was certain no other patients had entered during that time she would have seen them if they had you found something belonging to mrs hammond in the office didnt you yes sir i found her bag the bag it seemed had been behind the radiator in front of the window so that was that elinor having put her hat on the table had dropped her bag behind the radiator before she jumped somehow it didnt make sense to me the verdict was suicide while of unsound mind the window had been examined but there was the radiator in front of it and the general opinion seemed to be that a fall would have to be ruled out nobody mentioned murder in the face of mrs thompsons testimony it looked impossible fred listened to the verdict with blank eyes his sister margaret sitting beside him dressed in mourning rose and dr barclay stared straight ahead of him as though he did not hear it then he got up and went out and while i put mother in the car i saw him driving away still with that queer fixed look on his face i was in a fine state of fury as i walked home i had always liked elinor even when she had snatched fred from under my nose as mother rather inelegantly said as a matter of cold fact fred hammond never saw me after he met her he had worshiped her from the start and his white stunned face at the inquest only added to the mystery the fools i thought as though elinor would ever have jumped out of that window even if she had been in trouble she had never cared what people thought i remembered almost the last time i had seen her somebody had given a suppresseddesire party and elinor had gone with a huge red a on the front of her whitesatin dress mother nearly had a fit when she saw it i trust elinor she said that your scarlet letter does not mean what it appears to mean elinor had laughed what do you think aunt emma would you swear that never in your life that will do elinor mother said elinor had been very gay that night and she had enjoyed the little runin with mother perhaps that was one of the reasons i had liked her she could cope with mother she wasnt an only daughter living at home on an allowance which was threatened every now and then and she had brought laughter and gaiety into my small world mother was having tea when i got home she sat stiffly behind the tea tray and inspected me i cant see why you worry about this louise whats done is done after all she led fred a miserable life she made him happy and now shes dead i said also i dont believe she threw herself out that window then she fell i dont believe that either nonsense what do you believe but i had had enough i went upstairs to my room my mind was running in circles somebody had killed elinor and had got away with it yet who could have hated her enough for that a jealous wife that was possible i could see the hammond place from my window and the thought of fred sitting there alone was more than i could bear not that i had ever been in love with him in spite of mothers hopes i dressed and went down to dinner but i couldnt eat luckily it was mothers bridge night and after she and her three cronies were settled at the table i slipped out through the kitchen annie the cook was making sandwiches and cutting cake i told her to say i had gone to bed if i was asked for and went out freds house was only two blocks away set in its own grounds like ours and as i entered the driveway i saw a man standing there looking at the place i must have surprised him for he turned around and looked at me it was dr barclay he didnt recognise me he touched his hat and went out to the street and a moment later i heard his car start but if he had been in the house fred did not mention it i rang and he opened the door he seemed relieved when he saw me thought you were the damned police again he said come in ive sent the servants to bed we went into the library it looked as if it hadnt been dusted for a month elinors house had always looked that way full of people and cigarette smoke and used highball glasses but at least it had looked alive nowwell now it didnt so it was a surprise to see her bag lying on the table fred saw me looking at it police returned it today he said may i look inside it fred go to it he said dully theres no note there if thats what youre thinking i opened the bag it was crammed as usual compact rouge coin purse a zipper compartment with some bills in it a memorandum book a handkerchief smeared with lipstick a tiny perfume vial and some samples of dress material with a card pinned to them match slippers to these fred was watching me his eyes red and sunken i told you nothing i searched the bag again but i could not find the one thing which should have been there i closed the bag and put it back on the table fred was staring at a photograph of elinor in a silver frame all this police stuff he said why cant they just let her rest she was beautiful wasnt she lou she was indeed i said people said things margaret thought she was foolish and extravagant he glanced at the desk piled high with what looked like unopened bills maybe she was but what the hell did i care he seemed to expect some comment so i said you didnt have to buy her fred you had her she was devoted to you he gave me a faint smile like a frightened small boy who has been reassured she was lou he said i wasnt only her husband i was her father too she told me everything why she had to go to that damned doctor didnt you know she was going fred not until i found a bill from him he said grimly i told her i could prescribe a rest for her instead of her sitting for hours with that young puppy but she only laughed he talked on as if he were glad of an audience he had made her happy she went her own way sometimes but she always came back to him he considered the coroners verdict an outrage she fell she was always reckless about heights and he had made no plans except that margaret was coming to stay until he closed the place and as if the mere mention of her had summoned her at that minute margaret walked in i had never liked margaret hammond she was a tall angular woman older than fred and she merely nodded to me i decided to come tonight she said i dont like your being alone and tomorrow i want to inventory the house id like to have fathers portrait fred he winced at that there had been a long quarrel about old joe hammonds portrait ever since freds marriage not that elinor had cared about it but because margaret had wanted it she had held on to it i looked at margaret perhaps she was the nearest to a real enemy elinor had ever had she had hated the marriage had resented elinors easygoing extravagant life even now she could not help looking at the desk piled with bills id better straighten that for you fred she said well have to find out how you stand i know how i stand he got up and they confronted each other fred with his back to the desk as if even then he were trying to protect elinor from margarets prying eyes freds sister shrugged and let it go it was warm that night i walked slowly home i had gone nearly half the way when i realised i was being followed i stopped and turned but it was only a girl she spoke my name youre miss baring arent you yes you scared me half to death im sorry i saw you at the inquest today and a reporter told me your name were you a friend of mrs hammonds she was my cousin why the girl seemed to make a decision because i think she was pushed out that window she said im in an office across the street and i was looking out i didnt know who she was of course do you mean you saw it happen no but i saw her at the window hardly a minute before it happened and she was using a lipstick when i looked out again she wasshe was on the pavement the girl shivered i dont think a woman would use a lipstick just before she did a thing like that do you no i said youre sure it was mrs hammond you saw yes she had on a green dress and i had noticed her hair she didnt have a hat on iwell i went back tonight to see if the lipstick was on the pavement i couldnt find it but im pretty sure she still had it when she fell that was what i had not told fredthat elinors gold lipstick was missing from her bag we might go and look again i said do you mind the girl didnt mind but she would not tell me her name just call me smith she said i never saw her again and unless she reads this she will probably never know that she took the first step that solved the case because we found the lipstick in the gutter a dozen cars must have run over it it was crushed flat but elinors monogram was perfectly readable miss smith saw it and gasped so i was right she said the next minute she had hailed a bus and got on it it was late when i got to dr barclays office the next morning the reception room was empty so i went to the window and looked down i tried to think that i was going to jump and whether i would use a lipstick or not if i were the nurse came in i gave her my name and after a short wait she took me to the consulting room the doctor got up when he saw me and i merely put elinors lipstick on the desk in front of him and sat down i dont understand he said mrs hammond was at the window in your reception room using that lipstick only a minute before she fell i suppose you mean it fell with her i mean that she never killed herself do you think a woman would rouge her mouth just before she meant to dowhat were supposed to think she did he smiled wryly my dear girl if you saw as much of human nature as i do that wouldnt surprise you so elinor hammond jumped out your window with a lipstick in her hand and you watch the hammond house last night and then make a bolt for it when i appear if that makes sense that shocked him he hadnt recognised me before so it was you in the driveway well i suppose id better tell you and trust you to keep it to yourself i hadnt liked the way mr hammond looked at the inquest i was afraid he mightwell put a bullet in his head you couldnt stop it standing in the driveway i said sceptically he laughed at that then he sobered i see he said well miss baring whatever happened to mrs hammond i assure you i didnt do it as for being outside the house ive told you the truth i was wondering how to get in when you came along his sister had called me up she was worried i wouldnt rely on what margaret hammond says she hated elinor i got up and retrieved the lipstick he got up too and surveyed me unsmilingly youre a very young and attractive woman miss baring why not let this drop after all you cant bring her back i know she never killed herself i said stubbornly and went out i was less surprised than i might have been to find margaret in the reception room when i reached it she was standing close to the open window from which elinor had fallen and for a minute i thought she was going to jump herself margaret i said sharply she looked terrified when she saw me oh its you louise she said you frightened me she sat down abruptly she must have slipped lou it would be easy try it yourself but i shook my head i had no intention of leaning out that window not with margaret behind me she said she had come to pay freds bill for elinor and i let it go at that nevertheless i felt shivery as i went down in the elevator i had trouble starting my car which is how i happened to see her when she came out of the building she looked over the pavement and in the gutter so she either knew elinors lipstick had fallen with her or she had missed it out of the bag she didnt see me she hailed a taxi and got into it to this day i dont know why i followed her i did follow her however the taxi went on into the residential part of town on a thinly settled street it stopped and margaret got out she did not see me or my car she was looking at a frame house with a narrow front porch and as i watched she went up and rang the bell she was inside the house for almost an hour i began to feel idiotic there were so many possible reasons for her being there reasons which had nothing to do with elinor but when she finally came out i sat up in amazement the woman seeing her off on the porch was the mrs thompson of the inquest i stooped to fix my shoe as the taxi passed me but i dont believe margaret even saw the car nor did mrs thompson she sat down on the porch and was still there when i went up the steps she looked surprised rather than apprehensive i hope youre not selling anything she said not unpleasantly im not selling anything i said may i talk to you what about she was suspicious now its about a murder i said theres such a thing as being accessory after the fact and i think you know something you didnt tell at the hammond inquest her florid colour faded it wasnt a murder she said the verdict i know all about that nevertheless i think it was a murder what was miss hammond doing here if it wasnt mrs thompson looked startled but she recovered quickly i never saw her before she said she came to thank me for my testimony because it showed the poor thing did it herself and to pay you for it i suppose she flushed angrily nobody paid me anything and now youd better go if you think anybody can bribe me to lie youre wrong thats all she went in and slammed the door and i drove back to town puzzled over the whole business was she telling the truth or had there been something she had not told at the inquest certainly i believed that the doctor had known more than he had told i was late for lunch that day and mother was indignant i cant imagine why with nothing to do you are always late for meals she said ive had plenty to do mother i said ive been working on elinors murder she gave a ladylike squeal murder who would do such a thing well margaret for one she always loathed her women in margarets position in life do not commit crimes mother said pontifically really i dont know what has happened to you louise the idea of suspecting your friends shes no friend of mine elinor was so youll stir up all sorts of scandal murder indeed i warn you louise if you keep on with this idiotic idea youll find yourself spread all over the newspapers and ill stop your allowance with this dire threat she departed and i spent the afternoon wondering what dr barclay and the thompson woman knew or suspected and in getting a wave at elinors hairdressers the girl who set my hair told me something i hadnt known here i was waiting for her she said she was always prompt of course she never came and you mean you expected her here the day it happened thats right she agreed she had an appointment for four oclock when i got the paper on my way home i simply couldnt believe it shed always been so gay of course the last few weeks she hadnt been quite the same but how long since you noticed a change in her i asked well let me see about easter i think i remember i liked a new hat she had and she gave it to me then and there she said a funny thing too she said sometimes new hats were dangerous i may have looked better when i left the shop but my mind was doing pin wheels why were new hats dangerous and why had elinor changed since easter fred had dinner with us that evening at last he sat at the table and pushed his food around with a fork margaret hadnt come he said she was in bed with a headache and he spent most of the time talking about elinor it was ghastly of course even mother looked unhappy i wish youd eat something fred she said try to forget the whole thing you made her very happy always remember that i asked him if anything had upset elinor since easter he stared at me i dont remember anything lou except that she started going to that damned psychiatrist then why did she go to him fred mother inquired if she had any inhibitions i never noticed them if there was a barb in this he wasnt aware of it you saw him he said he is a goodlooking devil maybe she liked to look at him it would be a change from looking at me he went home soon after that in spite of his previous protests i thought he had resented the doctors good looks and elinors visits to him and i wondered if he was trying to build up a defence against her in his own mind to remember her as less than perfect in order to ease his tragic sense of loss i slept badly so i was late for breakfast the next morning mother had finished the paper and i took it tucked away on a back page was an item reporting that mrs thompson had been shot the night before i read and reread it she was not dead but her condition was critical all the police had been able to learn from the family was that she had been sitting alone on the front porch when it happened nobody had even heard the shot she had been found by her husband when he came home from a lodge meeting at eleven oclock she was unconscious and the hospital reported her as being still too low to make a statement so she had known something poor thing something that made her dangerous and again i remembered margaret going up the steps of the little house on charles street margaret searching for elinors lipstick in the street margaret who had hated elinor and who was now in possession of fred of old joe hammonds portrait of elinors silk sheets andi suddenly rememberedof freds automatic which had lain in his desk drawer for years i think it was the automatic which finally decided me anyhow i went to our local precinct stationhouse that afternoon and told a man behind a high desk that i wanted to see the person in charge hes busy the man said eying me indifferently all right i said if hes too busy to look into a murder then ill go downtown to headquarters whos been murdered ill tell him that there was an officer passing and the man called him young lady heres got a murder on her mind he said might see if the captains busy the captain was not busy but he wasnt interested either when i told him it was about elinor hammond he said he understood the case was closed and anyhow it hadnt happened in his district as mrs thompson was not in his district either and as he plainly thought i was either out of my mind or looking for publicity i finally gave up the man behind the desk grinned at me as i went out want us to call for the corpse he inquired i wouldnt ask you to call for a dead dog i told him bitterly but there was a result after all i drove around the rest of the afternoon trying to decide what to do when i got home i found mother in the hall theres a policeman here to see you she hissed what have you done i said i havent done anything its about elinor i want to see this man alone mother i think youre crazy she said furiously its all over she got into trouble and killed herself she was always headed for trouble the first thing you know youll be arrested yourself she followed me into the living room and before i could speak to the detective there she told him i had been acting strangely for days and she was going to call a doctor and put me to bed suppose we let her talk for herself he said now miss baring whats all this about a murder so i told him about elinor and the lipstick about her appointment at the hairdressers for shortly after the time she was lying dead on the pavement about my conviction that mrs thompson knew something she hadnt told i gather you think mrs hammond didnt kill herself is that it does it look like it i demanded then who did it i think it was her sisterinlaw mother almost had a fit at that she got up saying that i was hysterical but the detective did not move let her alone he said gruffly what about this sisterinlaw i found her in dr barclays office yesterday i said she insisted that elinor had fallen out the window maybe it sounds silly but she knew about the lipstick she tried to find it in the street i think she was in the office the day elinor was killed i think the thompson woman knew it and i think margaret hammond shot her shot her he said sharply is that the woman out on charles street yes he eyed me steadily why do you think miss hammond shot her because she went there yesterday morning to talk to her i followed her mother started again she couldnt understand my behaviour margaret had been in bed last night with a headache it would be easy to verify that the servants the detective waited patiently and then got up i have a little advice for you miss baring he said leave this to us if youre right and theres been a murder and a try at another one thats our job it was mother who went to bed that afternoon while i waited at the telephone and when the detective finally called me the news left me exactly where i had been before mrs thompson had recovered consciousness and made a statement she did not know who shot her or why but she insisted that margaret had visited her merely to thank her for her testimony which had shown definitely that elinor had either fallen or jumped out the window she had neither been offered nor given any money there was more to it however it appeared that mrs thompson had been worried since the inquest and had telephoned margaret to ask her if what bothered her was important as a matter of fact someone had entered the doctors office while she was in the hall but it was natural enough the detective said it was the one individual nobody ever really notices the postman the postman i said weakly exactly ive talked to him he saw mrs hammond in the office that morning he remembers her she had her hat off and she was reading a magazine did he see mrs thompson he didnt notice her but she saw him so he shot her last night the detective laughed he took his family to the movies last night and remember this miss baring that shot may have been an accident plenty of people carry guns now who never did before it was all very cheerio elinor had committed suicide and mrs thompson had been shot by someone who was practicing for hitler only i just didnt believe it i believed it even less after i had a visit from dr barclay that night mother was still in bed refusing to see me and i was listening to the radio when the maid showed him in im sorry to butt in like this he said i wont take much of your time then its not a professional call he looked surprised certainly not why because my mother thinks im losing my mind i said rather wildly elinor hammond is dead so let her lie mrs thompson is shot but why worry remember the papers remember the family name no scandal please youre in bad shape arent you how about going to bed ill talk to you later so im to go to bed i said nastily that would be nice and easy wouldnt it somebody is getting away with murder maybe two murders and everybody tries to hush me up even the police that jolted him youve been to the police why not why shouldnt the police be told just because you dont want it known that someone was pushed out of your office window he was angry but he tried to control himself see here he said youre dealing with things you dont understand why cant you stay out of this case there wasnt any case until i made one i said furiously why is everybody warning me off how do i know you didnt do it yourself you could have either you or the postman and he was at the movies the postman he said staring what do you mean the postman i suppose it was his astonished face which made me laugh i laughed and laughed i couldnt stop then i was crying too i couldnt stop that either without warning he slapped my face it jerked my head back but it stopped me thats the girl he said youd have had the neighbours in in another minute youd better go up to bed and ill send you some sleeping stuff from the drugstore i wouldnt take anything you sent me on a bet he ignored that believe it or not he said i didnt come here to attack you i came to ask you not to go out alone at night until i tell you that you may i mean what im saying he added dont go out of this house alone at night miss baringany night dont be ridiculous i said still raging why shouldnt i go out at night because it may be dangerous he said shortly i particularly want you to keep away from the hammond house he banged the front door when he went out and i spent the next half hour hating him like poison i was still angry when the phone rang it was margaret i suppose we have you to thank for the police coming here tonight she said why cant you leave us alone were in trouble enough without you making things worse all right i said recklessly now ill ask you one why did you visit mrs thompson yesterday morning and who shot her last night she gasped and hung up the receiver it was a half hour later when the druggists boy brought the sleeping tablets i took them to the kitchen and dropped them in the coal range while annie watched me with amazement she was fixing mothers hot milk i remember and she told me that clara the hammonds cook had been over she says things are queer over there she reported somebody started the furnace last night and the house was so hot this morning you couldnt live in it i didnt pay much attention i was still shaken then i saw annie look up and fred was standing on the kitchen porch may i come in he asked i was taking a walk and i saw the light he looked better i thought he said margaret was in bed and the house was lonely then he asked if annie would make him a cup of coffee i dont sleep much anyhow he said its hard to get adjusted and the house is hot ive been getting rid of a lot of stuff burning it so that explained the furnace i walked out with him when he left and watched him as he started home then i turned up the driveway again i was near the house when it happened i remember the shrubbery rustling but i never heard the shot something hit me on the head i fell and after that there was a complete blackout until i heard mothers voice i was in my own bed with a bandage around my head and an ache in it that made me dizzy the idea of her going out when you told her not to mother was saying i did my best said a masculine voice but you have a very stubborn daughter it was dr barclay he was standing beside the bed when i opened my eyes i remember saying you slapped me and a lot of good it did he retorted now look where you are i could see him better by that time he looked very queer one of his eyes was almost shut and his collar was a wilted mess i stared at him what happened i asked youve been in a fight more or less and whats this thing on my head that is what you get for disobeying orders i began to remember thenthe scuffling in the bushes and something knocking me down he reached over and took my pulse youve got a very pretty bullet graze on the side of your head he said also ive had to shave off quite a bit of your hair i suppose i wailed at that for he shifted from my pulse to my hand dont worry about that it was very pretty hair but it will grow again at least thank god youre here who did it who shot at me the postman of course he said and to my fury went out of the room i slept after that i suppose he had given me something anyhow it was the next morning before i heard the rest of the story mother had fallen for dr barclay completely and she wouldnt let him see me until my best silk blanket cover was on the bed even then in a hand mirror i looked dreadful with my head bandaged and my skin yellowishgray the doctor didnt seem to mind however he came in big and smiling with his right eye completely closed and told me i looked like the wrath of heaven youre not looking your best yourself i said oh that he observed touching his eye gingerly your mother put a silver knife smeared with butter on it last night quite a person mother he said i was to excuse his appearance because he had been busy all night with the police hed go and clean up youre not moving out of this room until i know whats been going on i stormed im running a fever right now out of pure excitement he put a big hand on my forehead no fever he said just your detective mind running in circles all right where do i start with the postman so then he told me along in the spring elinor had come to him with a queer story she said she was being followed it made her nervous in fact she was frightened it seemed that the man who was watching her wore a postmans uniform she would be having lunch at a restaurantperhaps with what she called a man friendand he would be outside a window he would turn up in all sorts of places it sounded fantastic but she swore it was true some faint ray of intelligence came to me do you mean it was this man mrs thompson saw going into your office shes already identified him the real letter carrier had been there earlier he had seen mrs hammond reading a magazine but he had gone before the thompson woman arrived the one she saw was the one whokilled elinor i knew before he told me i felt sick it was fred wasnt it it was fred hammond yes dr barclay reached over and took my hand tough luck my dear i was worried about it i tried to get her to go away but she wouldnt do it and then she wore a dress at a party with a scarlet a on it and i suppose that finished him its crazy i gasped he adored her he had an obsession about her he loved her yes but he was afraid he might lose her and he was wildly jealous but if he really loved her the line between love and hate is pretty fine and its just possible too that he felt she was never really his untilwell until no one else could have her so he killed her he killed her dr barclay said slowly he knew that nobody notices the postman so he walked into my office and but he was insane i said you cant send him to the chair nobody will send him to the chair the doctor hesitated i was too late last night i caught him just as he fired at you but he put up a real battle he got loose somehow and shot himself he went on quietly there was no question of freds guilt he said mrs thompson had identified his photograph as that of the postman she had seen going into the office and coming out shortly before she heard the nurse screaming the bullet with which she had been shot had come from freds gun and margaretpoor margarethad been suspicious of his sanity for a long time she came to see me yesterday after she learned the thompson woman had been shot she wanted her brother committed to an institution but she got hysterical when i mentioned the police i suppose there wasnt much of a case anyhow with mrs thompson apparently dying and the uniform gone gone gone how hed burned it in the furnace we found some charred buttons last night why did he try to kill mrs thompson i asked what did she know she remembered seeing a postman going in and out of my office she even described him and margaret found the uniform in the attic she knew then she collapsed she couldnt face fred she locked herself in her room trying to think what to do but she had told fred she was going to see mrs thompson that day and she thinks perhaps he knew she had found the uniform she doesnt know nor do i all we do know is that he left this house that night got out his car and tried to kill the only witness against him except you of course except me i said except you the doctor repeatedly dryly i tried to warn you you may remember but why me he had always liked me why would he try to kill me because you wouldnt leave things alone because you were a danger from the minute you insisted elinor had been murdered and because you asked margaret on the phone why she had visited mrs thompson and who had shot her you think he was listening in i know he was listening in he wasnt afraid of his sister she would have died to protect him and he knew it but here you were a child with a stick of dynamite and you come out with a thing like that that was when margaret sent me to warn you im sorry ive been a fool all along the doctors good eye twinkled i wouldnt go so far as that he said that stubbornness of yours really broke the case not that i like stubborn women i had difficulty in getting him back to the night before but he finally admitted that he had been watching the hammond house all evening and that when fred came to our kitchen door he had been just outside fred had seemed quiet drinking his coffee then i had walked out to the street with him it had looked all right at first fred had started down the street toward home and he followed behind the hedge but he lost him and he knew he was on his way back fred had his revolver lifted to shoot me when he grabbed him suddenly i was crying it was all horrible elinor at the window and fred behind her mrs thompson resting after a hard days work and fred shooting her and i myself dr barclay got out a grimy handkerchief and dried my eyes stop it he said its all over now and youre a plucky young woman louise baring dont spoil the record he rose abruptly im giving up your case therell be someone in to dress that head of yours why cant you do it im not that sort of doctor i looked up at him he was haggard with strain he was dirty he needed a shave and that eye of his was getting blacker by the minute but he was big and strong and sane a woman would be safe with him i thought although she could never tell him her dreams i dont see why you cant look after me i said if im to look bald id prefer you to see it after all you did it he grinned then to my surprise he leaned down and kissed me lightly on the cheek ive wanted to do that ever since you slammed that lipstick down in front of me he said and now will you please stop being a detective and concentrate on growing some hair on the side of your head because im going to be around for a considerable time when i looked up mother was in the doorway beaming robert leslie bellem in some short stories written for the pulp magazines during the s s and s robert leslie bellem demonstrated an ability to conform to the hardboiled formula and to transcend it at the same time it is fair enough to describe this prolific maverick with a string of clichés he possessed an ear for dialogue an eye for the ladies a sixth sense for humour in short he kept a finger on the pulse of popular fiction but he did more than that too critics marvel at bellems ability to stand out from the crowd of pulp writers even while remaining an enthusiastic member of the group he embraced every hardboiled convention of language character and milieu no slouch at slang he loved lurid language wisecracking and tough talk but there is always the sense that he was playing with words intentionally rather than working in a limited idiom his characters too fulfil the stereotypes of the pulps the femme fatale the starlet and of course the gumshoe himself but again there is a playfulness that endows the characterisations with a camp quality if his characters are sometimes intentional exaggerations of stereotypes his choice of milieu is suited to this particularly in his dan turner hollywood detective stories with its glitz and glamour contrasting with seediness with its posturing and poses and with its false promises tinseltown is the perfect backdrop for pulp characters unusually aware of the roles that they are playing on the stage of american life turner is not bellems only series characterthe prolific author used several othersbut the hollywood detective is certainly his most memorable the offbeat exuberance of the turner stories with their swift pace and fast talk kept readers eager for more for almost two decades from the characters first appearance in spicy detective in to his central role in the magazine created and named for him eight years later dan turner hollywood detective this sleuth has been first and foremost an entertainerwho was created managed and directed by a true artist of pulp fiction homicide highball i tossed another coin on the counter and the bleached blonde handed me three more baseballs i hefted one of them prepared to heave it but before i could let fly the yellowhaired gal dropped dead with a crushed skull five minutes later i was collared for the killing putting it that way it sounds about as impersonal as a telegram condensed to fifty words for economys sake it didnt seem so impersonal to me at the time though my neck was in a lonely spot and i mighty well realised it if ever a guy had been draped with a murder frame i was that guy the whole thing started the previous afternoon when roy cromwell ace director for paravox pix ankled into my agency office with an embarrassed look on his handsome mush he was a stalwart ape in the loudest set of tweeds this side of an air raid alarm and his fame for making hit films was exceeded only by his rep as a romeo in private life crossing my threshold he flashed me a sheepish grin hiya philo hows the best private eye in hollywood the name is dan turner i said mister to you he reddened still sore eh i never forget a raw deal i didnt mean it to be as raw as it turned out he protested mildly why pack a grudge ive got every reason to pack a grudge you had a girl in a sunset strip dice club one night a month ago the joint was raided you begged me to take the doll off your hands and pretend i was her escort like a dope i agreed he said i appreciated the favour honest i did sure i sneered only it developed that she was engaged to bernie ballantyne production mogul for paravox in other words your boss thats why you palmed her off on me if bernie found out you were entertaining his sweetie he might get even by dropping your option so you picked me for a fall guy but dan listen i waved him quiet so what happened bernie made me the target of his jealousy barred me off the lot i used to get all of the paravox snooping business picked up some fat fees but now thanks to you i cant even go through the gates thats where youre wrong cromwell said placatingly ballantyne wants to bury the hatchet yeah in my dandruff no hes got a job for you i gave him the surly focus quit ribbing a thousand dollars is no rib he took a check from his wallet threw it on my desk it was for a grand made out to me and signed with bernie ballantynes scrawled autograph thats only the retainer youll get more later my ire began to fade he must crave somebody cooled for this kind of geetus all the colour leaked out of cromwells pan left it a floury mask his glimmers bulged whwhat makes you think a thing like ththat he choked then he recovered some of his poise for a minute i thought you were serious shall we go on out to the studio bernies waiting i said okay and we hauled bunions leaving the building i wondered why my casual remark had put the director in such a dither for an instant hed acted like a bozo with something nasty on his conscience his packard speedster was parked down at the curb but i preferred my own jalopy for convenience i trailed him until a traffic semaphore separated us halfway to culver city cromwell beat the red light by a whisker pulled ahead and when i finally got a green signal id lost him i remembered this later although it didnt seem to matter at the time i didnt need anyone to guide me to bernie ballantynes private sanctum the paravox production bigwig had a layout of offices in the main executive building just inside the mammoth wrought iron entrance gates an assortment of secretaries passed me through the various anterooms until i came to the last one a sort of gothic waiting chamber architecturally designed to awe you before you entered the holy of holies i wasnt very impressed though i was too interested in a brunette honey who had just stepped out of ballantynes room i recognised her and said greetings toots she drew a sharp breath as she tabbed me she was a fragile little dish delicate as a spring breeze in a modish confection of white silk jersey her wavy hair was blueblack to match her peepers and she had a complexion three shades richer than the cream off the top of the bottle but there was a tremulous quiver to her ripe pomegranate lips and her mascara was smudged as if she had recently leaked a trace of brine this needled my curiosity since she was emerging from bernie ballantynes office youd naturally think he was responsible for her turning on the weeps which seemed queer in view of the fact that she was his fiancée vala duvalle she didnt look happy at meeting me mr tturner skip the formality and call me dannyboy you know the unfortunate jerk that took you off roy cromwells hands the night a certain dice drop got knocked over or have you forgotten how i stuck my neck out for an alleged pal and wound up on the wrong end of a hotfoot she drifted toward me in an aura of expensive fragrance please she whispered dont link my nname with roys bernie might hear you would that be such a disaster hon you know it would for roy and maybe for mme too i said then you shouldnt play with fire cromwells dynamite for a jane whos engaged to somebody else her piquant puss got pink roy and i are just good friends nothing more youve got to believe that sure but does bernie believe it he doesnt know anything about it and he mustnt he wont either unless somebody carries tales to him you w wouldnt do an ugly thing like that would you mr turner not unless i thought it would pay me dividends i said i was only kidding of course but the joke seemed to backfire a dismayed expression crossed her angelic map and she turned pelted out of the room before i could explain or apologize i heard her sobbing as she scrammed and the sound made me feel like the lowest heel in hollywood well nuts i could hunt her up later and make amends i decided meanwhile ballantyne was waiting for me i barged to his door ankled in hung the squint on him as he sat behind his ornate desk you wanted me bernie he was a quarrelsome little sourpuss with fretful glims and a thin petulant kisser surrounded by permanent sneer lines not yet thirty he was one of the most important powers in the flickering tintypes and like a lot of undersized runts he used that power the way youd swing a baseball bat in fact he had been a shortstop on several bush league ball teams before he came into the picture industry sit down he piped in his high reedy voice i said no thanks and set fire to a gasper blew a blob of fumes his way deliberately stayed on my dogs this gave me two advantages it showed him he couldnt boss me around and it allowed my sixfeetplus to tower over him stressing his lack of dimensions you could see he didnt like it he held his temper though climb off your horse hawkshaw so i had you barred from the lot so i made a mistake so im sorry can i help it if ive got a jealous nature you should learn to call your shots i said he shrugged i love vala so much it gets me down if i think shes interested in another man if anybody tried to take her away from me i believe id kill him then he grinned wryly forget i said that it doesnt include you much obliged she explained how you just happened to meet her casually at a party and took her to that dice club the night of the raid no hard feelings none at all i said if the duvalle cupcake had blown down ballantynes suspicions with such an outright lie it was okay by me i added i just passed her she looked upset she is upset thats why im hiring you i want you to find out whats troubling her why shes drawn large sums of money out of her bank account lately for no plausible reason i want to be told if shes in some kind of jam i said a blackmail jam for instance he twitched what gives you that idea when people act worried and draw big dough from the bank it usually spells shakedown i answered any cheap flatfoot could tell you that do you know of anything in her past that somebody could use as a basis for extortion no shes all right shes been that way ever since she became our top paravox star and there was never any hint of scandal in her private life before that to my knowledge his manicured fingernails drummed the polished desk ill admit the blackmail angle occurred to me though i even asked her about it pointblank a moment ago so thats why she looked so woeful i said did she spill anything nothing she denied she was in trouble of any kind i dont believe her of course i think shes being bled and i want to know why more important i want the blackmailers name ill fix him suppose its a dame instead of a guy a mean glitter came into ballantynes shoebutton peepers a dame they make coffins for dames too dont they i remembered an offhand crack id made to roy cromwell in my own office about his boss craving somebody cooled cromwell had nearly thrown a wingding until he saw i wasnt serious but now twice in the same dialogue bernie ballantyne was yodeling a murder threat chapter ii under arrest my assignment was to keep a constant tail on vala duvalle during the next few days check her movements her contacts as it happened she was currently working in a farce comedy opus being produced by ballantyne and directed by roy cromwell so the next morning i went on a location jaunt with the unitand ankled into a homicide frame up to my neck outdoor action scenes were to be shot on the amusement pier down at venice a oncepopular seashore resort that had recently become practically a ghost town since its beach got quarantined by the health authorities because of sewage pollution in the surf deserted by vacation tourists it made an ideal spot for a movie there was no gawking public to infest the premises no autograph maniacs to annoy the cast paravox had rented the whole amusement pier roped it off for camera purposes chattering extras thronged the midway played the sucker games squealed on the merrygorounds and the giant skyride that stretched its dizzy dipsydoodle tracks on slanted trestles over the water the duvalle quail playing the heroine was supposed to meet the leading man for the first time on this skyride according to the screwy scenario she was to fall in love with him while descending an incline at seventy miles an hour personally i thought the story smelled but then im just a private snoop not a critic and i didnt seem to be getting very far with my snooping cromwell insisted on eleventeen rehearsals of the preliminary crowd sequences in which vala duvalle didnt even appear bored she retired to her makeshift dressing room in the fun house and naturally i couldnt follow her there so i did the next best thing killed time by mingling with a bunch of extras and bit players prowling the pier there was one concession game that drew my attention a counter across the narrow open front of a rectangular cubicle on platforms toward the back wall of this joint dummy milk bottles were arranged in pyramids the idea being to knock them down by hurling baseballs at them of course the owner of the caper had leased it to paravox for the day the same as all the other concessionaires had done and the reason the game interested me was because i recognised the contract actress behind the counter the bleached blonde cutie who was taking the real owners place this yellowhaired wrens name was maizie murdock and id been on many a party with her in the old days i leaned an elbow on the counter having fun babe well dip me in peanut butter if it isnt dapper dan the wolf in sleuths clothing she gave me a welcoming smile how are you whereve you been keeping yourself i said hither and yon im fine and you okay but lonesome now that youve scratched me from your address book i started to tell her i had censorship trouble but never got the words out because just then somebody laid a hand on my arm i turned saw it was roy cromwell anything i can do for you i asked him he said sorry sherlock this is supposed to be the final rehearsal not a gabfest then he seemed to realise hed sounded like a director throwing his weight around and he made an apologetic mouth er i mean okay bub okay i waved him off ill powder i looked at the blonde murdock filly see you soon hon cromwell registered embarrassment on his handsome pan hey wait ive got an idea as long as youre here among the extras suppose you toss some baseballs at these bottles itll give me some action to focus my cameras on can do can do i said cromwell faded off behind me and i picked up a ball hurled it scored a clean miss i tried again twice did a little better then playacting i planked a coin on the counter and maizie murdock gave me three more baseballs i hefted one of them something whammed past my ear like a dirty grey streak the blur of motion made me duck and then the murdock doll let out a stricken bleat that was cut off in the middle as if someone had chopped it with an axe in fact i heard a chunking sound like a blunt hatchet hitting a ripe cocoanut i pinned the flabbergasted focus on maizie just in time to pipe a baseball caroming off her conk bouncing high in the air where it had bashed her a sudden open fracture appeared her blue peepers went glassy and she started to sag i yelped what the and vaulted the counter caught her as she toppled i was too late to do her any good though long before i had lowered her to the floor she had joined up with her ancestors shed been bumped for an instant the huge cast and technical crew didnt seem to savvy what had happened then chaos spilled over and the panic was on three people came sailing at me from the crush cromwell bernie ballantyne and vala duvalle id known cromwell was in the crowd of course but where bernie and vala came from was a mystery to me one minute they werent in sight and the following minute they were climbing my back like monkeys picking bananas the ballantyne runt was the worst offender he kept dragging at my shoulders and yowling call the cops get me some law help me with this murderer i hunched myself gave him a flip that sent him flying over into a far corner this seemed to be the duvalle brunettes cue to dig her fingernails at my glims she flurried at me clawing and screeching like a demented banshee you beast she caterwauled you loathesome slimy beast i snarled quiet kiddo and whapped her a stinger across the chops hard enough to send her staggering lay off me im not fooling roy cromwell copped a gander at my palm print on valas map and gave a perfect demonstration of a guy blowing his top why blast your soul he roared then he grabbed a baseball from the counter and pitched it at my favourite features if i hadnt dropped flat on my puss it would have been just too bad the throw was an absolute strike smoked past where my noggin had been an instant before had it hit me it would have rendered me defunct instead it crashed against the rear wall of the concession hard enough to split the woodwork in the same way maizie murdocks skull had been split by a previous toss i couldnt help tabbing the similarity rage boiled up inside me i rolled over scrambled upright snaked out my automatic from the shoulder holster where i always carry it for emergencies i thumbed the safety curled my finger around the trigger and got set to blast now then chum i rasped at the director one more move out of you and your form will need vulcanizing he froze the duvalle cupcake crouched near him whimpering bernie ballantyne seemed to shrink in his corner fear scrawled on his rodent profile the cops he kept mumbling softly isnt anybody going to call the cops yeah i lipped at him i am but first i want to know why you freaks jumped me because you killed that ggirl he piped in his reedy falsetto he stole a furtive glance at the murdock wrens remainders you ffractured her skull with a baseball i said you lie in your teeth small fry i hadnt made my throw when she got bopped ask cromwell i turned to the director tell him roy cromwell kept his glims glued on my gat dont expect any help from me turner i saw what happened meaning what you threw the ball at her i felt my gullet tightening so youre trying to frame me too why is it for personal reasons or just because you think its wise to string along with your boss i dont need any excuse for telling the truth he said sullenly i saw you heft the ball and draw it back but i didnt heave it did i sister i asked vala she ran trembling fingers through her blueblack coiffure i didnt see you i didnt know anything about it until i came out of my dressing room and bernie told me what youd done id believe him in preference to you though you would i sneered you know what side your cakes buttered on then i tried being reasonable look all of you if i croaked this cookie what was my motive cromwell said maybe because she was a nuisance nuisance i stared at him i heard her asking you why you scratched her name off your address book maybe shed been your sweetie and you ditched her maybe you thought shed make trouble the scornedwoman angle i dont know thats for the law to decide you want me pinched huh he lifted a shoulder for my money you saw a chance to get away with murder and you tried it the girl was a perfect target and you had a baseball in your hand and why did i have a baseball i bleeped ill tell you you asked me to throw at the bottles i moved a step toward him it was a fishy request i can see that now he turned pallid around the fringes are you accusing me of trying to frame you i said its a thought the impact of this idea hit him all of a sudden but why would i frame you unless i yeah exactly unless you were the killer yourself remember the ball you just slammed at me it was a perfect strike over the heart of the plate it splintered the boards of the back wall a guy who can heave the horsehide that hard could also crack a cupcakes cranium the same way bernie ballantyne thrust his beak into the conversation if you think you can pin your crime on roy think again i was near him at the time he threw nothing at miss murdock every bit player and extra in the crowd will testify to it yeah if you tell them to i growled he bridled you mean id use my position to force anyone to perjure damned right you would and not necessarily for cromwells sake either maybe for your own i seem to recall you used to be a bush league ball player in your early days a shortstop i believe whats that got to do with it accuracy and throwing power i fired back at him the ability to chuck a baseball and bean somebody or am i wrong in remembering how you made two bumpery threats when i talked to you in your office yesterday i figured this ought to set him back on his heels expected to see him do some squirming he didnt though his attention didnt seem to be on me at all instead he was staring past me as if glomming a hinge at something very soothing to the optics then suddenly he barked arrest this man officer hes the one you want hes the murderer i whirled but i was a split second too slow a pair of harness bulls from the venice police force had sneaked up behind me with their roscoes unlimbered evidently some wise apple in the cast or technical crew had put in a bleat for them while my back was turned now they thrust their rods into my ribs and told me i was under arrest and would i drop my gat before they shoved a load of lead through my liver chapter three one for dave theres something about a coppers positive that spells authority twos are twice as nasty moreover i didnt have any drag in venice hollywood is my territory and my private detective badge is no good outside the city limits i was a cooked goose and i knew it sure boys i said sure ill drop my gat i let it fall and held out my mitts for the nippers one of the bulls bolstered his heater reached into his handcuff sheath for a pair of bracelets this reduced the odds but not too much i was still in an ugly jackpot i yelled look out ballantynes going to shoot the second cop had quick reflexes he pivoted toward bernie ready for fireworks when he realised the undersized producer didnt have a gun he wheeled back to me cursing at the top of his adenoids that was when i kicked his out of his clutch the weapon went skittering he dived after it which was a serious error on his part i tripped him as he plunged sent him skidding on his profile he collected a nostril full of splinters and loudly called on heaven to witness that hed been stabbed meanwhile i swung a hellroaring haymaker at his partners prow the punch connected which made two brass buttoned heroes down on the deck i tensed my thews and sinews uncoiled myself and cleared the counter in one fell swoop now i was on the midway of the amusement pier hemmed in by extras and grips and a miscellaneous movie mob dames squalled and guys tried to hang the grab on me i lowered my noggin bucked the line rammed three carpenters and an electrician floundering on their backs directly opposite the baseball target concession there was a high circular tower thrusting its spire upward like an overgrown totem pole it even looked like a totem pole its exterior decorated by a big spiral serpent of papier mache and plaster of paris the head and face of this giant dragon formed the towers exit at pierfloor level its vast mouth open and framed by redpainted fangs the serpentine body coiled upward around the tall structure with its massive tail forming a sort of spire at the distant top away up there you could lamp a sort of platform all guarded by wooden railings down on the pier alongside the dragons exit mouth there was an entrance flanked by a ticket booth a sign above the little booth said view the shoreline from the highest spot in venice ioc escalator moving stairway now running slide down the biggest thrill on the west coast oc a wild hunch sneaked up my back i plunged toward the tower entrance catapulted past the ticket wicket gained the escalator behind me a roscoe sneezed kachow and a red hot hornet buzzed past my ear that would be the cops having a spot of target practice at my expense i bent low blipped onto the moving stairs felt myself being liftedbut not fast enough to suit me i started running upward the first leg of the escalator ended on a little landing you stepped off walked onto the next flight which ascended in the reverse direction a zigzag effect this was repeated twice more then you were on the very top platform away to hell and gone up in the air with nothing but a wooden guard rail between you and a sheer drop to the ocean on one side or the pier on the other the view was terrific i wasnt very interested in it though at least not the water in fact the breaking waves could have been made of vat and i wouldnt have liked them from that high up to dive into the drink from such a height would make toothpicks of every bone in your skeleton the thought gave me goose pimples big enough to hang pictures on i turned stared down at the pier and the crowds milling around the escalator entrance i could look straight into the baseball concession across the midway piped maizie murdocks crumpled remnants and bernie ballantyne holding vala duvalle in his embrace trying to soothe her cromwell stood to one side peering toward the base of the tower straight under me the people down there were chattering pointing but i didnt lamp any trace of the two cops i thought i knew why above the clattery racket of the machinery that worked the moving stairway i heard thumping footfalls getting closer those bulls were on their way up to nab me both of them i breathed a relieved sigh as i doped this out it meant a break for my side because the dizzy numbskuls had neglected to post a guard at the lower exitthe mouth of the stucco dragon my whole future hinged on that omission to my right up on the top platform there was a mawlike orifice resembling the entrance to a dark tunnel the tunnel itself slanted downward at a steep pitch curving spirally lined with smooth wooden corduroy strips that were polished to a gloss from friction this tunnel was the interior of the serpentine dragon that wound itself around the tower from spire to foundation it was a giant slide the kind where you sit on a chunk of carpet give yourself a push and go circling downward at a thundering clip i selected a rug sample from the pile at the slide entrance i adjusted it settled myself on it and cast off with my fingers crossed whammo my dizzy descent was something ill keep dreaming about from now on around and around down and down i went with gravity pulling me and centrifugal force slamming me sidewise against the chutes hardwoodstrip walls all the breath leaked out of my bellows and i felt my optics popping like two grapes being squeezed the inventor of that maniac contraption had saved an extra thrill for the last third of the journey here the spiral pitch increased its rate of drop you hit a slight hump and then felt the whole tunnel floor going out from under your hip pockets blam i landed in an awkward sprawl and now i was circling toward the base at ninety miles a minute a horrible idea gnawed at me suppose one of the wooden corduroy strips came loose and skewered me nix i moaned not that and then my wild ride ended i was at pier level and i shot out of the dragons mouth like a shell from a cannon my glims were full of tears and my elbows full of abrasion blisters from friction contact i landed kerthump on a mattress placed strategically for the purpose it felt as if somebody had stuffed it with discarded horseshoes i staggered to my pins nobody tabbed me everyone was hanging the focus on the tower entrance nearby where those flatfeet had gone up the escalator after me i spun on my heel and started to run my jalopy was parked on the street that ended at the landward front of the pier i reached it piled in kicked the starter a savage wallop somebody spotted me as my cylinders came to life there he is i snarled you mean there he goes and stoked my boiler with ethyl three minutes later i was careening through venice under forced draft i ditched my bucket in ocean park because i knew there would be a radio bleat out for me in short order i didnt want a lot of prowl cars on the sniff for me looking for a veeeight coupe and its contents a public bus was my best bet and as luck would have it a big pacific electric red job was just getting ready to pull out i boarded it slipped the driver my fare and sat down in a rear seat bushed the ride back to town gave me time to get my mental cogwheels functioning busting loose from those venice bluecoats had been a screwball move maybe but i craved freedom in copious quantities it was the only way i could hope to haul myself out of this mess i was in pin maizie murdocks murder where it belonged of course i was on the lam now and by powdering i had made myself look guilty even so i was better off than if id been languishing in a seashore bastille you cant do any detecting in a cell moreover had i meekly submitted to the bulls theyd have closed the case and thrown away the key with all that false testimony against me i wouldnt have had the chance of a hailstone in the hot place as it was i dropped off the bus in hollywood around noon cocked and primed for action there were several angles i wanted to investigate and first on the list was the deceased murdock quails background her recent activities whenever theres a homicide theres also a motive find that motive and you can commence narrowing down your field of suspects to start with though i needed a spare roscoe mine had been confiscated on the amusement pier and i feel practically naked if my armpit rig is empty besides my nerves were frazzled around the fringes and the only thing that would mend them in a hurry was a good stiff prescription of scotch broth there was an extra rod in my stash plus a cellarette full of vat so i decided to go homeprovided the coast was clear i took a taxi had it ferry me twice around the block until i was satisfied no local coppers were lurking about the apartment entrance then i sneaked in through the basement garage and took the automatic elevator up to my floor unlocked the door of my igloo and ankled over the threshold whereupon a familiar voice said welcome home wise guy it was my friend dave donaldson of the homicide squad and he had me covered with his cannon i whirled hung the stupefied glimpse on his beefy features he leered complacently i figured youd show up here so i staked out and made myself comfortable thats breaking and entering i said not when ive got a john doe warrant it isnt this is an official visit bud can you guess why i said wearily yeah youre collaborating with those venice numbskulls im pinched he made admiring noises with his mouth you sure do catch on quick dont you lets take a little journey down to headquarters maybe ill even let you get in touch with some shyster before i send you back to the beach damn the beach i said also the sons whore trying to fasten a frame on my elbows ah so its a frame it always is he waggled his rodney reprovingly i wish killers would sing a different tune once in a while just to break the monotony i get tired of that one it stinks so it stinks i dredged a gasper from a crumpled pack on the table set fire to it so im not a killer have a jolt of skee while i tell you the score ill take the skee but i wont believe anything you warble and dont try to slip a mickey in my glass or ill bend this gat around your ears i put an injured expression on my mush as i poured him the snort and handed it to him i downed a double dollop myself and said you know i wouldnt feed you a mickey i wish id thought of it though its a swell idea about the kill he prompted me whyd you do it i didnt who did i dont knowyet whale feathers he said i got a full report over the teletype fiftyleven extras say you had the baseball in your fist just before the blonde bim got bopped roy cromwell says it so does bernie ballantyne what more do you want another drink i said and had it and a chance to prove theyre cockeyed liars about you having the ball i shook my head no that parts true enough then what are they lying about me throwing it at maizie i didnt well who did he persisted you already asked me i told you i dont knowyet he looked bland you could guess couldnt you sure but what good would it do me quit being clever you know youre just needling me trying to make me say something damaging youre not as coy as you think you are an inch of dew remained in the bottle i killed it a fine thing dave sounded aggrieved you didnt even offer to share it with me his tone hardened if youre so innocent you must have somebody in mind as a candidate come on name him okay ill name two cromwell and ballantyne he chuckled sourly thats what i thought youd say meaning what they accuse you so you accuse them boy are you corny i got sore look ive good reasons for pointing the finger their way want to listen i suppose it wont cost me anything speak your piece well cromwell jobbed me into tossing those first few baseballs and he stood directly behind me when the murder pill zipped past my ear to bash the blonde chick dave rubbed his chin bristles all right by a long stretch of the imagination well say he had opportunity although everybody around him claims he didnt throw anything skipping lightly over that what would be his motive what did he have against maizie murdock to make him want to kill her i dont knowyet get a new phrase that ones tiresome he said now lets consider your case against ballantyne i shrugged the same setup he was behind me when the death ball was heaved any motive possibly hes engaged to his star vala duvalle he thinks shes being blackmailed he hired me to look into it he hinted hed like to croak the blackmailer aha and maybe maizie murdock i nodded could be suppose he found out maizie was bleeding the duvalle cutie suppose he carried out his croakery hint it adds up but why did he then try to pin the job on you i had the answer ready jealousy i was with vala duvalle one night in a dice joint that got raided what were you doing trying to beat his time hell no and later he got over his peeve or pretended to but he may have been laying for me waiting for a chance to sink the harpoon in me dave stood up yawned finished sherlock ive told you all i know yes then lets go to the gow youre still under arrest frankly i dont believe a word youve told me i goggled at him you mean you intend to hand me to those brainless wonders in venice me your best friend yeh he lowered his voice confidentially i even pinched my own grandmother one time for robbing a blind man all my family are heels including me stick out your fins for the nippers and be quick about it i reached in my pocket for a coffin nail at the same instant my front door opened a crack and a roscoe stuttered kapow behind me the blast was bad enough but the slugs nearness was worse it scorched a blister on my left ear as it went by and then dave donaldson clapped a hand to his noggin lurched drunkenly and fell down gore commenced leaking from his furrowed scalp chapter iv the night of the raid i let out a strangled oath swung around hurled my heft at the door it was closed again by the time i reached it and it wouldnt open when i tugged at the knob somebody had jammed it from outside an acrid stench of burned gunpowder hung in the air stung my smeller i whirled and went racing bucketyblip to the kitchenette where my stash had a second exit into a short elbow corridor this portal worked okay i lunged out to the short hall pelted for the main one nobody was in sight when i got there though nobody that is except some nosy neighbours poking their beaks out to see what the shooting was about hey i rasped did any of you see it developed that nobody had tabbed anything i sailed down the main staircase no dice i drew a blank with the automatic elevator too but there was still a rear stairway i hadnt covered and there was no use trying to now the gunsel had long since had time to scram out of the buildingand out of the entire neighbourhood if he had a fast enough jalopy panting fire and brimstone i returned to my front door and found out what had jammed it some sharp disciple had wedged a colt between the knob and the doorcase in such a way that when you tried to open up from inside you merely made the wedge tighter it was no trick to dislodge the roscoe it had the same burned cordite odour id noticed in my wigwam an instant ago meaning this was the heater that had drilled dave donaldson i gave vent to a frantic bleat as i realized it now had my fingerprints on it from plucking it away from the knob and the short hairs prickled at the nape of my neck when i tumbled to another fact that was a lot worse the rod was my own the one those harness bulls had forced me to drop on the amusement pier i moaned for the love of and shoved my portal open so hard it almost came off its hinges once inside i kicked it shut again to keep out the busybodies then i hunkered down alongside donaldsons sprawled tonnage forced myself to look at his colourless puss he and i had been through plenty together month after month for more than ten years without a break now he was defunct and id probably be accused of creaming him he proved this by mumbling hello headquarters put out the net for that rat turner i was about to handcuff him when he shoved his fist in his pocket and shot me hello operator you cut me off say doctor have you got an aspirin on you a pound of hamburger please and heres the ration stamp yeah turner shot me chief delirious me well youd be delirious too if your hospital bed was as hard as mine feels like i was sleeping on the floor he opened his groggy glimmers took a swivel and bellowed by gosh i am on the floor realising he was alive made me feel as good as a guy having an abscessed tooth pulled the relief was terrific but the aftermath hurt like the devil that slug from the doorway had merely creased his cranium maced him silly but now he was conscious again and thought i was the bozo whod nicked him to make it lousier he tried to flounder up on his haunches i restrained him easy dave easy i said then i realised i was prodding him with the in my duke he lamped it and sagged back oh going to finish your job hunh his shoulders twitched okay im ready i snarled dont be a dope you dope i didnt plug you it came from the doorway hurry up and pull your trigger he ignored what i was saying and dont miss because in another minute im going to be strong enough to tangle with you thats a warning i tell you i he came off the floor slowly an inch at a time mayhem glittered in his glims and there was violence in his knotted mitts gonna beat your brains out he announced distinctly he swung a roundhouse haymaker missed and folded like a punctured balloon he was snoring before he hit the rug i hurdled him picked up my phone dialled headquarters the desk sergeant who came on the line didnt suspect anything when i said lieutenant donaldson speaking look ive just collared dan turner you can cancel the pickup order we had out for him im bringing him in personally okay lieutenant ill notify venice too right i said then i hung up and got out of there fast for a little while i knew id be safe cancelling that pickup order had been a stroke of sheer genius on my part now the radio prowl cars would quit hunting me i could move around without being forced to duck every time i piped a blue uniform and a set of brass buttons this wouldnt last long though pretty soon dave donaldson would wake up again phone his minions what had really happened then the heat would be on i blipped downstairs barged outdoors whistled a yellow over to the curb and piled in hollywood times brother dont spare the horses im in a yank presently we came to the newspaper building and i hotfooted up to the file room the attendant was a guy i knew hi larry i said a flabbergasted look came into his optics hawkshaw do you know the cops are yeah youre telling me i said bitterly im hotter than the inside of a stove lets understand each other if you figure to stool on me im leaving if you feel like helping me ill be grateful take your pick why ill help you of course if i can stooling is out of my line thanks hows for slipping me your envelope of clippings on a certain sunset strip dice joint raid about a month ago you remember the place i mean he said yes he remembered and scuttled to a file extracted a thick manila folder heres what you want your own pictures in it incidentally i knew that as well as he did the press photogs had made a roman holiday of the raid having been tipped in advance that it was going to be pulled theyd snapped a slew of pix which were smeared all over the following days front pages one shot showed vala duvalle clinging to my arm and looking hysterical with a caption under it paravox star with famous shamus this photo was the one that had subsequently given bernie ballantyne an attack of the jealous jitters i spread the clippings on a desk began studying them the silliest picture was of the phony grand duke mike voronoff restaurant proprietor and general moocher trying to sneak through an exit on his hands and knees there was another of roy cromwell haughtily informing a county cop that hed come stag to the jointa lie he got away with for the simple reason that he had palmed the duvalle brunette off on me a moment before and then there was a medium long shot of the whole place showing almost everybody whod been there when the law busted in this was the snap i particularly wanted to gander i glued the gaze on it hunting people i knew one yellowhaired cookie caught my attention she was maizie murdock i took a closer hinge to make sure there was no mistaking her bleached tresses and gamine pan she was with a pastyfaced jerk id never seen before a guy who didnt seem to amount to anything unless they gave medals for a victory garden of pimples on the chin i puckered my kisser whistled softly larry the newspaper file clerk ankled over something he said maybe i told him id like a phone and some privacy if you can manage it he led me to a secluded desk help yourself he left me there i fished a number from my mental notebook dialled it the bozo i called was pedro criqui a french spaniard whod been in more hot water than used tealeaves most recent on the list of his misfortunes was the fact that hed been the proprietor of that raided dice drop pedro i said ill see if hesa een holda wire oui stew that stall this is dan turner oh thatsa deeference how you are you sonagun you een troubles hah ees een the papers on radio you bumpa mamselle you beeg chomp sherlock you wanna keel somebody ees crazy to pull eet in poblic

unnastand english hah okay i soothed him so vala was strictly on the up and up with cromwell what night did this private room episode happen he said the night of the raid and started cursing the cops that knocked him over ees costing me all i ever win from guys like remind me to send you a towel to cry in i said and hung up on his dolorous moans now i had something i could sink my bridgework into the duvalle cupcake and roy cromwell had come downstairs from a private room the night of the raid their visit to the second floor had been brief true enough but they had come downstairs and anybody gandering them as they descended might have made gossip of it and maizie murdock had been in the joint that night and later vala duvalle had apparently been blackmailed and bernie ballantyne had threatened to kill the blackmailer and maizie murdock got croaked and bernie had been on the scene of the murder and he had tried to frame me for it i said softly turner youre a genius youll be a marvellous detective some day if you live long enough then i torched a gasper and left the newspaper building i wasnt very happy though i was afraid i might not live as long as a guy should if he hopes to be a marvellous detective chapter v a foul ball another taxi wafted me across town to the cheap apartment wikiup where the late lamented murdock quail had lived it was along toward dusk when i rousted out the manager a slatternly old hag with hennared hair that had grey streaks showing through if shed paid more than fifty cents a pint for the gin on her breath shed been robbed something dearie she asked me i gave her a swift squint at my badge not long enough to let her know it was only a private ops biscuit official business i said homicide headquarters from within the harridans flat a snivelling voice full of adenoids whined what is it maw so youre from headquarters the dame stared at me just another cop junior she called to the voice inside shut your mouth or ill kick it shut then to me juniors my son sometimes i wish id drowned him tell him were tired of cops the voice snivelled spitefully tell him to dust maw i said id like to ask you some questions lady questions she grumbled questions questions always its questions a burp boiled up from around her insteps oops sorry something i et no doubt the adenoids got vocal again whats he want maw quiet bum he wants to know about maizie of course she looked at me dont you yeah isnt this where miss murdock lived hey maw tell him to blow you ought to paste him maw it would learn him something she pitched her voice to a shrill infuriated screech sock cops is it you keep running off at the face and ill take you apart with a club then with no change of expression on her unlovely puss she lowered her tone to normal just like his old man a creep about miss murdock i said how many times have i go to go over it she made an indignant mouth ask those other dicks thats already been here for goodness sakes aint you flatfeet got nothing better to do but pester a body crazy heave him out maw the adenoids said she screamed will you button that lip of yours look i said reasonably can i help it if headquarters assigns me to check up on those other detectives im sorry to put you to so much trouble but the dame sighed okay she scratched herself ill tell it again maizie murdock lived here until yesterday you mean she moved i mean i changed the lock on her door and dragged her trunk to the cellar and held it on account she was six weeks behind in her rent dont ask me where she spent last night i dont know and i dont care my gullet felt tight all of a sudden what hey maw the adenoids whined the paper just come i got it off the back step you wanna hear something she ignored him sure dearie she told me maizie hadnt had no movie work in a long time she was broke she kept saying she had a job coming up with paravox a bit part on a one picture contract she kept saying shed have the rent money pretty soon now when she got her first pay i got tired waiting though i aint running no charity hall am i so last night i locked her out i felt as if a mule had kicked me in the short ribs maizie murdock had been broke for six weeks her paravox job the one that resulted in her decease had been the first shed had in a couple of months this information knocked all my theories into a cocked hat she couldnt have been the character who was blackmailing vala duvalle no matter how you figured it the answer came up that way if maizie had been the shakedown artist she would have had cash enough to pay her rent save herself from being locked out of her apartment since she didnt have the dough it stood to reason that she hadnt been putting the bite on the brunette duvalle cupcake therefore there was no motive for bernie ballantyne to have bumped her of course he might have mistakenly thought maizie was doing the blackmailing i couldnt quite see how he could jump at such a haywire conclusion however in view of the circumstances all told it began to look as if bernie was in the clear and i would have to hunt around for a fresh suspect i considered the director roy cromwell who could fling a baseball hard enough to splinter woodworkor a shemale skull hed been in a position to heave a lethal pellet at the murdock filly but for what motive listen i said to the apartment house hag did maizie ever have a gentleman friend named cromwell a tall handsome guy dressed in loud tweeds she didnt have no gentlemen friends dearie you mean they werent gentlemen i mean she didnt play that way not here anyhow she never had no men calling on her i run a decent house for respectable people and she kept her nose clean otherwise i wouldnt have let my junior take her out once in a while poor boy hes all busted up about what happened to her he liked her she was the only girl ever looked twice at him i said but he didnt like her well enough to keep you from putting her out of her apartment when she couldnt pay her rent hunh junior dont interfere with how i run my business he better not the little bum id take a broomstick to him i was up against a blank wall again if cromwell hadnt been on social terms with maizie he wouldnt have had any reason for cooling her off this seemed to erase him from my list of possible suspects along with bernie ballantyne from inside the managers flat adenoids bleated again it says in the paper maw shut up junior how do you know what it says in the paper you cant read i can too read listen maw it says that private dick got picked up in his own apartment right here in hollywood the one that killed maizie you know turner is his name a bull by the name of donaldson nabbed him but this turner guy shot him the paper says and made a getaway his picture is in the paperi mean turners picture wanna see it maw no the dame said neither did i the heat was on me again i realised donaldson must have recovered from his swoon phoned headquarters and started the dragnet rolling it was time for me to make myself scarce i started to say goodbye to the frowsy jane but all of a sudden my luck ran out junior came to the doorway with his newspaper lookit maw heres the guys picture i was telling you he cast an absentminded hinge at me twitched and did a doubletake maw thats him thats turner talking to you maw i should have whirled and lammed while the lamming was good but i couldnt my gams seemed paralysed i was hanging the stupefied focus on juniors pimply mush while recognition slammed through me he was the pastyfaced jerk who had been maizie murdocks escort in that dice joint the night of the raid the next couple of minutes were pretty blurry i finally got my brogans unlimbered and made a wild dive for the exit maw and junior blammed after me bellowing like a pair of halfwits they almost caught up with me as i gained the front door or at least junior did this cost him three front teeth he went down squalling his old lady stopped to inspect the damage to his kisser and i hightailed out of there with my back pockets dipping sand and my right duke aching where id hung a haymaker on the little jerk my taxi was still waiting at the curb where id left it the meter registered which was felonious but i was in no condition to argue i told the hacker to pull the pin and get going he did he also cast a knowing leer at me over his shoulder and said i been listenin to the radio thats nice symphony or swing newscast they put out a swell description of you pal so its that way i said dont get jumpy mr turner he grinned at me in the rearview mirror i dont like cops neither meaning you dont intend to blow the whistle not me he said virtuously thats for heels besides i guess maybe youre the kind that would treat a guy right if the guy levelled with you youre talking about dough of course i said he blipped past an amber light what else is there to talk about at a time like this i said youre a man after my own heart youd probably be after my kidneys and liver too if they were valuable enough i fished two tens out of my wallet handed them up to him how much loyalty will that buy ive maimed people for less you wanna go somewhere in particular or just ride around i want to go somewhere in particular but i dont know exactly where first lets find a phone he pulled in before a cheap groggery scouted the territory and reported no coppers in sight theres a booth at the end of the bar chum ill wait i barged into the ginmill located the telephone dropped a jitney and dialled pedro criqui again pedro ill see if hesa een holda wire oui lets not repeat that routine this is turner sucre nom de dieu whatsa your always calleeng me op hah ees bad enough you bumpa mamselle in venice but when you shooteeng policemans ees too moch goodbye please now wait a minute i said i didnt shoot lieutenant donaldson any more than i creamed maizie murdock im in a jam and i need help im sayeeng listen the night of the raid this murdock doll was there in your drop maybe you remember her maybe im do maybe im dont who ees caring she had a kid with her a yuck with pimples on a face only his mother could love which she doesnt know the jerk i mean pasty complexion skinny talks with adenoids ees sound like joe wilson this checked with the monicker on the apartment house hags mailbox wilson thats the one i said hesa no good a foul ball a regular patron of yours pedro laughed sourly whatsa you think hah i got no time for cheap nickels and dimes guys thees wilson keed i dont letting him in my place unless hesa got two tens to rub together he come once twice ees all hesa breeng blonde tomato weeth heem hesa shoot craps he losing his shirt and go home never up in the bucks eh not while my place ees open since i am being raided i dont knowing how much dough hesa got hell weeth heem have you heard if hes been going against any of the floating crap games around town since you got closed i hearing nothing you so smart you finding out for yourself hah aurevoir adios and do me a favour hang op he cut me off like a bill collector dark had settled when i went back out to my cabby i handed him another tenspot hows for finding me a couple of games i said dames he gave me an admiring look you can think of romance in a spot like yours not dames games floating ones dice oh that yeah sure he ferried me to a shoddy hotel off vine street and talked to a bellhop then he told me room go right up want i should join you and hold your winnings no thanks i went upstairs and had a brief conference in room with a furtive guy five minutes later i was down in my cab again the hacker remarked that i must have thrown an awful jolt of snakeeyes to get through so quick i said i certainly did find me another game he found me one and i had another conference presently i returned to the taxi any luck the cabby asked me not the kind i hoped for i said ive been checking on a dice player with adenoids how can anybody play dice with his adenoids the hacker sounded indignant i said thats the point he hasnt been which was true according to what i had just learned joe wilson an inveterate crap shooter had been hanging around the games for the past few weeks without rattling the bones at all he was suffering the financial shorts this kicked another theory in the teeth id thought perhaps the wilson jerk was blackmailing vala duvalle on the basis of having tabbed her with roy cromwell coming downstairs from a private room that night in pedro criquis drop in turn bernie ballantyne might have erroneously figured maizie murdock as the extortionist and made the grave mistake of cooling her but the pastyfaced wilson punk was broke therefore he wasnt reaping any shakedown lettuce he was as clean as maizie had beenand i was up a stump again riding along in the taxis tonneau i flared a match lit up a gasper bye and bye my cabby said you done yourself a dirty trick that time pal how come i did a cop car went by just as you had that match up to your map i think you been spotted he looked in his mirror i know damn well you been spotted theyre turnin around with the red light on here they come i sneaked a swivel through the rear glass he was right you could pipe that crimson spotlight stabbing the dimout and a siren started to growl they had me on the hook at last chapter vi the gambler my hacker romped on his throttle wanna race will it do any good i said hang onto your upper plate and well see he advised me and then he started doing some of the fanciest driving this side of the indianapolis speedway we took the next corner on squealing skins whammed north careened to the left at the following intersection and went rocketing westward like a comet with turpentine on its tail the speedometer needle crept around to the notch above sixty hung there a while and began climbing night wind screeched around our flapping fenders and the rear treads commenced to smoke the prowl car stayed with us what time is it the cabby asked me i braced myself tried to hang the focus on my strap watch not quite nine oclock does it matter yah he said narrowly missing a pedestrian on a crosswalk the pedestrian emitted an anguished wail jumped like a kangaroo and disappeared down an open manhole yah theres a street the water wagon always flushes around this time onight for another ten bucks i could maybe have a idea the tens yours i said i dont think youll ever live to spend it though he offered me odds of two to one sent the cab catapulting around another corner and gripped his wheel hard dead ahead i lamped a block where the asphalt was black and shiny from a recent wetting we barrelled onto this slippery stretch and made a sudden left turn into a narrow alley dont ask me how we pulled a bullseye for the life of me i dont know i bounced on the back seat like a pea in a dry pod felt the cabs rear end slewing slaunchwise hitting the mouth of that alley was like a palsied man threading a darning needle with a hunk of twoinch rope it just couldnt be done we did it the prowl chariot blammed into the wet block and tried to make the same maneuver goggling backward i saw it skid out of control and spin like a pinwheel it made three complete revolutions while the cops inside it screamed their tonsils to tatters then there was a thundering crash and a geyser of water fountained upward from a busted fireplug my cabby slackened speed as we emerged from the far end of the alley them bulls probably needed a bath anyhow he remarked now where you wanna go bud to a hospital i said weakly for a nervous breakdown he made clucking noises doctors wont do no good for what ails you hawkshaw what you need is a snifter he passed me a depleted pint it was rotgut rye but i drained it and it tasted like nectar presently my grey matter started functioning again i was almost back to normal i started counting on my fingers adding up what i knew concerning the things that had happened since maizie murdocks murder both roy cromwell and the little ballantyne blister had attempted to frame me and yet as the score stood now neither of them looked guilty of the actual kill okay could it have been some unknown character in the mob of extras and technical crew some guy whod had a personal beef against maizie and saw a chance to knock her off if so i was sunk hunted by the law how could i hope to ferret information regarding the hundred and fifty or more guys and wrens who had been on that amusement pier and besides the cops werent the only ones gunning for me there was that anonymous citizen who had fired a shot through the doorway of my stash missing me and nicking dave donaldson until now id almost forgotten this incident in the excitement of ensuing events in fact id paid very little attention to the matter from the outsetlargely because of the spot it put me in true the shot had given me a chance to make a getaway from dave but it had also made him think i was the trigger guy and this had deepened my jackpot to such an extent that i hadnt attempted to rationalise it in fact for a while id thought maybe the bullet had actually been meant for dave fired by a misguided friend trying to do me a favour now though i realised it could be viewed from a different angle suppose i had been the intended target of that slug suppose the gunsels aim had been bad so that he missed me and hit donaldson instead this new line of reasoning led me to something else suppose the baseball that conked maizie murdoch had likewise been meant for me it certainly had come close enough to my noggin maizie could have been just an innocent bystander bashed by accident the same as dave donaldson later was also accidentally nicked in his case it was a pill in maizies a baseball that was the only difference everything else meshed into an identical pattern and the pill had come from my own roscoe the one i had dropped on the venice amusement pier so now i was back on the same old merrygoround cromwell could have picked up my gat or bernie ballantyne either of them could have pitched the lethal baseball at the murdock cupcake too hitting her instead of me which one of them was the guy that thirsted to render me into a corpse cromwell didnt seem logical he had no reason to hate my clockworks as far as i knew in fact he was in my debt for the favour id done him the night i took vala duvalle off his hands in that night club raid the duvalle chick didnt fit the picture either id never done anything to earn her enmity and besides she was too fragile and dainty to heave a ball hard enough to burst a skull she didnt have the muscles but bernie ballantyne what the i said harshly the hacker looked back at me you feeling bad friend plenty bad i just thought of a guy who believed i was making a play for his sweetie he pretended to get over it later but maybe he still packed a secret grudge you dicks must have a lot of fun doping things out this one isnt funny i rasped the guy tried to bean me with a baseball he missed and it croaked a shemale whereupon he framed me for the kill youre sure of that i said reasonably sure i know a way to check it how i gave him vala duvalles address this side of beverly if i can make this bozos sweetie talk i may be able to cinch the thing she can tell me if he was still sore at me suppose she dont wanna talk though no jane likes to put her boy friend in the grease shell talk i blew on my mitts shell talk or ill bat the bicuspids out of her it wasnt late enough at night for a flunky to give me such a frigid gander i had thumbed the duvalle quails doorbell and waited easily three minutes before i thumbed it again now this liveried butler opened up and squinted at me as if id been something youd find under a rock miss duvalle he said to my polite query sorry my good man youre sorry for what really its ninethirty i said yeah pacific war time i asked for miss duvalle she has retired then trot her out of retirement i want her he drew himself up haughtily see here when you say that to me say see here sir i grabbed him by his boiled dickey how long has it been since you got poked on the trumpet why er never then he added sir i said youve missed an experience and educated him with my knuckles he fell down moaning that his nose was broken oddly enough he was right leaping lightly over his reclining form i ankled toward an ornate marble staircase and chased myself up to the second floor at a brisk trot the crash of the butlers fall and his piteous moans had preceded me however serving as a sort of storm warning when i reached vala duvalles room she was already at the door remember me toots i said mr tturner the same and pardon my warty exterior for barging in this way its impolite but necessary you beast she said i tried to look hurt thats no way to talk in the first place its inhospitable and in the second place they dont write that sort of dialogue any more too midvictorian get out she put her teeth together and talked through them get out before i call the police ill call them myself when the time comes i said right now i crave information not from me i dont associate with killers i debated whether to deal her a smack on the puss or try a little strategy first i tossed a mental coin and strategy won im not a killer hon i made my voice humble she peeled back her pomegranate lips liar im levelling honest i am give me a chance and ill prove it im trying to save my neck why should i care about your neck maybe you shouldnt but its the only one ive got and it fits all my collars i unlimbered my nicest smile meanwhile fishing for an angle as my hacker had remarked no jane likes to put her boy friend in the grease therefore i might not get very far if i came right out and asked this brunette doll about bernie ballantyne still being sore at me if i told her i suspected bernie himself of being the guilty guy she would congeal like frozen parsnips the thing to do was to sneak up on her do some verbal sparring until she dropped her guard then maybe id find out if bernie hated me so much he would pitch a baseball at me and bean somebody else by mistake i might learn if he was the one who had picked up my roscoe on the amusement pier later trying to plug me with it but nicking donaldson instead but what was the best approach all of a sudden a hunch nipped me look babe you know that trouble youve been having whwhat trouble the thing ballantyne asked you about and made you weep i said the same thing he hired me to investigate dont hold out on me im hep to the setup youre ttalking riddles yeah its a riddle when a cute little frail like you gets worried and draws a lot of dough out of her bank account for no logical reason its a shakedown riddle she sucked in a ragged breath turned four shades of pale backed toward her dressing table you unspeakable rat a cut glass perfume bottle was on the dresser she picked it up hurled it at me she tossed it with all her heft which was nothing to boast about it wabbled through the air almost lazily i didnt even bother to duck i just fielded it instead caught it with a casual left duke this stuff is expensive i reproached her it shouldnt be wasted on private snoops i put it back where she got it her angelic pan contorted darkly then she flurried into me kicking and scratching and panting i said so you want to fight and pinioned her every time she broke loose i grabbed her arms again presently she subsided whimpering i let her go apologised for the bruises and contusions on her elbows and upper arms i guess i just dont know my own strength i said but i was thinking of something elseand still planning my battle strategy get out she whispered not yet kitten ive got to know about that blackmailing as if you didnt i cocked an eyebrow sure i know youre being bled bernie knows it too you ttold him he told me i said he hired me to look into it her short laugh had an uneven quality like cloth being ripped what irony you mean him hiring me when he was jealous of me you know what i mean i said maybe im extra stupid tonight skip it about the shakedown geetus youve been paying what was it based on keep it up she grunted keep right on playing dumb was it somebody that piped you coming down from upstairs in pedro criquis joint with roy cromwell she gave me a sullen silent stare i said did this party threaten to squeal to bernie ballantyne which would have scuttled your engagement was that why you paid hush money her map was a defiant mask she didnt answer me look i said ive had a chinfest with pedro criqui hes told me the whole story what story about how you refused to stay in that room with a wolf like cromwell you know hon in many respects youre a naive dope she looked baffled i dont understand its very simple i said somebody put the nibble on you by threatening to tell bernie you were seen coming from a tryst with your director but why did you pay this shakedown when you were innocent she fell into the trap admitted she was being bled i had to pay i was innocent yes but whod believe me pedro criqui would have been happy to clear you you could have got him to explain how

sheepdip as far as i was concerned i didnt mean a word of it actually but it sounded plausible and i was trying to gain the janes confidence she fell for it too the filthy rotten heel yeah and to make it worse he shoved you off on me when the joint was raided that got bernie ballantyne sore at me i guess he still is hunh well aa little she admitted although he got over it pretty much i said the hell he did he even tried to frame me for the murdock fillys murder ohhh no i mean he really thinks you kkilled her hes sincere about it maybe youre right i shrugged it doesnt matter much i turned toward the door ill beat the rap one way or another in fact im going out to do that very thing right away be seeing you babe wait she said she came close to me stood on tiptoe and put her hands on my shoulders she kissed me it was a sisterly kiss thats for setting me straight on a lot of things she whispered shyly i ankled down to my taxi with my yap still tingling from the warm contact of her lips chapter vii the force of gravity at the nearest public phone i made three calls first i dialled roy cromwells stash asked a sleepy servant if the director was home the answer was yes so i hung up

youwh what i said yeah roy cromwell he needed a wad of scratch for his gambling debts so he lured her into a compromising situation she was strictly innocent understand but it looked bad on the surface then he put the bite on her again i was delivering a load of hogwash maliciously with a deliberate purpose the quarrelsome little paravox mogul stewed and sizzled audibly at the other end of the wire do you actually mean to tell me ive got the goods on him i lied and i know something else too i know who picked up my gat on the venice pier chew on that a while i rang off then finally i dialled police headquarters and asked for homicide is lieutenant donaldson there or did he go home to sulk over his skinned scalp hes here with a bandage that makes him look like a hindu whoever you

goodbye now im on my way to cromwells be seeing you there i disconnected and barged back to my cab the hacker said you look happy whats brewin an explosion i told him know how you make gunpowder no i buy mine readymade i said you pour in all the ingredients and stir them if you stir long enough ohoh you been stirrin the ingredients hunh i nodded gave him the cromwell bozos address lets ramble the kettle is starting to boil cromwells rambling spanish hacienda was pasted against the side of a hill north of hollywood boulevard just off one of the canyon drives we parked a block away and i hoofed the rest of the distance reached the directors driveway just as a sedan slid to a halt at the curb dave donaldson erupted from the sedan with a bandage around his cranium and two plainclothes minions flanking him the plainclothes minions had their roscoes out dave spotted me in the shadows there he is grab him i didnt think hed have nerve enough to show up freeze hawkshaw this time we take no chances with you you dont have to i said softly and allowed the flatties to fan me for my rod when they took it i added be careful how you handle that heater chums its the one that creased your superior officer dave snatched it so this is what you shot me with no well then whose gat is it mine aha so you confess i said its the one those venice coppers made me drop down on the amusement pier when they tried to collar me later the actual killer glommed it brought it back to hollywood and blasted from my doorway still sticking to that malarkey eh sure because its the truth are you going to stand jawing at me all night or can we go indoors for the payoff dave lifted a lip this is the payoff handcuff him men they nippered me and this time i stood still for it it was the third time id been taken in custody that day and i was much too weary to argue i merely said dont blame me when the case blows up in your kisser the next kill will be your fault think it over what next kill donaldson demanded suspiciously right here in cromwells shanty i sicced bernie ballantyne onto him a while ago by phone judging by the lights in the igloo and that chariot parked across the street cromwells got a visitor this instant dave cleared his throat and spat listen wisenheimer if youre pulling a swift one use your own judgment i said indifferently ive done my part its your picnic now he hesitated seemed to realise i was levelling come along with me he growled but the bracelets stay on you he turned to his underlings you guys wait here but lieutenant he snarled quiet and tugged me toward the directors portal shall i ring he whispered to me no try the knob he did its locked ive got master keys in my pocket fish them out and get to work with them i cant with these manacles he frisked me for the keys found one that operated the doorlatch now what inside fast and no noise i took the lead moving silently we came to an inside door that stood slightly ajar dim light glowed around it and low voices sounded in the room roy cromwell was panting all right i admit i was the blackmailer i needed cash desperately i you could have maced me senseless with an ostrich feather as i heard the guys confession my phoney accusations against him had turned out to be straight goods he really was the extortionist id fired a blind shot in the dark and scored the screwiest bullseye of my crazy career another voice husked hysterically you scum you pulled an unspeakable trick like that and caused me to commit murder but youre going to pay nopleasedont point that g gun at me this was my cue for action i slugged the door wide open so hard it nearly came loose from its moorings went leaping across the threshold with dave donaldson roaring in my wake i yodeled drop it vala duvalle the diminutive brunette cupcake had been aiming a tiny heater at roy cromwell who cowered in a far corner like a weasel in a trap but now she swung around hung the glassy focus on me tabbed donaldsons cannon making faces at her ohhh she whimpered faintly and let her roscoe clatter on the floor you you yeah i said regretfully remembering the kiss shed slipped me not long ago me hon just in time to keep you from another croaking and to hear you confess the maizie murdock bump im sorry baby i mean that her map was like a mask made of putty how did you how did you suspect your arms i said they gave you away donaldson yipped hey wait a minute whats this about her arms they look okay to me only they arent hefty enough to uncork a baseball pitch that could brain a jane i know it i said then how i stared moodily at vala you thought i was the blackmailer didnt you kitten yyes id made a crack in bernie ballantynes anteroom something about carrying tales to him if it paid me enough dividends since you were already being shaken down that made you think i was the mug who was putting the bite on you yyes her voice was dull lifeless i said you decided to croak me you tried to with that baseball but cooled maizie murdock by mistake when everybody called me guilty you let it ride thereby keeping your own skirts clean while still putting me in a coffin correct yyes she didnt seem to know any other word then i escaped i said you picked up my automatic tried to blast me with it later at my apartment drop again your aim was lousy you nicked lieutenant donaldson yyes she sounded like a victrola with a busted record i said well thats about all of it except your arms whwhat about them i called on you hoping to get the deadwood on bernie ballantyne at that time i had him tabbed as the guilty guy but suddenly i noticed the bruises and scrapes on your elbows i tumbled to the truth how she whispered ive got the same brand of bruises myself i told her and i remembered where id collected them the rest was easy i spoke of roy cromwell being the blackmailer figuring you would try to cream him the same as youd tried to bump me which you did and we caught you she blinked at me foggily the bruises from the giant slide i said whamming down the spiral tunnel was where you got your arms hurt just before the murder you rode the escalator to the observation tower on top of that amusement pier contraption the view platform looked directly down on the baseball concession you threw a ball at me from up there and gravity gave it murderspeed yyes she was back at that again i said as soon as you pitched the pill you slid down through the spiral dragon this landed you on the pier in plenty of time to establish an apparent alibi you said you had just come out of your dressing room nobody doubted you from behind me a new voice spoke high piping reedy it belonged to bernie ballantyne whod arrived to hear the payoff now he took vala in his arms ill hire the best lawyers in the world to defend you darling he said then he glared at cromwell youre fired you chiseling rat if you ever work in hollywood again itll be over my dead body he was a good prophet the duvalle cutie got off with a life sentence and roy cromwell got blackballed out of the galloping snapshots and dave donaldson actually paid dough out of his own pocket to have my jalopy brought back to me from where id ditched it in ocean park william faulkner when william faulkner a nobel laureate in literature turned his hand to writing an error in chemistry it was in response to the first shortstory contest held by ellery queens mystery magazine in faulkner wrote his story with the prize money in mind the pool of contestants was particularly talented faulkner tied with six others for second prize that faulkner went on to write five more stories collected in the anthology knights gambit and a novel intruder in the dust featuring series character uncle gavin stevens proves that the detective form has long attracted firstrate writers in the introduction to an error in chemistry in ellery queens mystery magazine queen compares faulkners strong moral sense with that of melville davisson post whether or not faulkner was acquainted with posts work is uncertain but queen is on the mark in pointing out the similarities between the two born william falkner he was to change the spelling of his name as a young man in new albany mississippi he was the greatgrandson of a colourful character william clark falkner who was a lawyer planter railroad builder novelist poet playwright and travel writer faulkner himself studied for two years at the university of mississippi served in world war i in both the canadian flying corps and the british royal air force worked at a number of jobs including postmaster and launched his literary career in with the marble faun a book of poetry he then began his long list of unforgettable novels about the corruption and decadence of southern values and southern families an error in chemistry offers a fascinating look at what a writer of faulkners calibre can do with a form thatwhen faulkner tried his hand at itwas still dominated by the depiction of ratiocination there is little doubt that faulkner had learned from earlier writers of detective fiction for example his use of uncle gavin stevens as a foil for the sheriffs thinking brings to mind dr john h watson and sherlock holmes the story begins with a puzzle focuses on it throughout and uses a clue that any reader can see to provide the solution but it is a superlative story because of its faulknerian qualitiesthe dark and twisted pride motivating the criminal the pathos the authentic sound of the dialogue the local colour and the provincial stage on which faulkner plays out his little drama from its thoughtprovoking title to the biblical references at its close an error in chemistry demonstrates that a tale of detection can rise to the level of true tragedy featuring as faulkner puts it that triumvirate of murderer victim and bereaved in faulkners hands murder is not merely the occasion to determine whodunit violent death gives substance to the victim an error in chemistry it was joel flint himself who telephoned the sheriff that he had killed his wife and when the sheriff and his deputy reached the scene drove the twentyodd miles into the remote backcountry region where old wesley pritchel lived joel flint himself met them at the door and asked them in he was the foreigner the outlander the yankee who had come into our county two years ago as the operator of a pitcha lighted booth where a roulette wheel spun against a bank of nickelplated pistols and razors and watches and harmonicas in a travelling street carnivaland who when the carnival departed had remained and two months later was married to pritchels only living child the dimwitted spinster of almost forty who until then had shared her irascible and violenttempered fathers almost hermitexistence on the good though small farm which he owned but even after the marriage old pritchel still seemed to draw the line against his soninlaw he built a new small house for them two miles from his own where the daughter was presently raising chickens for the market according to rumour old pritchel who hardly ever went anywhere anyway had never once entered the new house so that he saw even this last remaining child only once a week this would be when she and her husband would drive each sunday in the secondhand truck in which the soninlaw marketed the chickens to take sunday dinner with old pritchel in the old house where pritchel now did his own cooking and housework in fact the neighbours said the only reason he allowed the soninlaw to enter his house even then was so that his daughter could prepare him a decent hot meal once a week so for the next two years occasionally in jefferson the county seat but more frequently in the little crossroads hamlet near his home the soninlaw would be seen and heard too he was a man in the middle forties neither short nor tall nor thin nor stout in fact he and his fatherinlaw could easily have cast that same shadow which later for a short time they did with a cold contemptuous intelligent face and a voice lazy with anecdotes of the teeming outland which his listeners had never seena dweller among the cities though never from his own accounting long resident in any one of them who within the first three months of his residence among them had impressed upon the people whose way of life he had assumed one definite personal habit by which he presently became known throughout the whole county even by men who had never seen him this was a harsh and contemptuous derogation sometimes without even provocation or reason or opportunity of our local southern custom of drinking whiskey by mixing sugar and water with it he called it effeminacy a pap for children himself drinking even our harsh violent illicit and unaged homemade corn whiskey without even a sip of water to follow it then on this last sunday morning he telephoned the sheriff that he had killed his wife and met the officers at his fatherinlaws door and said i have already carried her into the house so you wont need to waste breath telling me i shouldnt have touched her until you got here i reckon it was all right to take her up out of the dirt the sheriff said it was an accident i believe you said then you believe wrong flint said i said i killed her and that was all the sheriff brought him to jefferson and locked him in a cell in the jail and that evening after supper the sheriff came through the side door into the study where uncle gavin was supervising me in the drawing of a brief uncle gavin was only county not district attorney but he and the sheriff who had been sheriff off and on even longer than uncle gavin had been county attorney had been friends all that while i mean friends in the sense that two men who play chess together are friends even though sometimes their aims are diametrically opposed i heard them discuss it once im interested in truth the sheriff said so am i uncle gavin said its so rare but i am more interested in justice and human beings aint truth and justice the same thing the sheriff said since when uncle gavin said in my time i have seen truth that was anything under the sun but just and i have seen justice using tools and instruments i wouldnt want to touch with a tenfoot fence rail the sheriff told us about the killing standing looming above the tablelampa big man with little hard eyes talking down at uncle gavins wild shock of prematurely white hair and his quick thin face while uncle gavin sat on the back of his neck practically his legs crossed on the desk chewing the bit of his corncob pipe and spinning and unspinning around his finger his watch chain weighted with the phi beta kappa key he got at harvard why uncle gavin said i asked him that myself the sheriff said he said why do men ever kill their wives call it for the insurance thats wrong uncle gavin said its women who murder their spouses for immediate personal gaininsurance policies or at what they believe is the instigation or promise of another man men murder their wives from hatred or rage or despair or to keep them from talking since not even bribery not even simple absence can bridle a womans tongue correct the sheriff said he blinked his little eyes at uncle gavin its like he wanted to be locked up in jail not like he was submitting to arrest because he had killed his wife but like he had killed her so that he would be locked up arrested guarded why uncle gavin said correct too the sheriff said when a man deliberately locks doors behind himself its because he is afraid and a man who would voluntarily have himself locked up on suspicion of murder he batted his hard little eyes at uncle gavin for a good ten seconds while uncle gavin looked just as hard back at him because he wasnt afraid not then nor at any time now and then you meet a man that aint ever been afraid not even of himself hes one if thats what he wanted you to do uncle gavin said why did you do it you think i should have waited a while they looked at one another a while uncle gavin wasnt spinning the watch chain now all right he said old man pritchel i was coming to that the sheriff said nothing nothing uncle gavin said you didnt even see him and the sheriff told that toohow as he and the deputy and flint stood on the gallery they suddenly saw the old man looking out at them through a windowa face rigid furious glaring at them through the glass for a second and then withdrawn vanished leaving an impression of furious exultation and raging triumph and something else fear the sheriff said no i tell you he wasnt afraidoh he said you mean pritchel this time he looked at uncle gavin so long that at last uncle gavin said all right go on and the sheriff told that too how they entered the house the hall and he stopped and knocked at the locked door of the room where they had seen the face and he even called old pritchels name and still got no answer and how they went on and found mrs flint on a bed in the back room with the shotgun wound in her neck and flints battered truck drawn up beside the back steps as if they had just got out of it there were three dead squirrels in the truck the sheriff said id say they had been shot since daylightand the blood on the steps and on the ground between the steps and the truck as if she had been shot from inside the truck and the gun itself still containing the spent shell standing just inside the hall door as a man would put it down when he entered the house and how the sheriff went back up the hall and knocked again at the locked door locked where uncle gavin said on the inside the sheriff saidand shouted against the doors blank surface that he would break the door in if mr pritchel didnt answer and open it and how this time the harsh furious old voice answered shouting get out of my house take that murderer and get out of my house you will have to make a statement the sheriff answered ill make my statement when the time comes for it the old man shouted get out of my house all of you and how he the sheriff sent the deputy in the car to fetch the nearest neighbour and he and flint waited until the deputy came back with a man and his wife then they brought flint on to town and locked him up and the sheriff telephoned back to old pritchels house and the neighbour answered and told him how the old man was still locked in the room refusing to come out or even to answer save to order them all several other neighbours had arrived by now word of the tragedy having spread to leave but some of them would stay in the house no matter what the seemingly crazed old man said or did and the funeral would be tomorrow and thats all uncle gavin said thats all the sheriff said because its too late now for instance uncle gavin said the wrong one is dead that happens uncle gavin said for instance that claypit business what claypit business because the whole county knew about old pritchels claypit it was a formation of malleable clay right in the middle of his farm of which people in the adjacent countryside made quite serviceable through crude potterythose times they could manage to dig that much of it before mr pritchel saw them and drove them off for generations indian and even aboriginal relicsflint arrowheads axes and dishes and skulls and thighbones and pipeshad been excavated from it by random boys and a few years ago a party of archaeologists from the state university had dug into it until old man pritchel got there this time with a shotgun but everybody knew this this was not what the sheriff was telling and now uncle gavin was sitting erect in the chair and his feet were on the floor now i hadnt heard about this uncle gavin said its common knowledge out there the sheriff said in fact you might call it the local outdoor sport it began about six weeks ago they are three northern men theyre trying to buy the whole farm from old pritchel to get the pit and manufacture some kind of road material out of the clay i understand the folks out there are still watching them trying to buy it apparently the northerners are the only folks in the country that dont know yet old pritchel aint got any notion of selling even the clay to them let alone the farm theyve made him an offer of course probably a good one it runs all the way from two hundred and fifty dollars to two hundred and fifty thousand depending on whos telling it them northerners just dont know how to handle him if they would just set in and convince him that everybody in the county is hoping he wont sell it to them they could probably buy it before supper tonight he stared at uncle gavin batting his eyes again so the wrong one is dead you see if it was that claypit hes no nearer to it than he was yesterday hes worse off than he was yesterday then there wasnt anything between him and his painlaws money but whatever private wishes and hopes and feelings that dimwitted girl might have had now theres a penitentiary wall and likely a rope it dont make sense if he was afraid of a possible witness he not only destroyed the witness before there was anything to be witnessed but also before there was any witness to be destroyed he set up a signboard saying watch me and mark me not just to this county and this state but to all folks everywhere who believe the book where it says thou shalt not killand then went and got himself locked up in the very place created to punish him for this crime and restrain him from the next one something went wrong i hope so uncle gavin said you hope so yes that something went wrong in what has already happened rather than what has already happened is not finished yet how not finished yet the sheriff said how can he finish whatever it is he aims to finish aint he already locked up in jail with the only man in the county who might make bond to free him being the father of the woman he as good as confessed he murdered it looks that way uncle gavin said was there an insurance policy i dont know the sheriff said ill find that out tomorrow but that aint what i want to know i want to know why he wanted to be locked up in jail because i tell you he wasnt afraid then nor at any other time you already guessed who it was out there that was afraid but we were not to learn that answer yet and there was an insurance policy but by the time we learned about that something else had happened which sent everything else temporarily out of mind at daylight the next morning when the jailer went and looked into flints cell it was empty he had not broken out he had walked out out of the cell out of the jail out of the town and apparently out of the countryno trace no sign no man who had seen him or seen anyone who might have been him it was not yet sunup when i let the sheriff in at the side study door uncle gavin was already sitting up in bed when we reached his bedroom old man pritchel uncle gavin said only we are already too late whats the matter with you the sheriff said i told you last night he was already too late the second he pulled that wrong trigger besides just to be in position to ease your mind ive already telephoned out there been a dozen folks in the house all night sitting up with thewith mrs flint and old pritchels still locked in his room and all right too they heard him bumping and blundering around in there just before daylight and so somebody knocked on the door and kept on knocking and calling him until he finally opened the door wide enough to give them all a good cussing and order them again to get out of his house and stay out then he locked the door again old fellows been hit pretty hard i reckon he must have seen it when it happened and at his age and having already druv the whole human race away from his house except that halfwit girl until at last even she up and left him even at any cost i reckon it aint any wonder she married even a man like flint what is it the book says who lives by the sword so shall he diethe sword in old pritchels case being whatever it was he decided he preferred in place of human beings while he was still young and hale and strong and didnt need them but to keep your mind easy i sent bryan ewell out there thirty minutes ago and told him not to let that locked dooror old pritchel himself if he comes out of itout of his sight until i told him to and i sent ben berry and some others out to flints house and told ben to telephone me and ill call you when i hear anything which wont be anything because that fellows gone he got caught yesterday because he made a mistake and the fellow that can walk out of that jail like he did aint going to make two mistakes within five hundred miles of jefferson or mississippi either mistake uncle gavin said he just told us this morning why he wanted to be put in jail and why was that so he could escape from it and why get out again when he was already out and could have stayed out by just running instead of telephoning me he had committed a murder i dont know uncle gavin said are you sure old man pritchel didnt i just tell you folks saw and talked to him through that halfopened door this morning and bryan ewell probably sitting in a chair tilted against that door right this minuteor he better be ill telephone you if i hear anything but ive already told you that toothat it wont be nothing he telephoned an hour later he had just talked to the deputy who had searched flints house reporting only that flint had been there sometime in the nightthe back door open an oil lamp shattered on the floor where flint had apparently knocked it while fumbling in the dark since the deputy found behind a big open hurriedly ransacked trunk a twisted spill of paper which flint had obviously used to light his search of the trunka scrap of paper torn from a billboard a what uncle gavin said thats what i said the sheriff said and ben says all right then send somebody else out here if my reading aint good enough to suit you it was a scrap of paper which was evidently tore from the corner of a billboard because it says on the scrap in english that even i can readand i says tell me exactly what it is youre holding in your hand and he did its a page from a magazine or a small paper named billboard or maybe the billboard theres some more printing on it but ben cant read it because he lost his spectacles back in the woods while he was surrounding the house to catch flint doing whatever it was he expected to catch him doingcooking breakfast maybe do you know what it is yes uncle gavin said do you know what it means what it was doing there yes uncle gavin said but why well i cant tell you and he never will because hes gone gavin oh well catch himsomebody will i mean someday somewhere but it wont be here and it wont be for this its like that poor harmless halfwitted girl wasnt important enough for even that justice you claim you prefer above truth to avenge her and that did seem to be all of it mrs flint was buried that afternoon the old man was still locked in his room during the funeral and even after they departed with the coffin for the churchyard leaving in the house only the deputy in his tilted chair outside the locked door and two neighbour women who remained to cook a hot meal for old pritchel finally prevailing on him to open the door long enough to take the tray from them and he thanked them for it clumsily and gruffly thanking them for their kindness during all the last twentyfour hours one of the women was moved enough to offer to return tomorrow and cook another meal for him whereupon his oldtime acerbity and choler returned and the kindhearted woman was even regretting that she had made the offer at all when the harsh cracked old voice from inside the halfclosed door added i dont need no help i aint had no darter nohow in two years and the door slammed in their faces and the bolt shot home then the two women left and there was only the deputy sitting in his tilted chair beside the door he was back in town the next morning telling how the old man had snatched the door suddenly open and kicked the chair out from beneath the dozing deputy before he could move and ordered him off the place with violent curses and how as he the deputy peered at the house from around the corner of the barn a short time later the shotgun blared from the kitchen window and the charge of squirrel shot slammed into the stable wall not a yard above his head the sheriff telephoned that to uncle gavin too so hes out there alone again and since thats what he seems to want its all right with me sure i feel sorry for him i feel sorry for anybody that has to live with a disposition like his old and alone to have all this happen to him its like being snatched up by a tornado and whirled and slung and then slammed right back down where you started from without even the benefit and pleasure of having taken a trip what was it i said yesterday about living by the sword i dont remember uncle gavin said you said a lot yesterday and a lot of it was right i said it was finished yesterday and it is that fellow will trip himself again someday but it wont be here only it was more than that it was as if flint had never been here at allno mark no scar to show that he had ever been in the jail cell the meagre group of people who pitied but did not mourn departing separating from the raw grave of the woman who had had little enough hold on our lives at best whom a few of us had known without ever having seen her and some of us had seen without ever knowing her the childless old man whom most of us had never seen at all once more alone in the house where as he said himself there had been no child anyway in two years as though none of it had ever happened uncle gavin said as if flint had not only never been in that cell but had never existed at all that triumvirate of murderer victim and bereavednot three fleshandblood people but just an illusion a shadowplay on a sheetnot only neither men nor women nor young nor old but just three labels which cast two shadows for the simple and only reason that it requires a minimum of two in order to postulate the verities of injustice and grief thats it they have never cast but two shadows even though they did bear three labels names it was as though only by dying did that poor woman ever gain enough substance and reality even to cast a shadow but somebody killed her i said yes uncle gavin said somebody killed her that was at noon about five that afternoon i answered the telephone it was the sheriff is your uncle there he said tell him to wait im coming right over he had a stranger with hima city man in neat city clothes this is mr workman the sheriff said the adjuster there was an insurance policy for five hundred taken out seventeen months ago hardly enough to murder anybody for if it ever was a murder the adjuster said his voice was cold too cold yet at the same time at a sort of seething boil that policy will be paid at once without question or any further investigation and ill tell you something else you people here dont seem to know yet that old man is crazy it was not the man flint who should have been brought to town and locked up only it was the sheriff who told that too how yesterday afternoon the insurance companys memphis office had received a telegram signed with old man pritchels name notifying them of the insureds death and the adjuster arrived at old man pritchels house about two oclock this afternoon and within thirty minutes had extracted from old man pritchel himself the truth about his daughters death the facts of it which the physical evidencethe truck and the three dead squirrels and the blood on the steps and on the groundsupported this was that while the daughter was cooking dinner pritchel and flint had driven the truck down to pritchels woods lot to shoot squirrels for supperand thats correct the sheriff said i asked they did that every sunday morning pritchel wouldnt let anybody but flint shoot his squirrels and he wouldnt even let flint shoot them unless he was alongand they shot the three squirrels and flint drove the truck back to the house and up beside the back steps and the woman came out to take the squirrels and flint opened the door and picked up the gun to get out of the truck and stumbled caught his heel on the edge of the runningboard and flinging up the hand carrying the gun to break his fall so that the muzzle of the gun was pointing right at his wifes head when it went off and old man pritchel not only denied having sent the wire he violently and profanely repudiated any and all implication or suggestion that he even knew the policy existed at all he denied to the very last that the shooting had been any part of an accident he tried to revoke his own testimony as to what had happened when the daughter came out to get the dead squirrels and the gun went off repudiating his own story when he realised that he had cleared his soninlaw of murder snatching the paper from the adjusters hand which he apparently believed was the policy itself and attempting to tear it up and destroy it before the adjuster could stop him why uncle gavin said why not the sheriff said we had let flint get away mr pritchel knew he was loose somewhere in the world do you reckon he aimed to let the man that killed his daughter get paid for it maybe uncle gavin said but i dont think so i dont think he is worried about that at all i think mr pritchel knows that joel flint is not going to collect that policy or any other prize maybe he knew a little country jail like ours wasnt going to hold a widetravelled excarnival man and he expected flint to come back out there and this time he was ready for him and i think that as soon as people stop worrying him he will send you word to come out there and he will tell you so hah the adjuster said then they must have stopped worrying him listen to this when i got there this afternoon there were three men in the parlour with him they had a certified check it was a big check they were buying his farm from himlock stock and barreland i didnt know land in this country was worth that much either incidentally he had the deed all drawn and signed but when i told them who i was they agreed to wait until i could get back to town here and tell somebodythe sheriff probably and i left and that old lunatic was still standing in the door shaking that deed at me and croaking tell the sheriff damn you get a lawyer too get that lawyer stevens i hear tell he claims to be pretty slick we thank you the sheriff said he spoke and moved with that deliberate slightly florid oldfashioned courtesy which only big men can wear except that his was constant this was the first time i ever saw him quit anyone shortly even when he would see them again tomorrow he didnt even look at the adjuster again my cars outside he told uncle gavin so just before sunset we drove up to the neat picket fence enclosing old man pritchels neat bare little yard and neat tight little house in front of which stood the big dustcovered car with its city license plates and flints battered truck with a strange negro youth at the wheelstrange because old man pritchel had never had a servant of any sort save his daughter hes leaving too uncle gavin said thats his right the sheriff said we mounted the steps but before we reached the door old man pritchel was already shouting for us to come inthe harsh cracked old mans voice shouting at us from beyond the hall beyond the door to the dining room where a tremendous oldfashioned telescope bag strapped and bulging sat on a chair and the three northerners in dusty khaki stood watching the door and old man pritchel himself sat at the table and i saw for the first time uncle gavin told me he had seen him only twice the uncombed thatch of white hair a fierce tangle of eyebrows above steelframed spectacles a jut of untrimmed moustache and a scrabble of beard stained with chewing tobacco to the colour of dirty cotton come in he said that lawyer stevens heh yes mr pritchel the sheriff said hehm the old man barked well hub he said can i sell my land or cant i of course mr pritchel the sheriff said we hadnt heard you aimed to heh the old man said maybe this changed my mind the check and the folded deed both lay on the table in front of him he pushed the check toward the sheriff he didnt look at uncle gavin again he just said you too uncle gavin and the sheriff moved to the table and stood looking down at the check neither of them touched it i could see their faces there was nothing in them well mr pritchel said its a good price the sheriff said this time the old man said hah short and harsh he unfolded the deed and spun it to face not the sheriff but uncle gavin well he said you lawyer its all right mr pritchel uncle gavin said the old man sat back both hands on the table before him his head tilted back as he looked up at the sheriff well he said fish or cut bait its your land the sheriff said what you do with it is no mans business else hah mr pritchel said he didnt move all right gentlemen he didnt move at all one of the strangers came forward and took up the deed ill be out of the house in thirty minutes you can take possession then or you will find the key under the mat tomorrow morning i dont believe he even looked after them as they went out though i couldnt be sure because of the glare on his spectacles then i knew that he was looking at the sheriff had been looking at him for a minute or more and then i saw that he was trembling jerking and shaking as the old tremble although his hands on the table were as motionless as two lumps of the clay would have been so you let him get away he said thats right the sheriff said but you wait mr pritchel well catch him when the old man said two years five years ten years i am seventyfour years old buried my wife and four children where will i be in ten years here i hope the sheriff said here the old man said didnt you just hear me tell that fellow he could have this house in thirty minutes i own a automobile truck now i got money to spend now and something to spend it for spend it for what the sheriff said that check even this boy here would have to start early and run late to get shut of that much money in ten years spend it running down the man that killed my ellie he rose suddenly thrusting his chair back he staggered but when the sheriff stepped quickly toward him he flung his arm out and seemed actually to strike the sheriff back a pace let be he said panting then he said harsh and loud in his cracked shaking voice get out of here get out of my house all of you but the sheriff didnt move nor did we and after a moment the old man stopped trembling but he was still holding to the table edge but his voice was quiet hand me my whiskey on the sideboard and three glasses the sheriff fetched theman oldfashioned cutglass decanter and three heavy tumblersand set them before him and when he spoke this time his voice was almost gentle and i knew what the woman had felt that evening when she offered to come back tomorrow and cook another meal for him youll have to excuse me im tired ive had a heap of trouble lately and i reckon im wore out maybe a change is what i need but not tonight mr pritchel the sheriff said and then again as when the woman had offered to come back and cook he ruined it maybe i wont start tonight he said and then maybe again i will but you folks want to get on back to town so well just drink to goodbye and better days he unstoppered the decanter and poured whiskey into the three tumblers and set the decanter down and looked about the table you boy he said hand me the water bucket its on the back gallery shelf then as i turned and started toward the door i saw him reach and take up the sugar bowl and plunge the spoon into the sugar and then i stopped too and i remember uncle gavins and the sheriffs faces and i could not believe my eyes either as he put the spoonful of sugar into the raw whiskey and started to stir it because i had not only watched uncle gavin and the sheriff when he would come to play chess with uncle gavin but uncle gavins father too who was my grandfather and my own father before he died and all the other men who would come to grandfathers house who drank cold toddies as we call them and even i knew that to make a cold toddy you do not put the sugar into the whiskey because sugar will not dissolve in raw whiskey but only lies in a little intact swirl like sand at the bottom of the glass that you first put the water into the glass and dissolve the sugar into the water in a ritual almost then you add the whiskey and that anyone like old man pritchel who must have been watching men make cold toddies for nearly seventy years and had been making and drinking them himself for at least fiftythree would know this too and i remember how the man we had thought was old man pritchel realised too late what he was doing and jerked his head up just as uncle gavin sprang toward him and swung his arm back and hurled the glass at uncle gavins head and the thud of the flung glass against the wall and the dark splash it made and the crash of the table as it went over and the raw stink of the spilled whiskey from the decanter and uncle gavin shouting at the sheriff grab him hub grab him then we were all three on him i remember the savage strength and speed of the body which was no old mans body i saw him duck beneath the sheriffs arm and the entire wig came off i seemed to see his whole face wrenching itself furiously free from beneath the makeup which bore the painted wrinkles and the false eyebrows when the sheriff snatched the beard and moustache off the flesh seemed to come with it springing quick and pink and then crimson as though in that last desperate cast he had had to beard disguise not his face so much as the very blood which he had spilled it took us only thirty minutes to find old mr pritchels body it was under the feed room in the stable in a shallow and hurried trench scarcely covered from sight his hair had not only been dyed it had been trimmed the eyebrows trimmed and dyed too and the moustache and beard shaved off he was wearing the identical garments which flint had worn to the jail and he had been struck at least one crushing blow on the face apparently with the flat of the same axe which had split his skull from behind so that his features were almost unrecognisable and after another two or three weeks underground would perhaps have been even unidentifiable as those of the old man and pillowed carefully beneath the head was a big ledger almost six inches thick and weighing almost twenty pounds and filled with the carefully pasted clippings which covered twenty years and more it was the record and tale of the gift the talent which at the last he had misapplied and betrayed and which had then turned and destroyed him it was all there inception course peak and then declinethe handbills the theatre programs the news clippings and even one actual tenfoot poster signor canova master of illusion he disappears while you watch him management offers one thousand dollars in cash to any man or woman or child who last of all was the final clipping from our memphisprinted daily paper under the jefferson date line which was news and not pressagentry this was the account of that last gamble in which he had cast his gift and his life against money wealth and lostthe clipped fragment of newssheet which recorded the end not of one life but of three though even here two of them cast but one shadow not only that of the harmless dimwitted woman but of joel flint and signer canova too with scattered among them and marking the date of that death too the cautiously worded advertisements in variety and billboard using the new changed name and no takers probably since signer canova the great was already dead then and already serving his purgatory in this circus for six months and that circus for eightbandsman ringman bornean wild man down to the last stage where he touched bottom the travelling from country town to country town with a roulette wheel wired against imitation watches and pistols which would not shoot until one day instinct perhaps showed him one more chance to use the gift again and lost this time for good the sheriff said we were in the study again beyond the open side door fireflies winked and drifted across the summer night and the crickets and treefrogs cheeped and whirred it was that insurance policy if that adjuster hadnt come to town and sent us back out there in time to watch him try to dissolve sugar in raw whiskey he would have collected that check and taken that truck and got clean away instead he sends for the adjuster then he practically dares you and me to come out there and see past that wig and paint you said something the other day about his destroying his witness too soon uncle gavin said she wasnt his witness the witness he destroyed was the one we were supposed to find under that feed room witness to what the sheriff said to the fact that joel flint no longer existed partly but mostly to the first crime the old one the one in which signer canova died he intended for that witness to be found thats why he didnt bury it hide it better and deeper as soon as somebody found it he would be at once and forever not only rich but free free not only of signer canova who had betrayed him by dying eight years ago but of joel flint too even if we had found it before he had a chance to leave what would he have said he ought to have battered the face a little more the sheriff said i doubt it uncle gavin said what would he have said all right the sheriff said what yes i killed him he murdered my daughter and what would you have said being as you are the law nothing the sheriff said after a time nothing uncle gavin said a dog was barking somewhere not a big dog and then a screechowl flew into the mulberry tree in the back yard and began to cry plaintive and tremulous and all the little furred creatures would be moving nowthe field mice the possums and rabbits and foxes and the legless vertebratescreeping or scurrying about the dark land which beneath the rainless summer stars was just dark not desolate thats one reason he did it uncle gavin said one reason the sheriff said whats the other the other is the real one it had nothing to do with the money he probably could not have helped obeying it if he had wanted to that gift he had his first regret right now is probably not that he was caught but that he was caught too soon before the body was found and he had the chance to identify it as his own before signer canova had had time to toss his gleaming tophat vanishing behind him and bow to the amazed and stormlike staccato of adulant palms and turn and stride once or twice and then himself vanish from the pacing spotlightgone to be seen no more think what he did he convicted himself of murder when he could very likely have escaped by flight he acquitted himself of it after he was already free again then he dared you and me to come out there and actually be his witnesses and guarantors in the consummation of the very act which he knew we had been trying to prevent what else could the possession of such a gift as his have engendered and the successful practising of it have increased but a supreme contempt for mankind you told me yourself that he had never been afraid in his life yes the sheriff said the book itself says somewhere know thyself aint there another book somewhere that says man fear thyself thine arrogance and vanity and pride you ought to know you claim to be a book man didnt you tell me thats what that luckcharm on your watch chain means what book is that in its in all of them uncle gavin said the good ones i mean its said in a lot of different ways but its there clayton rawson the mystery writer is often described as an entertainer who possesses a bag of tricks inside the bag are devices designed to deceive sleights of hand least likely suspects and apparently impossible situations like locked rooms any writer can play with these tricks in a workaday manner any hack can pull the wool over readers eyes but clayton rawson proved that the mystery writer who has actual experience as a working magician can trick readers even while urging them to keep their eyes wide open in so doing rawson demonstrated that he could work magic on the page as well as on the stage under the stage and pen name the great merlini rawson earned the admiration of the best magicians mystery writers and mystery editors in the business born in elyria ohio he graduated from ohio state university and then studied at the chicago art institute before beginning his multiple careers as performing magician inventor of magic tricks

schuster in the mids his great merlini stories began to appear in ellery queens mystery magazine where they were first published without solutions so that readers could compete to solve them rawson eventually became the managing editor of that magazine in four novels and a dozen short stories featuring the great merlini the magiciansleuth uses his expertise to see through the misleading clues that dumbfound the police not only are the solutions discovered through the magicians skills but the clues themselves are laid out with a professional awareness of how to deceive the reader as from another world ably demonstrates from another world it was undoubtedly one of the worlds strangest rooms the oldfashioned rolltop desk the battered typewriter and the steel filing cabinet indicated that it was an office there was even a calendar memo pad a pen and pencil set and an overflowing ashtray on the desk but any resemblance to any other office stopped right there the desk top also held a pair of handcuffs half a dozen billiard balls a shiny nickelplated revolver one celluloid egg several decks of playing cards a bright green silk handkerchief and a stack of unopened mail in one corner of the room stood a large galvanizediron milk can with a strait jacket lying on its top a feathered devil mask from the upper congo leered down from the wall and the entire opposite wall was papered with a ringling bros and barnum bailey twentyfour sheet poster a loosejointed dummy figure of a small boy with popeyes and violently red hair lay on the filing cabinet together with a skull and a fishbowl filled with paper flowers and in the cabinets bottom drawer which was partly open and lined with paper there was one halfeaten carrot and a twinklynosed live white rabbit a pile of magazines topped by a french journal illlusioniste was stacked precariously on a chair and a large bookcase tried vainly to hold an even larger flood of books that overflowed and formed dusty stalagmites growing up from the floorbooks whose authors would have been startled at the company they kept shaws saint joan was sandwiched between rowans story of the secret service and the memoirs of robert houdin arthur machen dr hans gross william blake sir james jeans rebecca west robert louis stevenson and ernest hemingway were bounded on either side by devols forty years a gambler on the mississippi and reginald scotts discoverie of witchcraft the merchandise in the shop beyond the office had a similar surrealist quality but the inscription on the glass of the outer door although equally strange did manage to supply an explanation it read miracles for salethe magic shop a merlini prop and that gentleman naturally was just as unusual as his place of business for one thing he hadnt put a foot in it to my knowledge in at least a week when he finally did reappear i found him at the desk sleepily and somewhat glumly eying the unopened mail he greeted me as though he hadnt seen another human being in at least a month and the swivel chair creaked as he settled back in it put his long legs up on the desk and yawned then he indicated the card bearing his business slogannothing is impossiblewhich was tacked on the wall i may have to take that sign down he said lazily ive just met a theatrical producer a scene designer and a playwright all of whom are quite impossible they came in here a week before opening night and asked me to supply several small items mentioned in the script in one scene a character said begone and the stage directions read the genie and his six dancing girl slaves vanish instantly later an elephant complete with howdah and princess disappeared the same way i had to figure out how to manage all that and cook up a few assorted miracles for the big scene in heaven too then i spent thirtysix hours in bed and im still half asleep he grinned wryly and added ross if you want anything that is not a stock item you can whistle for it i dont want a miracle i said just an interview what do you know about esp and pk too much he said youre doing another magazine article yes and ive spent the last week with a queer assortment of characters toohalf a dozen psychologists some professional gamblers a nuclear physicist the secretary of the psychical research society and a neurologist ive got an appointment in half an hour with a millionaire and after that i want to hear what you think of it you interviewed dr rhine at duke university of course i nodded sure he started it all he says hes proved conclusively that there really are such things as telepathy mind reading clairvoyance xray vision and probably crystal gazing as well he wraps it all up in one package and calls it espmeaning extrasensory perception that merlini said is not the half of it his psychokinesis or pk for short is positively miraculousand frightening the magician pulled several issues of the journal of parapsychology from the stack of magazines and upset the whole pile if the conclusions rhine has published here are correctif there really is a tangible mental force that can not only reach out and influence the movements of dice but exert its mysterious control over other physical objects as wellthen he has completely upset the apple cart of modern psychology and punctured a whole library of general scientific theory as well hes already upset me i said i tried to use pk in a crap game saturday night i lost sixtyeight bucks my scepticism didnt disturb merlini he went right on gloomier than ever if rhine is right his esp and pk have reopened the pandoras box in which science thought it had forever sealed voodooand witchcraft and enough other practices of primitive magic to make your hair stand on end and youre growling about losing a few dollars behind me a hearty familiar voice said i havent got anything to worry about except a homicidal maniac who has killed three people in the last two days and left absolutely no clues but can i come in inspector homer gavigan of the new york city police department stood in the doorway his blue eyes twinkling frostily merlini liking the cassandra role he was playing said sure ive been waiting for you but dont think that pk wont give you a splitting headache too all a murderer would have to do to commit the perfect crimeand a locked room one at thatwould be to exert his psychokinetic mental force from a distance against the gun trigger he pointed at the revolver on the desk like this gavigan and i both saw the trigger with no finger on it move bang the guns report was like a thunderclap in the small room i knew well enough that it was only a stage prop and the cartridge a blank but i jumped a foot so did gavigan look dammit the inspector exploded how did you the great merlini grinned he was fully awake now and enjoying himself hugely no he said that wasnt pk luckily just ordinary runofthemill conjuring the rising cards and the talking skull are both sometimes operated the same way you can have the secret at the usual catalogue price of like most policemen gavigan had a healthy respect for firearms and he was still jumpy i dont want to buy either of them he growled do we have a date for dinneror dont we im starved we do merlini said pulling his long lean self up out of the chair and reaching for his coat can you join us ross i shook my head not this time ive got a date just now with andrew drake in the elevator merlini gave me an odd look and asked andrew drake what has he got to do with esp and pk what doesnt he have something to do with i replied six months ago it was the drake plan to outlaw war he tried to take over the un singlehanded two months ago he announced he was setting up a million research foundation to find a cancer cure in six months polish it off like we did the atom bomb he says put in enough money and you can accomplish anything now hes head over heels in esp with some yoga mixed in unleash the power of the human mind and solve all our problems just like that so thats what hes up to merlini said as we came out on to fortysecond street a block from times square to face a bitterly cold january wind i wondered then as he followed gavigan into the official car that waited and left me shivering on the curb he threw a last cryptic sentence over his shoulder when drake mentions rosa rhys he said you might warn him that hes heading for trouble merlini didnt know how right he was if any of us had had any clairvoyant ability at all i wouldnt have taken a cab up to drakes all three of us would have gone in gavigans car and with the siren going full blast as it was i stepped out all alone in front of the big ninetyeighth street house just off riverside drive it was a sixtyyearold mansion built in the tortured style that had been the height of architectural fashion in the s but was now a smokeblackened monstrosity as coldly depressing as the weather i nearly froze both ears just getting across the pavement and up the steps where i found a doctor with his finger gluedor frozen perhapsto the bell push a doctor no it wasnt esp a copy of the ama journal stuck out of his overcoat pocket and his left hand carried the customary small black case but he didnt have the medical mans usual clinical detachment this doctor was jumpy as hell when i asked anything wrong his head jerked around and his pale blue eyes gave me a startled look he was a thin welldressed man in his early forties yes he said crisply im afraid so he jabbed a long forefinger at the bell again just as the door opened at first i didnt recognise the girl who looked out at us when i had seen her by daylight earlier in the week i had tagged her as in the brainybutabitplain category a judgment i revised somewhat now considering what the charles hairdo and hattie carnegie dress did for her oh hello doctor she said come in the doctor began talking even before he crossed the threshold your father elinoris he still in the study yes i think so but what she stopped because he was already gone running down the hall toward a door at its end he rattled the doorknob then rapped loudly mr drake let me in the girl looked puzzled then frightened her dark eyes met mine for an instant and then her high heels clicked on the polished floor as she too ran down the hall i didnt wait to be invited i followed the doctors knuckles rapped again on the door miss rhys he called its dr garrett unlock the door there was no answer garrett tried the doorknob once more then threw his shoulder against the door it didnt move elinor do you have a key we must get in therequickly she said no father has the only keys why dont they answer whats wrong i dont know garrett said your father phoned me just now he was in pain he said hurry i need you imthe doctor hesitated watching the girl then he finished dyingafter thatno answer garrett turned to me youve got more weight than i have think you can break this door in i looked at it the door seemed solid enough but it was an old house and the wood around the screws that held the lock might give i dont know i said ill try elinor drake moved to one side and the doctor stepped behind me i threw myself against the door twice and the second time felt it move a bit then i hit it hard just as the door gave way i heard the tearing sound of paper but before i could discover what caused that my attention was held by more urgent matters i found myself staring at a greenshaded desk lamp the rooms only source of light at the overturned phone on the desk top and at the sprawled shape that lay on the floor in front of the desk a coppery highlight glinted on a letter opener near the mans feet its blade was discoloured with a dark wet stain dr garrett said elinor you stay out as he moved past me to the body and bent over it one of his hands lifted andrew drakes right eyelid the other felt his wrist i have never heard a ghost speak but the sound that came then was exactly what i would expecta low quivering moan shot with pain i jerked around and saw a glimmer of white move in the darkness on my left behind me elinors whisper a tense thread of sound said lights as she clicked the switch by the door the glow from the ceiling fixture overhead banished both the darkness and the spectrebut what remained was almost as unlikely a chair lay overturned on the carpet next to a small table that stood in the centre of the room in a second chair slumped forward with her head resting on the tabletop was the body of a woman she was young darkhaired rather goodlooking and had an excellent figure this latter fact was instantly apparent becauseand i had to look twice before i could believe what i sawshe wore a brief skintight onepiece bathing suit nothing else elinors eyes were still on the sprawled shape on the floor father hesdead garrett nodded slowly and stood up i heard the quick intake of her breath but she made no other sound then garrett strode quickly across to the woman at the table unconscious he said after a moment apparently a blow on the headbut shes beginning to come out of it he looked again at the knife on the floor well have to call the police i hardly heard him i was wondering why the room was so bare the hall outside and the living room that opened off it were furnished with the stiff formal ostentation of the overly rich but drakes study by contrast was as sparsely furnished as a cell in a trappist monastery except for the desk the small table the two chairs and a threeleaf folding screen that stood in one corner it contained no other furniture there were no pictures on the walls no papers and although there were shelves for them no books there wasnt even a blotter or pen on the desk top nothing but the phone desk lamp and strangely enough a roll of gummed paper tape but i only glanced at these things briefly it was the large casement window in the wall behind the desk that held my attentiona dark rectangle beyond which like a scattered handful of bright jewels were the lights of new jersey and above them frosty pinpoints of stars shining coldly in a black sky the odd thing was that the windows centre line where its two halves joined was crisscrossed by twofoot strips of brown paper tape pasted to the glass the window was quite literally sealed shut it was then that i remembered the sound of tearing paper as the lock had given way and the door had come open i turned elinor still stood theremotionless and on the inside of the door and on the jamb were more of the paper strips four were torn in half two others had been pulled loose from the wall and hung curled from the doors edge at that moment a brisk energetic voice came from the hall how come you leave the front door standing wide open on the coldest day in elinor turned to face a broadshouldered young man with wavy hair handpainted tie and a completely selfassured manner she said paul then took one stumbling step and was in his arms he blinked at her hey whats wrong then he saw what lay on the floor by the desk his selfconfidence sagged dr garrett moved to the door kendrick he said take elinor out of here ill no it was elinors voice she straightened up turned suddenly and started into the room but paul caught her where are you going she tried to pull away from him im going to phone the police her eyes followed the trail of bloodstains that led from the body across the beige carpet to the overturned chair and the woman at the table shekilled him that was when i started for the phone myself but i hadnt taken more than two steps when the woman in the bathing suit let out a hairraising shriek she was gripping the table with both hands her eyes fixed on drakes body with the rigid unblinking stare of a figure carved from stone then suddenly her body trembled all over and she opened her mouth againbut garrett got there first he slapped her on the side of the facehard it stopped the scream but the horror still filled her round dark eyes and she still stared at the body as though it were some demon straight from hell hysteria garrett said then seeing me start again toward the phone get an ambulance too and when he spoke to paul kendrick this time it was an order and get elinor out of herequickly elinor drake was looking at the girl in the bathing suit with wide puzzled eyes sheshe killed him why paul nodded he turned elinor around gently but swiftly and led her out the cops usually find too many fingerprints on a phone none of them any good because they are superimposed on each other but i handled the receiver carefully just the same picking it up by one end when headquarters answered i gave the operator the facts fast then asked him to locate inspector gavigan and have him call me back i gave drakes number as i talked i watched dr garrett open his black case and take out a hypodermic syringe he started to apply it to the womans arm just as i hung up whats that doc i asked sedative otherwise shell be screaming again in a minute the girl didnt seem to feel the needle as it went in then noticing two bright spots of colour on the table i went across to examine them closely and felt more than ever as though i had stepped straight into a surrealist painting i was looking at two rounded conical shapes each about two inches in length both were striped like candy canes one in maroon against a white background the other in thinner brilliant red stripes against an opalescent amber did drake i asked collect seashells too no garrett scowled in a worried way at the shells but i once did these are molluscs but not from the sea cochlostyla a tree snail habitat the philippines he turned his scowl from the shells to me by the way just who are you the name is ross harte i added that i had had an appointment to interview drake for a magazine article and then asked why is this room sealed as it is why is this girl dressed only in apparently like many medical men garrett took a dim view of reporters ill make my statement he said a bit stiffly to the police they arrived a moment later two uniformed prowlcar cops first then the precinct boys and after that at intervals the homicide squad an ambulance intern a fingerprint man and photographer the medical examiner an assistant d a and later because a millionaire rates more attention than the victim of a harlem stabbing the d a himself and an assistant chief inspector even looked in for a few minutes of the earlier arrivals the only familiar face was that of the homicide squads lieutenant dorana hardboiled coldly efficient nononsense cop who had so little use for reporters that i suspected he had once been bitten by one at dr garretts suggestion which the intern seconded the girl in the bathing suit was taken under guard to the nearest hospital then garrett and i were put on ice also under guard in the living room another detective ushered paul kendrick into the room a moment later he scowled at dr garrett we all thought rosa rhys was bad medicine but i never expected anything like this why would she want to kill him it doesnt make sense selfdefence i suggested could he have made a pass at her and kendrick shook his head emphatically not that gal she was making a fast play for the old manand his money a pass would have been just what she wanted he turned to garrett what were they doing in theremore esp experiments the doctor laid his overcoat neatly over the back of an ornate spanish chair his voice sounded tired and defeated no they had gone beyond that i told him that she was a fraud but you know how drake wasalways so absolutely confident that he couldnt be wrong about anything he said hed put her through a test that would convince all of us of what i asked what was it she claimed she could do the detective at the door moved forward my orders he said are that youre not to talk about what happened until after the lieutenant has taken your statements make it easy for me will you that made it difficult for us any other conversational subject just then seemed pointless we sat there silent and uncomfortable but somehow the nervous tension that had been in our voices was still therea foreboding ghostly presence waiting with us for what was to happen next a half hour later although it seemed many times that long garrett was taken out for questioning then kendrick and later i got the nod i saw elinor drake a small lonely figure in the big hall moving slowly up the wide stairs doran and the police stenographer who waited for me in the stately dining room with its heavy crystal chandelier looked out of place but the lieutenant didnt feel ill at ease his questions were as coldly efficient as a surgeons knife i tried to insert a query of my own now and then but soon gave that up doran ignored all such attempts as completely as if they didnt exist then just as he dismissed me the phone rang doran answered listened scowled and then held the receiver out to me for you he said i heard merlinis voice my esp isnt working so well today ross drake is dead i get that much but just what happened up there anyway esp my eye i told him if you were a mind reader youd have been up here long ago its a sealed roomin spades the sealed room to end all sealed rooms i saw doran start forward as if to object merlini i said quickly is inspector gavigan still with you i lifted the receiver from my ear and let doran hear the yes that came back merlinis voice went on did you say sealed room the flash from headquarters didnt mention that they said an arrest had already been made it sounded like a routine case headquarters i replied has no imagination or else doran has been keeping things from them it isnt even a routine sealed room listen a woman comes to drakes house on the coldest january day since dressed only in a bathing suit she goes with him into his study they seal the window and door on the inside with gummed paper tape then she stabs him with a paper knife before he dies he knocks her out then manages to get to the phone and send out an sos shes obviously crazy she has to be to commit murder under those circumstances but drake wasnt crazy a bit eccentric maybe but not nuts so why would he lock himself in so carefully with a homicidal maniac if headquarters thinks thats routine ill then i interrupted myself there was too much silence on the other end of the wire merlini are you still there yes his voice said slowly im still here headquarters was much too brief they didnt tell us her name but i know it now then abruptly i felt as if i had stepped off into some fourthdimensional hole in space and had dropped on to some other nightmare planet merlinis voice completely serious was saying ross did the police find a silver denarius from the time of the caesars in that room or a freshly picked rose a string of buddhist prayer beads perhaps a bit of damp seaweed i didnt say anything i couldnt after a moment merlini added sothey did what was it shells i said dazedly still quite unconvinced that any conversation could sound like this philippine tree snail shells why in the name of merlini cut in hastily tell doran that gavigan and i will be there in ten minutes sit tight and keep your eyes open merlini i objected frantically if you hang up without the shells explain the bathing suit ross and make it clear why the room was sealed but they also introduce an element that gavigan and doran and the d a and the commissioner are not going to like at all i dont like it myself its even more frightening as a murder method than pk he hesitated a moment then let me have both barrels those shells suggest that drakes death might have been caused by even stranger forcesevil and evanescent onesfrom another world my acquaintance with a police inspector cut no ice with doran he ordered me right back into the living room i heard a siren announce the arrival of gavigans car shortly after but it was a long hour later before doran came in and said the inspector wants to see all of youin the study as i moved with the others out into the hall i saw merlini waiting for me its about time i growled at him another ten minutes and youd have found me doa toofrom suspense sorry you had to cool your heels he said but gavigan is being difficult as predicted he doesnt like the earful doran has been giving him neither do i the dryly ironic good humour that was almost always in his voice was absent he was unusually sober dont build it up i said ive had all the mystery i can stand just give me answers first why did you tell me to warn drake about rosa rhys i didnt expect murder if thats what youre thinking he replied drake was elaborating on some of rhines original experiments aimed at discovering whether esp operates more efficiently when the subject is in a trance state rosa is a medium oh so thats it she and drake were holding a séance merlini nodded yes the psychical research society is extremely interested in esp and pk its given them a new lease on life and i knew they had recommended rosa whom they had previously investigated to drake and what about the roman coins roses buddhist prayer beadsand snail shells why the bathing suit and how does that explain why the room was sealed but doran holding the study door open interrupted before he could reply hurry it up he ordered going into that room now was like walking on to a brightly lighted stage a powerful electric bulb of almost floodlight brilliance had been inserted in the ceiling fixture and its harsh white glare made the room more barren and celllike than ever even inspector gavigan seemed to have taken on a menacing air perhaps it was the black mask of shadow that his hat brim threw down across the upper part of his face or it may have been the carefully intent way he watched us as we came in doran did the introductions miss drake miss potter paul kendrick dr walter garrett i looked at the middleaged woman whose gayly frilled altogether feminine hat contrasted oddly with her angular figure her prim determined mouth and the chilly glance of complete disapproval with which she regarded gavigan how i whispered to merlini did isabelle potter the secretary of the psychical research society get here she came with rosa he answered the police found her upstairs reading a copy of tyrrells study of apparitionsmerlini smiled faintly she and doran dont get along they wouldnt i said they talk different languages when i interviewed her i got a travelogue on the other worldcomplete with lantern slides inspector gavigan wasted no time miss drake he began i understand the medical foundation for cancer research your father thought of endowing was originally your idea the girl glanced once at the stains on the carpet then kept her dark eyes steadily on gavigan yes she said slowly it was are you interested in psychical research elinor frowned no did you object when your father began holding stances with miss rhys she shook her head that would only have made him more determined gavigan turned to kendrick did you me paul lifted his brows i didnt know him well enough for that dont think he liked me much anyway but why a man like drake would waste his time and you doctor did i object garrett seemed surprised naturally no one but a neurotic middleaged woman would take a séance seriously miss potter resented that one dr garrett she said icily sir oliver lodge was not a neurotic woman nor sir william crookes nor professor zoellner nor but they were all senile garrett replied just as icily and as for esp no neurologist of any standing admits any such possibility they leave such things to you and your society miss potterand to the sunday supplements she gave the doctor a look that would have split an atom and gavigan seeing the danger of a chain reaction if this sort of dialogue were allowed to continue broke in quickly miss potter you introduced miss rhys to mr drake and he was conducting esp experiments with her is that correct miss potters voice was still dangerously radioactive it is and their results were most gratifying and important of course neither you nor dr garrett would understand and then garrett cut in they both led him on into an investigation of miss rhyss psychic specialtyapports he pronounced the last word with extreme distaste inspector gavigan scowled glanced at merlini and the latter promptly produced a definition an apport he said from the french apporter to bring is any physical object supernormally brought into a séance roomfrom nowhere usually or from some impossible distance miss rhys on previous occasions according to the psychical societys journal has apported such objects as roman coins roses beads and seaweed she is the greatest apport medium miss potter declared somewhat belligerently since charles bailey then shes good merlini said bailey was an apport medium whom conan doyle considered bona fide he produced birds oriental plants small animals and on one occasion a young shark eighteen inches long which he claimed his spirit guide had whisked instantly via the astral plane from the indian ocean and projected still damp and very much alive into the séance room so i said thats why this room was sealed to make absolutely certain that no one could open the door or window in the dark and help rosa by introducing of course garrett added obviously there could be no apports if adequate precautions were taken drake also moved a lot of his things out of the study and inventoried every object that remained he also suggested since i was so sceptical that i be the one to make certain that miss rhys carried nothing into the room on her person i gave her a most complete physical examinationin a bedroom upstairs then she put on one of miss drakes bathing suits did you come down to the study with her and drake gavigan asked the doctor frowned no i had objected to miss potters presence at the séance and miss rhys countered by objecting to mine she was quite right miss potter said the presence of an unbeliever like yourself would prevent even the strongest psychic forces from making themselves manifest i have no doubt of that garrett replied stiffly its the usual excuse as i told drake he tried to get her to let me attend but she refused flatly so i went back to my office down the street drakes phone call came a half hour or so later and yetgavigan eyed the two brightly coloured shells on the table in spite of all your precautions she produced two of these garrett nodded yes i know but the answer is fairly obvious now she hid them somewhere in the hall outside on her arrival and then secretly picked them up again on her way in here elinor frowned im afraid not doctor father thought of that and asked me to go down with them to the study he held one of her hands and i held the other gavigan scowled miss potter beamed did you go in with them merlini asked she shook her head no only as far as the door they went in and i heard it lock behind them i stood there for a moment or two and heard father begin pasting the tape on the door then i went back to my room to dress i was expecting paul inspector gavigan turned to miss potter you remained upstairs yes she replied in a tone that dared him to deny it i did gavigan looked at elinor paul said a moment ago that your father didnt like him why not paul exaggerates the girl said quickly father didnt dislike him he was justwell a bit difficult where my men friends were concerned he thought they were all after his money kendrick added but at the rate he was endowing medical foundations and psychic societies miss potter objected mr drake did not endow the psychical society but he was seriously considering it garrett said miss rhysand miss potterwere selling him on the theory that illness is only a mental state due to a psychic imbalance whatever that is they wont sell me on that elinor said and then turned suddenly on miss potter her voice trembling if it werent for you and your idiotic foolishness father wouldnt have beenkilled then to gavigan weve told all this before to the lieutenant is it quite necessary the inspector glanced at merlini then said i think that will be all for now okay doran take them back but none of them are to leave yet when they had gone he turned to merlini well i asked the questions you wanted me to but i still think it was a waste of time rosa rhys killed drake anything else is impossible what about kendricks cabdriver merlini asked have your men located him yet gavigans scowl practically standard operating procedure by now grew darker yes kendricks definitely out he entered the cab on the other side of town at just about the time drake was sealing this room and he was apparently still in it crossing central park at the time drake was killed so i commented hes the only one with an alibi gavigan lifted his eyebrows the only one except for rosa rhys they all have alibis the sealed room takes care of that yes merlini said quietly but the people with alibis also have motives while the one person who could have killed drake has none she did it the inspector answered so shes got a motive and well find it i wish i were as confident of that as you are merlini said under the circumstances youll be able to get a conviction without showing motive but if you dont find one it will always bother you maybe gavigan admitted but that wont be as bad as trying to believe what she says happened in this room that was news to me youve talked to rosa i asked one of the boys did gavigan said sourly at the hospital shes already preparing an insanity defence but why merlini asked is she still hysterical with fright could it be that shes scared because she really believes her storybecause something like that really did happen in here look i said impatiently is it top secret or will somebody tell me what she says happened gavigan glowered at merlini are you going to stand there and tell me that you think rosa rhys actually believes it was my question that merlini answered he walked to the table in the centre of the room she says that after drake sealed the window and door the lights were turned off and she and drake sat opposite each other at this table his back was toward the desk hers toward that screen in the corner drake held her hands they waited finally she felt the psychic forces gathering around herand then out of nowhere the two shells dropped onto the table one after the other drake got up turned on the desk light and came back to the table a moment later it happened the magician paused for a moment regarding the bare empty room with a frown drake he continued was examining the shells quite excited and pleased about their appearance when suddenly rosa says she heard a movement behind her she saw drake look up and then stare incredulously over her shoulder merlini spread his hands and thats all she remembers something hit her when she came to she found herself staring at the blood on the floor and at drakes body gavigan was apparently remembering merlinis demonstration with the gun in his office if you he warned acidly so much as try to hint that one of the people outside this room projected some mental force that knocked rosa out and then caused the knife to stab drake you know merlini said i half expected miss potter would suggest that but her theory is even more disturbing he looked at me she says that the benign spirits which rosa usually evoked were overcome by some malign and evil entity whose astral substance materialised momentarily killed drake then returned to the other world from which it came shes a mental case too gavigan said disgustedly they have to be crazy if they expect anyone to believe any such that merlini said quietly may be another reason rosa is scared to death perhaps she believes it but knows you wont in her shoes id be scared too he frowned the difficulty is the knife gavigan blinked the knife whats difficult about that if i killed drake merlini replied and wanted appearances to suggest that psychic forces were responsible you wouldnt have found a weapon in this room that made it look as if i were guilty i would have done a little deapporting and made it disappear as it is now even if the knife was propelled supernaturally rosa takes the rap and how gavigan demanded would you make the knife disappear if you were dressed as she was in practically nothing then with sudden suspicion he added are you suggesting that theres a way she could have done thatand that you think shes not guilty because she didnt merlini lifted one of the shells from the table and placed it in the centre of his left palm his right hand covered it for a brief moment then moved away the shell was no longer there it had vanished as silently and as easily as a ghost merlini turned both hands palms outward both were unmistakably empty yes he said she could have made the knife disappear if she had wanted to the same way she produced the two shells he made a reaching gesture with his right hand and the missing shell reappeared suddenly at his fingertips gavigan looked annoyed and relieved at the same time so he said you do know how she got those shells in here i want to hear it right now but gavigan had to wait at that moment a torpedo hit the watertight circumstantial case against rosa rhys and detonated with a roar doran who had answered the phone a moment before was swearing profusely he was staring at the receiver he held as though it were a live cobra he had picked up by mistake itits doc hess he said in a dazed tone he just started the autopsy and thought wed like to know that the point of the murder knife struck a rib and broke off he just dug out a triangular pointed piece ofsteel for several seconds after that there wasnt a sound then merlini spoke gentlemen of the jury exhibit a the paper knife with which my esteemed opponent the district attorney claims rosa rhys stabbed andrew drake is a copper alloyand its point as you can see is quite intact the defence rests doran swore again drakes inventory lists that letter opener but thats all there is no other knife in this room im positive of that gavigan jabbed a thick forefinger at me ross dr garrett was in here before the police arrived and miss drake and kendrick i shook my head sorry there was no knife near the door and neither elinor nor paul came more than a foot into the room dr garrett examined drake and rosa but i was watching him and ill testify that unless hes as expert at sleight of hand as merlini he didnt pick up a thing doran was not convinced look buddy unless doc hess has gone crazy too there was a knife and its not here now so somebody took it out he turned to the detective who stood at the door tom he said have the boys frisk all those people get a policewoman for miss drake and potter and search the bedroom where theyve been waiting the living room too then i had a brainstorm you know i said if elinor is covering up for someoneif three people came in here for the séance instead of two as she saysthe third could have killed drake and then gone out with the knife and the paper tape could have been i stopped pasted on the door after the murderer left merlini finished by rosa that would mean she framed herself besides gavigan growled the boys fumed all those paper strips there are fingerprints all over them all drakes merlini said doran i suggest that you phone the hospital and have rosa searched too the lieutenant blinked but she was practically naked how in blazes could she carry a knife out of here unnoticed gavigan faced merlini scowling what did you mean when you said a moment ago that she could have got rid of the knife the same way she produced those shells if it was a clasp knife merlini explained she could have used the same method other apport mediums have employed to conceal small objects under test conditions but dammit doran exploded the only place garrett didnt look was in her stomach merlini grinned i know that was his error rosa is a regurgitating medium like helen duncan in whose stomach the english investigator harry price found a hidden ghosta balledup length of cheesecloth fastened with a safety pin which showed up when he xrayed her xrays of rosa seem indicated too and search her hospital room and the ambulance that took her over okay doran gavigan ordered do it i saw an objection now youve got rosa framing herself too i said if she swallowed the murder knife why should she put blood on the letter opener that makes no sense at all none of this does gavigan complained i know merlini answered one knife was bad two are much worse and although xrays of rosa before the séance would have shown shells i predict they wont show a knife if they do then rosa needs a psychiatric examination as well dont worry gavigan said gloomily shell get one her attorney will see to that and theyll prove shes crazier than a bedbug without half trying but if that knife isnt in her his voice died then youll never convict her merlini finished if that happens the inspector said ominously youre going to have to explain where that knife came from how it really disappeared and where it is now merlinis view was even gloomier itll be much worse than that well also have an appearing and vanishing murderer to explain someone who entered a sealed room killed drake put blood on the paper knife to incriminate rosa then vanished just as neatly as any of miss potters ghostsinto thin air and merlinis prediction came true the xray plates didnt show the slightest trace of a knife and it wasnt in rosas hospital room or in the ambulance nor on garrett paul elinor drake isabelle potter nor as doran discovered on myself the drake house was a mess by the time the boys got through taking it apartbut no knife with a broken point was found anywhere and it was shown beyond doubt that there were no trapdoors or sliding panels in the study the door and window were the only exits inspector gavigan glowered every time the phone rang the commissioner had already phoned twice and without mincing words expressed his dissatisfaction with the way things were going and merlini stretched out in drakes chair his heels up on the desk top his eyes closed seemed to have gone into a trance blast it gavigan said rosa rhys got that knife out of here somehow she had to merlini are you going to admit that she knows a trick or two you dont the magician didnt answer for a moment then he opened one eye no he said slowly not just yet he took his feet off the desk and sat up straight you know he said if we dont accept the theory of the murderer from beyond then ross must be right after all elinor drakes statement to the contrary there must have been a third person in this room when that séance began okay gavigan said well forget miss drakes testimony for the moment at least that gets him into the room then what i dont know merlini said he took the roll of gummed paper tape from the desk tore off a twofoot length crossed the room and pasted it across the door and jamb sealing us in suppose im the killer he said i knock rosa out first then stab drake he paused gavigan was not enthusiastic you put the murder knife in your pocket not noticing that the point is broken you put blood on the paper knife to incriminate rosa and then he waited well go on then merlini said i get out of here he scowled at the sealed door and at the window ive escaped from handcuffs strait jackets milk cans filled with water packing cases that have been nailed shut i know the methods houdini used to break out of safes and jail cells but i feel like he did when a shrewd old turnkey shut him in a cell in scotland one time and the locka type hed overcome many times beforefailed to budge no matter how he tried or what he did the bolt wouldnt move he was sweating blood because he knew that if he failed his laboriously builtup reputation as the escape king would be blown to bits and then merlini blinked and then this time he came to a full stop staring at the door suddenly he blinked shades of hermann kellar thurston and houdini so thats it grinning broadly he turned to gavigan we will now pass a miracle and chase all the ghosts back into their tombs if youll get those people in here you know how the vanishing man vanished i asked yes its someone who has been just as canny as that scotch jailer and i know who gavigan said its about time then he walked across the room and pulled the door open tearing the paper strip in half as he did so merlini watching him grinned again the method by which magicians let their audiences fool themselvesthe simplest and yet most effective principle of deception in the whole bookand it nearly took me in elinor drakes eyes still avoided the stains on the floor paul beside her puffed nervously on a cigarette and dr garrett looked drawn and tired but not the irrepressible potter she seemed fresh as a daisy this room she said to no one in particular will become more famous in psychic annals than the home of the fox sisters at lilydale quickly before she could elaborate on that merlini cut in miss potter doesnt believe that rosa rhys killed drake neither do i but the psychic force she says is responsible didnt emanate from another world it was conjured up out of nothing by someone who waswho had to behere in this room when drake died someone whom drake himself asked to be here he moved into the centre of the room as he spoke and faced them drake would never have convinced anyone that rosa could do what she claimed without a witness so he gave someone a keysomeone who came into this room before drake and rosa and elinor came downstairs the four people watched him without moving almost i thought without breathing that person hid behind that screen and then after rosa produced the apports knocked her out killed drake and left rosa to face the music all we have to do merlini went on is show who it was that drake selected as a witness he pointed a lean forefinger at isabelle potter if drake discovered how rosa produced the shells and realised she was a fraud you might have killed him to prevent an exposure and save face for yourself and the society and you might have then framed rosa in revenge for having deceived you but drake would never have chosen you your testimony wouldnt have convinced any of the others no drake would have picked one of the scepticssomeone he was certain could never be accused of assisting the medium he faced elinor you said that you accompanied rosa and your father to the study door and saw them go in alone we havent asked miss rhys yet but i think shell confirm it you couldnt expect to lie about that and make it stick as long as rosa could and would contradict you i saw doran move forward silently closing in and paul kendrick merlini went on is the only one of you who has an alibi that does not depend on the sealed room that leaves the most sceptical one of the threethe man whose testimony would by far carry the greatest weight it leaves you dr garrett the man who is so certain that there are no ghosts is the man who conjured one up merlini played the scene down he knew that the content of what he said was dramatic enough but garretts voice was even calmer he shook his head slowly i am afraid that i cant agree you have no reason to assume that it must be one of us and no one else but i would like to hear how you think i or anyone else could have walked out of this room leaving it sealed as it was found that merlini said is the simplest answer of all you walked out but you didnt leave the room sealed you see it was not found that way i felt as if i were suddenly floating in space but look i began merlini ignored me the vanishing murderer was a trick but magic is not as most people believe only a matter of gimmicks and trapdoors and mirrors its real secret lies deeper than a mere deception of the senses the magician uses a far more important more basic weaponthe psychological deception of the mind dont believe everything you see is excellent advice but theres a better rule dont believe everything you think are you trying to tell me i said incredulously that this room wasnt sealed at all that i just thought it was merlini kept watching garrett yes its as simple as that and there was no visual deception at all it was like pk entirely mental you saw things exactly as they were but you didnt realise that the visual appearance could be interpreted two ways let me ask you a question when you break into a room the door of which has been sealed with paper tape on the inside do you find yourself still in a sealed room no i said of course not the paper has been torn and if you break into a room that had been sealed but from which someone has already gone out tearing the sealswhat then the paper i said is still torn the appearance is exactly the samemerlini finished he let that soak in a moment then continued when you saw the taped window and then the torn paper on the door you made a false assumptionyou jumped naturally but much too quickly to a wrong conclusion we all did we assumed that it was you who had torn the paper when you broke in actually it was dr garrett who tore the paperwhen he went out garretts voice was a shade less steady now you forget that andrew drake phoned me merlini shook his head im afraid we only have your own statement for that you overturned the phone and placed drakes body near it then you walked out returned to your office where you got rid of the knifeprobably a surgical instrument which you couldnt leave behind because it might have been traced to you doran hearing this whispered a rapid order to the detective stationed at the door then merlini continued you came back immediately to ring the frontdoor bell you said drake had called you partly because it was good misdirection it made it appear that you were elsewhere when he died but equally important it gave you the excuse you needed to break in and find the body without delaybefore rosa rhys should regain consciousness and see that the room was no longer sealed i hated to do it merlini was so pleased with the neat way he was tying up all the loose ends but i had to merlini i said im afraid there is one little thing you dont know when i smashed the door open i heard the paper tape tear i have seldom seen the great merlini surprised but that did it he couldnt have looked more astonished if lightning had struck him youyou what elinor drake said i heard it too garrett added and i it stopped merlini cold for a moment but only a moment then thats more misdirection it has to be he hesitated then suddenly looked at doran lieutenant get the doctors overcoat will you garrett spoke to the inspector this is nonsense what possible reason could i have for your motive was a curious one doctor merlini said one that few murderers merlini stopped as he took the overcoat doran brought in and removed from its pocket the copy of the ama journal i had noticed there earlier he started to open it then lifted an eyebrow at something he saw on the contents listing i see he said and then read a survey of the uses of radioactive traces in cancer research by walter m garrett md so thats your special interest the magician turned to elinor drake who was to head the million foundation for cancer research miss drake the girl didnt need to reply the answer was in her eyes as she stared at garrett merlini went on you were hidden behind the screen in the corner doctor and rosa rhys in spite of all the precautions successfully produced the apports you saw the effect that had on drake knew rosa had won and that drake was thoroughly hooked and the thought of seeing all that money wasted on psychical research when it could be put to so much better use in really important medical research made you boil any medical man would hate to see that happen and most of the rest of us too but we dont all have the coldly rational scientific attitude you do and we wouldnt all have realised so quickly that there was one very simple but drastic way to prevent itmurder you are much too rational you believe that one mans life is less important than the good his death might bring and you believed that sufficiently to act upon it the knife was there all too handy in your little black case and sodrake died am i right doctor doran didnt like this as a motive hes still a killer he objected and he tried to frame rosa didnt he merlini said do you want to answer that doctor garrett hesitated then glanced at the magazine merlini still held his voice was tired you are also much too rational he turned to doran rosa rhys was a cheap fraud who capitalised on superstition the world would be a much better place without such people and what about your getting that job as the head of the medical foundation doran was still unconvinced i dont suppose that had anything to do with your reasons for killing drake the doctor made no answer and i couldnt tell if it was because doran was right or because he knew that doran would not believe him he turned to merlini instead the fact still remains that the cancer foundation has been made possible the only difference is that now two men rather than one pay with their lives a completely rational attitude merlini said does have its advantages if it allows you to contemplate your own death with so little emotion gavigan wasnt as cynical about garretts motives as doran but his police training objected he took the law into his own hands if everyone did that wed all have to go armed for selfprotection merlini why did ross think he heard paper tearing when he opened that door he did hear it merlini said then he turned to me dr garrett stood behind you and miss drake when you broke in the door didnt he i nodded yes merlini opened the medical journal and riffled through it half a dozen loose pages their serrated edges showing where they had been torn in half fluttered to the floor merlini said you would have made an excellent magician doctor your deception was not visual it was auditory that gavigan said tears it later i had one further question to ask merlini you didnt explain how houdini got out of that scottish jail nor how it helped you solve the enigma of the unsealed door merlini lifted an empty hand plucked a lighted cigarette from thin air and puffed at it grinning houdini made the same false assumption when he leaned exhaustedly against the cell door completely baffled by his failure to overcome the lock the door suddenly swung open and he fell into the corridor the old scot you see hadnt locked it at all t s stribling although some of the work of southern author thomas sigismund stribling might be called localcolour writing the mainstream novels of this pulitzer prize winner are given substance by the authors stance against racism and his talent for satire stribling was the product of clifton tennessee a small town where he lived for much of his life and later another small town florence alabama typical of welleducated southerners of his era he became a teacher and a lawyer and still found time to write in his writing he experimented with various forms from a trilogy about life in the south to adventure stories set in exotic climes such as venezuela despite his pulitzer for the store today he is best remembered for the detective stories in which he introduced the psychological sleuth dr henry poggioli striblings stories of detection focus on the workings of the human mind as explained by poggioli an ohio state university professor who specialises in psychology and criminology the professors solutions of crimes depend less on interpreting physical clues and more on understanding human behaviour stribling published the first series of poggioli stories in the pulp magazine adventure in and like sir arthur conan doyle who became so weary of sherlock holmes that he killed him off only to bring him back again stribling tired of his character and used poggiolis spectacular death as the climax of the final tale but stribling bowed to popular demand revived the character and began a second series in that took him through the early s a third and final series featured the professors activities from the end of world war ii until a daylight adventure is a good example of striblings important contribution to the detective form in it psychology is at the centre of the ratiocination with which the sleuth solves crimes striblings contribution was broader than that however he develops the mildly adversarial relationship between the sleuth and the narrator and the sardonic wit that stribling uses to illuminate rural southern society makes him an early exemplar of the detective novelist as regional writer and humorist a daylight adventure the following notes concerning mrs cordy cancy were not made at the time of her alleged murder of her husband james cancy worse than that they were not taken even at the time of her trial but seven or eight months later at the perfectly hopeless date when sheriff matheny of lanesburg tennessee was in the act of removing his prisoner from the county jail to the state penitentiary in nashville such a lapse of time naturally gave neither professor henry poggioli nor the writer opportunity to develop those clues fingerprints bullet wounds and psychological analyses which usually enliven the story of any crime our misfortune was that we motored into lanesburg only a few minutes before sheriff matheny was due to motor out of the village with his prisoner and even then we knew nothing whatever of the affair we simply had stopped for lunch at the monarch cafe in courthouse square and we had to wait a few minutes to get stools at the counter finally two men vacated their places as poggioli sat down he found a copy of an old local newspaper stuck between the papernapkin case and a ketchup bottle he unfolded it and began reading as he became absorbed almost at once in its contents i was sure he had found a murder story because that is about all the professor ever reads i myself take no interest in murders i have always personally considered them deplorable rather than entertaining the fact that i make my living writing accounts of professor poggiolis criminological investigations i consider simply as an occupational hazard and hardship the square outside of our cafe was crowded with people and filled with movement and noise in the midst of this general racket i heard the voice of some revivalist preacher booming out through a loudspeaker asking the lord to save sister cordy cancy from a sinners doom and then he added the rather unconventional phrase that sister cordy was not the right sinner but was an innocent woman or nearly so that of course was faintly puzzlingwhy a minister should broadcast such a remark about one of his penitents usually the tennessee hill preacher makes his converts out to be very bad persons indeed and strongly in need of grace which i suppose most of us really are now to hear one woman mentioned in a prayer as nearly innocent was a sharp break from the usual i suppose poggioli also caught the name subconsciously for he looked up suddenly and asked me if the name cancy had been called i told him yes and repeated what i had just heard over the megaphone the criminologist made some sort of silent calculation then said evidently mrs cancy has had her baby and the sheriff is starting with her to the penitentiary in nashville i inquired into the matter poggioli tapped his paper just been reading a stenographic account of the womans trial which took place here in lanesburg a little over seven months ago she was sentenced to life imprisonment but she was pregnant at the time so the judge ruled that she should remain here in lanesburg jail until the baby was born and then be transferred to the state penitentiary in nashville so i suppose by this noise that the baby has arrived and the mother is on her way to prison just as my companion explained this the preachers voice boomed out oh lord do something to save sister cordy sheriff mathenys fixin to start with her to nashville work a miracle oh lord and convince him she is innocent you kaint desert her lord when she put all her faith an trust in you she done a small crime as you well know but done it with a pyure heart and for yore sake so come down in yore power an stop the sheriff and save an innocent woman from an unjust sentence amen then in an aside which was still audible over the megaphone sheriff matheny give us five minutes more hes bound to send sister cordy aid in the next five minutes now i myself am a tennessean and i knew how natural it was for a hillcountry revivalist to want some special favour from the lord and to want it at once but i had never before heard one ask the rescue of a prisoner on her way to nashville i turned to poggioli and said the minister admits the woman has committed some smaller crime what was that forgery he replied she forged her husbands will in favour of herself then applied the proceeds to build a new roof on the leatherwood church thats part of the court record and whats the other crimethe one she claims to be innocent of the murder of her husband jim cancy she not only claims to be innocent she really is the testimony in the trial proved that beyond a doubt i was shocked then why did the judge condemn the criminologist drew down his lips because the proof of her innocence is psychological naturally that lay beyond the comprehension of the jury and the judge too as far as that goes i stared at my companion can you prove her innocence now at this late date certainly if this paper has printed the court reporters notes correctly and im sure it has why this is the most amazing thing i ever heard ofhitting in like this what do you mean hitting in like this good heavens dont you see just as the sheriff is starting off with an innocent woman just as the preacher is asking the lord to send down some power to save her here you come along at exactly the right moment you know she is innocent and can prove it poggioli gave the dry smile of a scientific man oh i see you think my coming here is providential certainly what else is there to think i regret to disillusion you but it is not it couldnt be it is nothing more than an extraordinary coincidenceand i can prove that too with this my friend returned to his paper this left me frankly in a nervous state it seemed to me we ought to do something for the woman outside i looked at the man sitting next to us at the counter he nodded his head sidewise at poggioli he dont live around here does he i said he didnt if he dont live here how does he know whats happened in these parts you heard him say he read it in the paper he didnt do no such thing i watched him he didnt read that paper a tall he jest turned through it like i would a picture book i told him that was poggiolis way of reading it is called sightreadingjust a look and he knew it the hill man shook his head naw mister i know bettern that ive watched hunderds of men read that paper sence its laid thar on the counter and the fassest one tuk a hour an twelve minutes to git through i nodded i was not interested so i said i daresay thats true of course hits so he drawled truculently everthing i say is so im not doubting your word i placated it is you who are doubting mine you see i know my friends ability at sightreading this silenced him for a few moments then he said shrewdly looky here if he gits what he knows outn that paper how come him to say cordy cancy is innocent when the paper says shes guilty because the judgment in the paper doesnt agree with the evidence it presents my friend has gone over the evidence and has judged for himself that the woman is guilty of forgery but innocent of murder this gave the hill man pause a certain expression came into his leathery face hes a detectif aint he well not exactly he used to be a teacher in the ohio state university and he taught detectives how to detect mmmm who hard hired him to come hyar nobody i said he just dropped in by chance chanst huh you expeck me to bleve that yes i must say i do well jest look at it from my stanpointhim comin hyar the very minnit the preacher is prayin fer hep and the shurrf startin with her to the penitentiarya great detectif like him jest drap in by chanst do you expeck me to bleve that all this was delivered with the greatest heat and my seatmate seemed to hold me personally responsible for the situation well what do you believe i asked in an amiable tone which gave him permission to believe anything he wanted to and no hard feelings why jess what i said i bleve he wuz hard his suspicion of poggioli who would never accept a penny for his criminological researches amused me well thats your privilege but if it would strengthen your faith in me i will say that to the best of my knowledge and belief professor henry poggiolis arrival in lanesburg tennessee on the eve of mrs cordy cancys committal to the nashville penitentiary was a coincidence a whole coincidence and nothing but a coincidence so help me john doe i had hoped to lighten my companions dour mood but he arose gloomily from his stool i hope the lord forgives you fer mawkin his holy words they are not the lords holy words i reminded him theyre the sheriffs words when he swears in a witness anyway you tuk his name in vain when you said em didnt mention his name sir i said john doe anyway brother he continued in his menacing drawl you shore spoke with lightness the bible warns you against speakin with lightnessyou kaint git aroun that with this he took himself out of the cafe scraping his feet in the doorway as a symbol of shaking my dust from his shoes as i watched the saturnine fellow go poggioli turned from his paper poses quite a riddle doesnt he not for me i said i was born here in the hills you understand him i think so you didnt observe any more precise and concrete contradiction about him i tried to think of some simple contradiction in the man something plain i knew when poggioli pointed it out it would be very obvious but nothing came to my mind tasked him what he saw two quite contradictory reactions he was disturbed about my being a detective and about your near profanity i am afraid i dont quite see what you mean ill make it simpler he evidently was a deacon in some church why do you say that because he reproved the lightness of your language the scriptures instruct deacons to reprove the faults of the brethren and lightness of language is one of them so he was probably a deacon all right say he was what does that contradict his disturbance over my being a detective deacons are supposed to ally themselves with law and order i laughed you dont know your tennessee hill deacons that contradiction in them is historical their ancestors came here before the revolution to worship god as they pleased and escape the excise tax they have been for the lord and against the law ever since at this point another man hurried from the square into the monarch cafe i noted the hurry because under ordinary circumstances hill men never hurry not even in the rain he glanced up and down the counter immediately came to my companion and lifted a hand excuse me brother but youre not a preacher no im not said my companion then you are the detective that was sent will you come with me just what do you mean by sent asked the criminologist why the lord sent you explained the man hurriedly but earnestly brother johnson was jest prayin to the lord to send somebody to prove sister cordy cancy innocent and keep her from going to the pen jim phipps heard youall talkin an hurried out an told us there was a detectif in here so hes bound to have sent ye poggioli reflected i am sure i can prove the woman innocentfrom the evidence printed in this paper but what good will that do when the trial is over and the woman already sentenced brother said the countryman if the lord started this work dont you reckon he can go on an finish it look here poggioli i put in were here for some reason or other yes by pure chance by accident snapped the psychologist our presence has no more relation to this woman than he was looking for a simile when i interrupted if you know she is innocent dont you think it your duty to the psychologist stopped me with his hand and his expression i believe i do owe a duty yes yes i owe a duty ill go do what i can the man who came for him was most grateful so were all the people in the cafe for they had overheard the conversation everybody was delighted except me i didnt like poggiolis tone or the expression on his face i wondered what he really was going to do well by the time we got out of the restaurant everybody in the square seemed to know who we were there was a great commotion the preachers prayer for help had been answered instantly it was a miracle the soundtruck which had been booming stood in front of the county jail on the south side of the square beside the truck was the sheriffs car with the woman prisoner handcuffed in the back seat near the car stood another woman holding a young baby in her arms this infant i gathered was the prisoners child and would be left behind in the lanesburg jail while its mother went on to the penitentiary in nashville the crowd naturally was in sympathy with the woman and expected us immediately to deliver her from her troubles i heard one of the men say as we pushed forward that heavy mans the detective and that slim uns his stooge he writes down what the big un does frankly i was moved by the situation and i was most uneasy about the outcome i asked poggioli just what he meant to do he glanced at me as we walked cure them of an illusion just what do you meancure them of an he nodded at the crowd around us i will prove to these people the woman is innocent but at the same time show that my proof can be of no benefit to the prisoner this ought to convince the crowd that providence had nothing to do with the matter and it ought to make them as a group a little more rationalistic and matteroffact that is what i consider it my duty to do his whole plan appeared cruel to me i said well thank goodness you wont be able to do that in five minutes and the sheriff gave them only that much more time before he starts out my hope to avoid poggiolis demonstration was quashed almost at once i saw the sheriff a little man climb out of his car walk across to the soundtruck and take the microphone from the minister then i heard the sheriffs voice boom out ladies and gentlemen i understand there really is help on the way for mrs cancy whether it is miraculous help or jest human help i dont know but anyway im extendin mrs cancys time to prove her innocence one more hour before we start to nashville a roar of approval arose at this the minister in the truck then took over the loudspeaker brothers and sisters he began in his more solemn drawl they aint one ounce of doubt in my soul as to who sent this good man ill introduce him to you he is dr henry poggioli the great detective some of you have read about in the magazines the lord has miraculously sent dr poggioli to clear sister cordy cancy from her troubles and now ill introduce sister cordy to dr poggioli doctor sister cordy dont claim complete innocence but shes a mighty good woman she did however forge her husbans will by takin a carbon paper and some of his old love letters and tracin out a will letter by letter she sees now that was wrong but she was workin for the glory of the lord when she done it shouts of approval hereglory be save her lord and so forth the divine continued jim cancy her husban was a mawker and a scoffer he wouldnt contribute a cent to the lords cause nor bend his knee in prayer so sister cordy forged his will for religious ends now i guess the lord knew jim was goin to git killed but sister cordy didnt have a thing in the world to do with that he jest got killed and you all know what she done with his moneyput a new roof on the leatherwood churchhouse save her oh lord from the penitentiary another uproar of hope and sympathy here and brothers and sisters look how she acted in the trial when suspicion fell on her for jims murder she didnt spend one cent o that money for a lawyer she said it wasnt hers to spend it was the lords and he would save her she said she didnt need no lawyer on earth when she had one in heaven she said he would send her aid and now praise his name he has sent it here at this eleventh hour again he was interrupted by shouts and applause when a semisilence was restored he said dr poggioli you can now prove sister cordy innocent of her husbands murder and set her free in the renewed uproar the minister solemnly handed the microphone down to poggioli on the ground i have seldom been more nervous about any event in poggiolis eventful career i didnt suppose he would be in any actual danger from the irate hill people when they found out what he was trying to do but on the other hand a mob can be formed in the south in about three minutes and they are likely to do anythingride a man out of town on a rail tar and feather him give him a switching depending on how annoyed they are poggioli never lived in the south he had no idea what he was tampering with he began ladies and gentlemen i have little to say i have just read the report of mrs cancys trial in your county paper from it i have drawn absolute proof of her innocence of her husbands murder but unfortunately that proof can be of no benefit to her cries of why wont it whats the matter with it what makes you talk like that because my friends of a legal technicality if i could produce new evidence the trial judge could reopen her case and acquit mrs cancy but a reinterpretation of old evidence is not a legal ground for a rehearing all i can do now is to demonstrate to you from the evidence printed in your county paper that mrs cancy is innocent of murder but still she must go on with the sheriff to the penitentiary in nashville despair filled the square there arose outcries pleas oaths the revivalist quashed this he caught up his microphone and thundered oh ye of little faith dont you see sister cordys salvation is at hand do you think the lord would send a detectif here when it wouldnt do no good im as shore of victory as im standin here brother poggioli go on talkin with a good heart the irony of the situation stabbed me for poggioli to intend a purely materialistic solution to the situation and the minister who had besought his aid to hope for a miracle it really was ironic fortunately no one knew of this inner conflict except me or there would have been a swift outbreak of public indignation the scientist began his proof ladies and gentlemen your minister has recalled to your memory how mrs cordy cancy forged her husbands will by tracing each letter of it with a carbon paper from a package of her husbands old love letters but he did not mention the fact that after she did thisafter she had underscored and overscored these letters and made them the plainest and most conclusive proof of her forgeryshe still kept those love letters she did not destroy them she put them in a trunk whose key was lost and kept them in the family living room now every man woman and i might almost say child sees clearly what this proves of course in this he was wrong he overestimated the intelligence of his audience those nearer to him who could make themselves heard yelled for him to go on and explain further explanation is unnecessary assured the psychologist if she felt sufficiently sentimental about her husband to preserve his love letters obviously she did not mean to murder him moreover she must have realised her markedover letters would constitute absolute proof of the minor crime of forgery she must have known that if her husband were murdered her home would be searched and the telltale letters would be found therefore she not only did not murder her husband herself but she had no suspicion that he would be murdered those letters in her unlocked trunk make it impossible that she should be either the principal or an accessory to his assassination a breath of astonishment went over the crowd at the simplicity of poggiolis deduction everyone felt that he should have thought of that for himself poggioli made a motion for quiet and indicated that his proof was not concluded quiet returned and the psychologist continued your minister tells us and i also read it in the evidence printed in your county paper that mrs cancy did not hire an attorney to defend her in her trial she used the entire money to place a new roof on the old leatherwood church and she told the court the reason she did this was because god would defend her here shouts arose he did hes doin it now hes sent you here to save her poggioli held up a hand and shook his head grimly this was the point of his whole appearance in the squarethe materialistic point by which he hoped to rid these hill people of too great a reliance on providential happenings and place them on the more scientific basis of selfhelp he intoned slowly i regret to say ladies and gentlemen that my appearance here is pure accident why because i have come too late if a supernal power had sent me here to save an innocent womanand she is an innocent womanif a supernal power had sent me it would certainly have sent me in time but i am not in time the trial is over all the proof is in we cannot possibly ask a new trial on the ground of a reinterpretation of old proof which is what i am giving you that is no ground for a new trial so this innocent woman who is on her way to the penitentiary must go on and serve out her unjust term my appearance here today therefore can be of no service to anyone and can be attributed to nothing but pure chance at this pitiful negation an uproar arose in the square men surged toward the sheriff yelling for him to turn the woman free or they would do it for him cooler heads held back the insurgents and voices shouted out dr poggioli who did do the murder you know everthingwho done it the criminologist wagged a negative hand i have no idea the devil cried a thickset fellow go ahead an reason out who killed jim cancyjest like you reasoned out his wife was innocent i cant do that its impossible i havent studied the evidence of the murder merely the evidence that proves nonmurdera completely different thing go ahead go ahead yelled half a dozen voices the lord has heped you so furhell stan by you it was amusing in a grim fashion for the crowd to twist the very materialistic point poggioli was making into a logical basis for a spiritualistic interpretation however i do not think poggioli was amused he held up his hands friends how could i know anything about this when i stopped over for lunch in this village only one hour ago a driedup old farmer whose face had about the colour and texture of one of his own corn shucks called out somebody shot jim didnt they dr poggioli oh yes somebody shot him well have you got any idyah of the kind of man who shot jim cancy oh certainly i have a fairly clear idea of the kind of man who murdered cancy i allowed you had brother i allowed you had nodded the old fellow with satisfaction the lord put it into my heart to ast you exactly that question the old fellow turned to the officer shurrf matheny has he got time to tell what kind of a fellow murdered jim before you start with sister cordy to the pen the officer held up his hand i am extendin sister cordys startin time two more hoursso we can find out who murdered her husban instead of her o k called a womans voice go ahead and tell us the kind of skunk that done that well madam i would say it was a man who shot jim cancy oh yes we all know that shouted several listeners women dont shoot nobody they pisen em as a rule go on tell us sompm else well let me see pondered poggioli aloud let us begin back with the forgery itself mrs cancy did this she admits it but she did not originate the idea because that is a highly criminal idea and she does not have a highly criminal psychology she has in fact a very religious and dutiful psychology i also know that if she had been bright enough to think of tracing the will from her old love letters she would have realised how dangerous they were to keep in her unlocked trunk and would have destroyed them immediately therefore i know somebody suggested to her how she could forge the will more angry shouts interrupted here as if the crowd were reaching for the real criminal some voices tried to hush the others so the psychologist could proceed eventually poggioli went on all right mrs cancy did not originate the idea of forgery then she was used as a tool but she is not a hard resolute woman just look at her there in the sheriffs car and you can see that she is a soft yielding woman and would not carry any plan through to its bitter end but in her trial she did carry a plan through to its bitter end and this end odd to say was to put a new roof on the leatherwood church ladies and gentlemen a new roof on leatherwood church was the basic motive for cancys murder it is fantastic but it is the truth mrs cancy refused to hire a lawyer when she came to trial why to save the money to put a roof on leatherwood church so the person who persuaded her to commit the forgery must also have persuaded her to withhold the money for the church roof and that god would come down and set her free from the charge of murder at this the enthusiasm of the crowd knew no bounds they flung up their hats they yelled they cried out that now the lord had come to help sister cordy just like he had promised the sheriff arose in his car and shouted that he extended sister cordys leaving time for the rest of the day he yelled that they were hot on the trail of the man who done it and he would remain in town to make the arrest i could see poggioli was unnerved it would take a cleverer psychologist than i am to explain why he should be of course his demonstration was going awry he was not getting where he had intended to go he lifted up his hands and begged the crowd my friends please remember this i do not know the man i have no idea who he is i can only give you his type all right shouted many voices go on and give us his type so sheriff matheny can arrest him the criminologist collected himself as to his type i ate lunch in the monarch cafe a little while ago and was reading an account of mrs cancys trial in your county paper as i read a gentleman beside me said that he had been watching strangers read the story of that trial for months as it lay there on the lunch counter it is possible such a man might have some connection with the murder or he may have been morbidly curious about crime in general shouts of satisfaction herego ahead now youre gittin somewhere poggioli stopped them wait wait i by no means incriminate this gentleman i am trying to show you the various hypotheses which a criminologist must apply to every clue or piece of evidence all right doctor if he didnt kill jim cancy who did poggioli mopped his face that i do not know nor do i know anything whatever about the man in the cafe i am simply trying to give you a possible psychological description of the murderer now this man at my table also reprimanded my friend here for what he considered to be an infraction of a religious formality in fact he became quite angry about it that would link up with the fact that jim cancy was reported to be a freethinker a freethinker would have irritated such a man very deeply if cancy had jibed at this mans faith the fellow would have felt that any punishment he could inflict on the mocker would be justified even unto death also he could have persuaded himself that any money he might receive from cancys death should be devoted to the welfare of the churchas for example to put a new roof on the leatherwood church following these plans he could have easily influenced mrs cancy to forge cancys will with the understanding that the money would go to the church then he could have waylaid and shot cancy and made the will collectible this would have accomplished two things gratify his private revenge and make a contribution to the church the murderer could be of that type or he could be of a completely different type which i shall now try to analyze how many more types poggioli would have described nobody knew for at this juncture the sheriff discovered that his prisoner had fainted this created a tremendous commotion for a hill woman to faint was almost as unparalleled as for a horse to faint sheriff matheny arose in his car and hallooed that he would carry no sick woman to the nashville pen and that mrs cancy should remain here with her baby until she was completely recovered even if it took a week after making this announcement the officer climbed out of his car and disappeared in the throng everybody was gratified they came pouring around poggioli to congratulate him on his speech a fat man elbowed up seized poggioli by the arm motioned at me too and shouted at us to come to dinner in his hotel poggioli said we had just eaten at the monarch caf then youall are bound to be hungry come on my wife sent me over here to bring ye she feeds all the revivalists and their singers who come to preach in the square the criminologist repeated that we were not hungry but the fat man came close to him and said in what was meant for an undertone dont make no diffrunce whether you are hungry or notmy wife wants you to come inside while you and your buddy are alive alive said my friend shore alive do you think deacon sam hawley will let any man stand up in the public square and accuse him of waylayin jim cancy and then not kill the man who does the accusin my friend was shocked why i never heard of deacon sam hawley hes the man you et by and he knows you come on both of you but i was simply describing a type brother when you go to a city you find men in typesall dentists look alike all bankers look alike all lawyers look alike and so on but out here in these tennessee hills we aint got but one man to a type and when you describe a mans type youve described the man come on in to my hotel before you git shot were trying to make lanesburg a summer resort and we dont want it to git a bad name for murderin tourists we could see how a hotel owner would feel that way and we too were anxious to help preserve lanesburgs reputation for peace and friendliness we followed our host rather nervously to his hotel across the square and sat down to another lunch there was a big crowd in the hotel and they were all talking about the strange way the lord had brought about the conviction of deacon sam hawley and rescued a comparatively innocent woman from an unjust sentence poggioli pointed out once or twice that the woman was not out of danger yet but all the diners around us were quite sure that she soon would be the whole incident seemed about to end on a kind of unresolved anticlimax the diners finally finished their meal and started out of the hotel we asked some of the men if they thought it would be safe for us to go to our car they said they didnt know we would have to try it and see poggioli and i waited until quite a number of men and women were going out of the hotel and joined them we were just well put on the sidewalk when a brisk gunfire broke out from behind the office of the lane county weekly herald which was just across the street from the hotel it was not entirely unexpected besides that sort of thing seemed to happen often enough in lanesburg to create a pattern for public action everybody jumped behind everybody else and holding that formation made for the nearest doors and alleys at this point sheriff matheny began his counterattack it was from a butchers shop close to the hotel how he knew what point to pick out i dont know whether or not he was using us for bait i still dont know at any rate the sheriffs fourth or fifth shot ended the battle our assailant quite naturally turned out to be deacon sam hawley he was dead when the crowd identified him in the skirmish the sheriff was shot in the arm and everybody agreed that now he would not be able to take mrs cancy to the penitentiary for a good three months to come she was reprieved at least for that long as we got into our car and drove out of lanesburg the crowd was circulating a petition to the governor to pardon mrs cordelia cancy of the minor crime of forgery the petition set forth mrs cancys charity her purity of heart her generosity in using the proceeds of her crime for the church and a number of her other neighbourly virtues the village lawyer put in a note that a wife cannot forge her husbands signature he argued that if she cannot steal from him then she cannot forge his name which is a form of theft she simply signs his name for him she does not forge it the petition was signed by two hundred and fortythree registered democratic voters the governor of tennessee is a democrat at this point we drove out of lanesburg william campbell gault b william campbell gault epitomised the professional practitioner of the detective and suspense genre through the middle years of the twentieth century gault started young winning a prize for a short story when he was sixteen and making the slim living typical of the business by the time he was nineteen he was a product of the hardworking middle class augmenting his writing income by cutting leather in a shoe factory helping his mother manage a hotel and after army service during world war ii working for douglas aircraft and the us postal service typical of the times and the trade gault was versatile and prolific in the decade and a half during which the magazine fiction market flowered he sold more than short stories to the sport sciencefiction and mystery pulps when television killed the magazine market in the early s he turned to writing novels for the paperback original and hardcover markets in three of his novels were published and one dont cry for me won an edgar award from the mystery writers of america gaults work moved forward from the hardboiled privateeye fiction of the period his books had a moral purpose they challenged racial class and ethnic stereotypes and won for him the lifetime achievement award of the private eye writers of america gaults most memorable contribution to the advancement of the genre was his development of brock callahan the series character of his later books as a fully developed personality with a biography that explains his character and his motives and gives these books a special depth his most significant achievement was his championing of the disadvantaged and his unusual for his day respect for females gault also pursued a serious career as a writer of sports fiction for the juvenile market as such he was concerned with fair play and he became adept at portraying relationships between males of all ages especially boys and teenagers in see no evil gault has a young man puzzle out the truth behind a crime while struggling to exonerate his kid brother this story is an important example of a pulp writer dealing with issues of race and setting the stage for later genre writers who would use their tales to deal with social issues see no evil at breakfast there was the story again in the papers i looked over at my brother and saw his

his foot coming for my jaw as i scrambled on the concrete and i twisted clear of it i was on my feet when he closed again i put a fine left deep into his belly and heard him grunt his head crashed my mouth and the blood spurted i caught him on the nose with a wild left and he paused for maybe a second my right caught his left eye he started one from the floor and i beat him to it it was a button

pete was crying and ma too it was wonderful anthony boucher it may be said that in detective fiction anthony boucher is an exception to the old rule them that can do them that cant teach as the most influential critic of popular literature of his time boucher taught readers of the new york times book review the new york herald tribune book review and the san francisco chronicle what it takes to make a good detective novel he also wrote seven of them himself the son of two physicians boucher was born in california as william anthony parker white he graduated phi beta kappa from the university of southern california where he spent much of his free time acting directing and writing drama after earning a master of arts degree from the university of california berkeley he began an unsuccessful career as a playwright after he failed to sell two plays he began writing detective novels using the anthony boucher pen name because he still regarded himself as a playwright as boucher he created the redhaired private eye fergus obreen and lieutenant a jackson of the los angeles police departments homicide division as series characters he used another pen name h h holmes for his two novels featuring sister ursula a devout nun and clever sleuth who aids in the cases of lapd homicide lieutenant terence marshall he also penned radio scripts and wrote and edited science fiction in terms of plotting character development and social comment bouchers mystery writing was not exceptional for the time plots tend to centre on puzzles and solutions depend on deductions drawn from plenty of wellplaced clues bouchers fiction is most notable for the wit and literary allusions that enrich his books and short stories while bouchers fiction was well received critics agree that his major contribution was his literary criticism it is impossible to overestimate the importance of bouchers serious reviewing in the new york times of a genre previously disdained as mere entertainment or trashy fiction his excellent taste and judgment as a critic were reinforced by his editing of texts and anthologies in the field he won the mystery writers of americas edgar award three times for his critical work that organisations annual convention was eventually named for him the bouchercon now attracts more than a thousand mystery fans writers editors collectors and hangerson each year its international importance is underlined by the fact that the twentysixth bouchercon in was the second to be held in england crime must have a stop features nick noble one of bouchers bestdeveloped characters noble is an alcoholic former cop who solves crimes while drinking cheap wine and making allusions to sherlock holmes shakespeare and christopher marlowe in a mexicanstyle bar in los angeles crime must have a stop the third set of flashbulbs exploded and the actress relaxed and pulled down her skirt lieutenant macdonald continued to stare somewhat foolishly at the silver trophy in his hands well the actress grinned how does it feel to be the recipient of the real detective award for the real detective of the year thirstifying said macdonald honestly the actress nodded well spoken my fine ferreting friend i always feel a spot of alcohol is indicated after cheesecake myself where are we going macdonald still contemplated the trophy it had been exciting very exciting to be chosen by the top factcrime radio program for its annual award but hed been feeling uneasy ever since the announcement despite the extraordinary record of solved cases that had made him the bright young star of the los angeles police department he felt like an impostor mind a ride downtown he asked were going to deliver this trophy to the man it really belongs to the actress raised her unplucked brows as they turned east on sunset ive worked in hollywood for three years she said and ive never known whether sunset boulevard ran beyond gower they tell me theres a city called los angeles down this way that where were going uh huh and youre going to meet the damnedest man in that city of the damned and macdonald began the story he began with his own first casethe case that started with his finding a dead priest and ended with his shooting one of his fellow lieutenants he explained where he had found the solution of that case and where he had found the solution for which he had just been awarded the trophy you werent giving awards back in the early thirties he said but there was a man in the department then who topped anybody youve honoured he had a mind its hard to describe a mind of mathematical precision with a screwball offbeat qualitya mind that could see the shape of things grasp the inherent pattern like a good director the actress put in something macdonald admitted then there came that political scandalmaybe youve heard echoesand the big shakeup there was a captain who knew what wires to pull and there was a lieutenant who took the rap the lieutenant was our boy he had a wife then and she needed an operation the pay checks stopped coming and she didnt get it the actresss lively face grew grave as she followed the relentless story of the disintegration of greatness the brilliant young detective stripped at once of career and wife slipping skidding until there was nothing left but the comfort of cheap sherry and the occasional quickening of the mind when it was confronted with a problem macdonald pulled up in front of the chula negra he peered in caught sight of mama gonzales third daughter rosario and beckoned her to the door you got any marches on your juke box he asked handing her a nickel so it was to the strains of the mexican national hymn that the real detective award trophy entered the little mexican restaurant lieutenant macdonald bore it proudly aloft and the actress followed him confused and vaguely delighted mexicanos al grito de guerra macdonald halted in front of the fourth booth on the left with the certainty of finding its sharpnosed whiteskinned inhabitant he placed the trophy on the table flourished his hand and proclaimed to the real detective of the year the actress placed one foot on the bench and lifted her skirt over her knee that makes it an official award she grinned al sonoro rugir del candn boompty boomp nick nobles pale blue eyes surveyed the symbolic silver figure of justice triumphant over wrongdoing if it was only a cup he sighed and downed his water glass of sherry that was the start of an evening memorable in many ways it was macdonalds first nonprofessional visit to the chula negra and he was amazed to realise that nick noble could drop cryptic comments on the theatre of twenty years ago which fascinated the actress as much as his comments on crime had stimulated the lieutenant he was further amazed to realise the warmth and vitality of the girl beside him whom he had at first regarded solely as the inevitable wench demanded by cameramen they fitted together somehow her bubbling eagerness and nobles weary terseness they belonged together because they were the same thing underneath the same piercing through of conventional acceptance straight to reality macdonald was growing more and more aware of the girl more and more aware of the peculiarity of a mans being single in his thirties when the episode began which was to make the evening completely memorable it started unspectacularly enough with a voice calling hi don the voice was highpitched but firmly malea tenor with baritone quality the man was slight but firmly built dressed in the standard mismatched uniform of middlebracket hollywood and macdonald was certain hed never seen him before but even as the man seized his hand as the actress looked up curiously and nick noble finished his latest sherry macdonald began thinking back far back obviously anyone who called him don dated from college days at usc now he was mac or lieutenant or loot a faint but ghastly picture flitted across his mind of something called an apolliad an evening of students creative contributions to the higher literature there must be some reason why he was thinking of thatthere must in fact have been some reason why he had attended it steve harnett he cried you old son of a he broke off glancing sideways at the actress ive heard the word she said dryly i just didnt think men ever greeted each other that way outside of bad plays and rotary club meetings its grand to see you don harnett was saying i kept reading about you in the papers and saying ive got to look you up and then well you know how it is dont i macdonald confessed i read about you too ill go you one better i even listen to pursuit just to see how far away from real murder you can get oh do you write pursuitonly half of the girls breathlessness was good technique i shouldve warned you macdonald looked rueful shes a radio actress and therefore should know by now that a writers introduction to the producer is the kiss of death still you might as well introduce us sure good lord do you realise that in all the hullabaloo of those publicity photographs i never did catch your name lynn dvorak said nick noble quietly dont tell me thats a deduction asked her while you were greeting your friend macdonald grinned if all your rabbitsoutofsherrybottles were as simple as that they are said noble to me his washedout blue eyes glazed over oddly as he contemplated the actress and the radio writer someone presumably introduced tristan to iseult and paolo to francesca no one introduced petrarch to laura so no one wrote a tragedy on the subject culminating in murder someone introduced harvey hawley crippen to ethel leneve and someone introduced judd gray to ruth snyder and lieutenant donald macdonald homicide lapd said lynn dvorak may i present steve harnett so for once macdonald was later to reflect nick noble had been in on a murder even before it happened it was in october that first and fatal interview and throughout that winter the lieutenant kept running into steve and lynn at the philharmonic at musso and franks at the biltmore theater until he began thinking of them as steveandlynn in one word and automatically looking for one if he saw the other i started something he would muse ruefully as he had a drink with them after a concert it was not only that they were physically in love even to the handholdinginpublic stage which was embarrassing in a man of steves thirtysix years but they obviously fitted together so well in so many nonphysical respects their ears heard the same music their mouths laughed the same laughter but with steve at least there was something under the laughter something that caused moments when the successful writer the man happily in love gave way for an instant to a small boy terrified of some incalculable but certain retribution it was one of those moments that seized steve as the three of them were drinking after an unusually interesting production of oneacts at the actors lab he had said nothing for five minutes and there was supplication in the glance lynn cast to macdonald as she gave up her singlehanded attempt at brightness and retired to the ladies room macdonald could think of nothing to do but emit that wordless questioning noise and assume that sympathetic halfsmile which had caused the pengcraft murderer to reveal where he had hidden the other half of the body steve harnett roused himself from his brooding ive got to talk to you don he said abruptly its getting me down i cant think straight any time said macdonald unless a crime wave takes priority dinner next thursday steve said eagerly im in brentwood its in the phone book say around seven for drinks macdonald made a note and tried to smile reassuringly at lynn when she came back that couple you introduced here nick noble asked two nights later when macdonald had dropped in with a report on the deathcell confession of a man in whose career noble had taken a certain decisive interest they all right sure i guess so liked the girl alivelike martha trouble for her sorry why should there be trouble macdonald asked uneasily nick noble paused and deliberately brushed away the fly which always perched invisibly on his sharp nose call it the unspeckled band he said there were times macdonald reflected as he beckoned to rosario when nick nobles cryptic impulses seemed to spring from pure malice the harnett home was small comfortable unpretentious and therefore probably only mildly fabulous in cost steve harnett macdonald had learned from a few questions of other friends in radio was well in the chargeaccountatthebrownderby class but somewhat short of the swimming pool level his questions should have prepared him for his first surprise but there was one question he hadnt thought to ask the woman who answered the door was in her early thirtiesslender a trifle pale and more than a trifle attractive again in a comfortable unpretentious and mildly expensive manner she held out a hand and said good evening lieutenant macdonald im harrietsteves wife abruptly macdonald understood the unspeckled bandthe colourless strip on steves third finger left hand he was still trying to mask his angry amazement with polite conversation when steve came in followed by a plain heavyset girl with a handful of papers here in brentwood domesticity macdonald observed steve wore a plain gold wedding ring glad you could make it don you and harriet getting yourselves acquainted this is pat mcveagh my secretarylieutenant macdonald and he was suddenly very busy with ice and gin and vermouth and lemon peel and the careful avoidance of macdonalds eyes the secretary left after one drink without having opened her mouth for any nonalcoholic purpose then just as macdonald was trying to get the feel of the harrietsteve relationship the elder mrs harnett slipped in and there were more introductions macdonald could not have told you an hour after dinner what he had eaten he was too concentrated on trying to persuade himself that he was on a social and not a professional visit he was too surrounded by all too tangible undercurrents mrs harriett sr he decided was the most obtrusively unobtrusive little old lady he had ever known she effaced herself completelya gray wraith in a corner coming to life only with an occasional plaintive dontmindme but whatever topic was under discussionanother round of drinks a proposed weekend at la jolla a new limerick of steves compositionher quiet reminder of her own selfeffacement had the power of a security council veto there were other undercurrents a barb from steve to harriet about the cooking of the dinner a barb from harriet to steve about his prospects in radio some obscure reference to the absent secretary it was with great relief that macdonald let steve drag him off to the study as soon as decently possible after dinner it was a good room from the outmodedly comfortable chairs to the cases full of erratically and lovingly chosen books from the battered standard typewriter to the miniature electric icebox of the type usually employed for baby formula steve harnett took two cans of beer from the box punctured them handed one to his guest kicked off his shoes and began to pace around the room necessary adjunct to work beer he muttered always figure it takes me exactly a quart to a script you work on beer and nick noble on sherry macdonald observed and i cant drink on duty theres no justice in this world he waited but steve kept on pacing you never mentioned harriet he said expressionlessly i suppose i mustve read about your marriage in an alumni bulletin but id forgotten weve been married ten years steves voice was more tenor than baritone now any children last fall we were hoping thats when i met you but in december harriet had to go to the hospital now they say we wont ever so it all started while harriet was steve stopped pacing dont think im saying that to justify it don im not i cant justify it not even to myself but its happenedhell it happened that night down at your little mex joint dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might who ever loved that loved not at first sightmacdonald finished for him i remember steve you always were a sucker for quotations lends authority doesnt it takes away your own responsibility for what youre saying does my radiotrained ear detect what we clichéexperts call a thinlyveiled edge of contempt in your voice don its no business of mine macdonald said optimistically but youre getting yourself into one sweet mess does harriet know i dont think so shes bound to eventually you havent been precisely discreet and theres always a helpful friend does lynn know about harriet yes steves eyes rested on the gold band on his left hand in other words now she does but she didnt at first steve didnt answer that one instead he said but don you dont understand maybe nobody can until it happens to him but this this isnt just an affair are they ever it isnt just fun in bed its being togetherbeing us so what did you want me for name of a good lawyer steve drew back suddenly but i couldnt divorce harriet i love her let them eat cake macdonald snorted and have it too dont you see don theyre both so so right both things the thing with me and harriet and the thing with me and lynn i cant say this i cleave to this i discard it wouldnt be fair to either of them which the present situation of course is hell don im not an adulterer steve managed an odd sort of smile im a bigamist he added hesitantly theres a quotation for that too how happy could i be with either were tother fair charmer away macdonald could not swear why he shivered at that moment but he had a rough idea i still dont see why you wanted to talk to me about it i did introduce you but i think its because i knew you pretty well a long time ago but youre not a part of my present life i had to talk to somebody i cant talk to people who know me and harriet now i had to talk it out just to see if macdonald knew very well why he was shivering as he replied you know steve i dont think that was the reason underneath and it wasnt im sure macdonald said later that night to nick noble you asked about trouble here it is and your unspeckled band can prove as venomous as a swamp adder if thats what it was and subconsciously at least steve sees it too that this is the buildup to a standard clichéexpert murder situation each woman has a motive for killing the other and if steve ever gets out of the equipoise of his beggars opera howhappycouldibewitheither hell have a motive for getting rid of the girl left over that subconscious fear of murder led him to expose the situation to a homicide officer there was a water glass full of sherry in front of nick noble he took what seemed like a casual swig and the glass was half full then he muttered beggars opera and shook his head groucho marx he said decisively even after long years of inoculation lieutenant macdonald could still occasionally be taken aback in the chula negra and how did groucho marx get into this didnt ever see animal crackersnoble murmured regretfully long time agoway back when his voice trailed away macdonald understood way back when lieutenant nicholas noble the pride of homicide took his beautiful wife martha to the pictures but what can i do macdonald insisted what can any officer do when he sees a murder building up in front of himcast and motives complete and nothing to do but wait until it happens for once nick noble had not even a cryptic answer that was in march the murder did not come until late april in the interval macdonald steered away from any contact with steve and lynn a meeting now could prove too embarrassing but he heard enough gossip to know that harriet if still ignorant must have no friends and no telephone and he heard other gossip too to the effect that steve harnett was cracking up as a radio writer that his option wouldnt be picked up at the end of this thirteen on pursuit which with the freelance market shot to pieces macdonald had tried to avoid embarrassment in seeing steve again but it was not embarrassment that he felt now in april as he faced steve harnett beside the pinkruffled bed which held harriets curiously arched body there was no emotion save cold rage in macdonalds voice as he roared so you finally made up your mind steve had his shoes off and a tumbler of straight whiskey in his hand he looked up helplessly and said you wont believe me don why should you but you dont understand macdonald controlled his voice look steve theres only one way to play this im just any cop and youre just any husband of the deceased all right we know its strychnine even a layman could tell that now tell me how steves vitality and charm had yielded to bewildered chaos as i was saying it must have been the candy i was working late and harriet took the candy to bed with her i worked so late i slept on the couch in the study this morning mother found her nobody heard anything she mustve gone through hell mothers not well she usually takes phenobarbital at night and when a scripts going hot the house could fall down and i wouldnt know it now this candy i was telling you it just came in the mail and we thought whoever forgot to put in a card would phone about it its a kind harriet likes so and you write mystery shows macdonald gasped one of the oldest clichésin fact and fictionand you let your wife i suppose theres independent evidence that the candy actually did come in the mail mother was with us when harriet opened the package she didnt want any sweets upset her and i was drinking beer so harriet took them to bed later on i think the wrappers still in the wastebasket a brandnew machine had replaced the battered standard in steves study macdonald found a label in the drawer of the desk and inserted it in the typewriter when he had finished typing he set it beside the label on the wrapper from the wastebasket there was no telling the two labels apart steves mouth opened wide but does that prove no macdonald grunted it doesnt its a new machine it hasnt had time to develop obvious idiosyncrasies any new typewriter of the same model would have approximately the same result but it does indicate the phone rang macdonald picked it up an impersonal voice announced i have a call from new york for mr stephen harnett new york for you said macdonald sponsor trouble steve groaned or the network on that last scripti was afraid it was a little too blast it i cant handle things like that now i cant try said macdonald occupy your mind while i see lynn dvorak steve had started to reach a shaky hand toward the phone now he snatched it back lynn you cant drag her into this cant i you say youre innocent ok who else has a motive go talk to your sponsor lynn there was horror in steves eyes she couldnt have go on telephone see you later steve laughed harshly life must go on and stuff and lifes crimes fool steve harnetts hand wavered halfway to the telephone as macdonald left the room he could hear angry squawks coming from the still unanswered receiver the lieutenant had never been more wretched on professional business than he was as he drove to the little house in the hills east of highland almost in downtown hollywood a baffling case was one thing that you could sink your teeth into or if it was too flatly impossible you could take it to the chula negra and watch nick nobles eyes glaze over as he probed to the truth but something so wretchedly obvious as this he had inadvertently started it all he had quite advertently foreseen its inevitable outcome and here it was he remembered steve harnett even back at the university as flashy clever plausible entertainingbut essentially weak thered been something he couldnt recall the details about a girl that mrs harnett didnt quite approve of and how shed managed to break up the relationship and thered been that odd episode when steve was directing a play the two girls both beautiful both good actresses both avid for the leadand steves sudden pneumonia followed by two weeks convalescence on the desert while someone else took over the direction and casting a psychoanalyst he reflected could have funprobably would have if there was enough money in the defence and meanwhile the layman could content himself with the oldfashioned verdict that there were certain people who simply didnt have the courage to face up to things there was of course the remote possibility that lynn might be the actual sender of the strychnineladen chocolates but how much did that direct responsibility matter compared with the ultimate responsibility of what steve had done to both women except of course that in that case lynn would go to the gas chamber and steve would probably go on writing radio melodramas there was no answer to his ring the door was unlocked so he didnt have to worry about skeleton keys he didnt have to worry about lynn and the gas chamber either she sat in a chair halffacing the door well lit by the reading lamp which must have been left burning from the night before her face grinned at him in that sardonic welcome which only a strychninefed host can provide there were smudges of chocolate on the grinning lips and there was a box of chocolates on the table by the phone macdonald used the phone to call the necessary technicians before they arrived he had discovered in the wastebasket the familiar wrapper and the familiar typed label and now macdonald demanded in the fourth booth on the left of the chula negra where the hell are we hell said nick noble succinctly and truthfully it made sense before steve had made up his mind he didnt have the heart or the guts to make a clean cut so he simply removed the one he didnt want it wouldve made the same kind of sense if wed found only lynn but both of them that switches the motivation altogether now we have to look for somebody who wants both women out of steve harnetts life and who has such a motive he paused and tried to answer himself ive got to look into the secretary every so often theres something in this officewife business shes a dowdy homely wench but she probably doesnt see herself that way labels said nick noble lets see macdonald placed them before him mrs stephen harnett verdugo drive los angeles calif mrs lynn dvorak las aves road hollywood calif nick noble leaned back in the booth and a film seemed to obscure his eyes mrs he said softly lynn divorced three years ago that doesnt enter in youll notice the postmark too downtown hollywood steve admitted hed been in to see the advertising agency but that doesnt help now the secretary lives near herewhich might be a good reason for not mailing here and that reminds me im down in this part of town to see her id better why said nick noble macdonald smilingly disregarded the query ohone odd thing i forgot to tell you about steve when that new york call came through he muttered something about life goes on and added lifes crimes fool i told you hes a sucker for quotations but i couldnt spot this one it bothered me so i stopped at the library to use a concordance its hotspurs death speech in henry iv part i the same speech huxley used for a title a while back only its properly lifes times fool interesting subconscious twist dont you think nick nobles lips moved softly almost inaudibly but thoughts the slave of life and lifes times fool and time that takes survey of all the world must have a stop he broke off looking almost embarrassed by so long and articulate a speech wife and i he explained used to read shakespeare time crime must have a stop lieutenant macdonald this was a strange new voice deep with a slight central european accent bitterly remembering what had begun when last a new voice accosted him in the chula negra macdonald looked up to see a dapper little man waving a sheet of notepaper at him they tell me at your headquarters the little man was saying i may possibly find you in this lokal so i come our friend stephen harnett gives me this letter for you long since but i am first now in los angeles with the opportunity to present it puzzled macdonald began to read dear don this is to introduce dr ferdinand wahrschein who is need i say a friend of the sponsors wife and who is conducting a technical investigation into american police methods id deeply appreciate and so would the sponsor any help which you can give him sincerely steve the lieutenant rose tossing the letter to nick noble delighted to meet you but you catch me just when i am leaving to interview a witness and id sooner do it alone but i tell you what if you really want to know how the local department cracks its toughest nuts you stay right here with the master and he was gone dr ferdinand wahrschein stared speculatively at the pinched white face in the booth then gingerly seated himself and resignedly began na also is it your finding that anthropometric method sherry suggested nick noble hospitably miss patricia mcveagh had a room adjacent bathno cooking priv in what had once been an old family mansion on bunker hill lieutenant macdonald walked from the chula negra to third and hill and there rode up the funicular angels flight he was glad he was in plain clothes the once fashionable bunker hill district is now tenanted largely by mexicans and by americans of spanishindian descent many of whom feel they have good reason not to care for uniformed members of the los angeles police department miss mcveagh opened the door and said lieutenant macdonald isnt it what on earth her tone meant a she hadnt seen todays papers or b such an actress was wasting her time as a secretary she hadnt grown any more glamorous since the martinis in march but there was something possibly preferable to glamour in the smile of hospitality which managed to conquer her puzzlement macdonald began abruptly i dont need to bother you with the complete fillin which is one of the best known ways of causing witnesses to volunteer their own suggestions its just a routine matter of checking certain movements in the harnett household i gather you werent working there today miss mcveagh smiled is that what mr harnett told you i suppose i shouldnt look lieutenant i dont have anything to drink but how about some nescafe i could talk easier with a cup in my hand do you mind macdonald did not mind he liked people to talk easy and while he waited for the nescafe he decided he liked people who lived in cheap rooms and spent the money they saved on a judicious balance of bach johann sebastian and tatum art miss mcveagh came back with two cups and a carbon copy of a letter if its just where do i stand with the harnett household this letter ought to clear things up i mailed it this morning macdonald read dear mr harnett i realise that your financial position since pursuit did not pick up the option makes my regular employment out of the question but i still feel as i told you that time when i so mistakenly took a second of your martinis that a good secretary is also a collaborator for that reason id like to offer to place my secretarial services on a speculative basis the exact terms we can work out if you like the idea but the general notion would be that id work on the usual schedule but be paid anywhere from to according to your monthly level he stopped reading there and said you love him that much love her mouth opened wide youd work for nothing just to try to pull him back on his feet i would so where does love come in it would seem macdonald observed between swallows of nescafe to indicate at least a certain devotion sure she nodded devotion to pat mcveagh look lieutenant steve harnetts good when he does write he can write like a blue streak and when he gets himself straightened out hes going to hit the big time whats radio whats five hundred a week said she blithely on bunker hill but its true its the real big time steve harnetts headed for and when he hits it i want in this not being straightened out macdonald ventured its been bad its been hell she said flatly ill tell you last week i was typing some letters on the standard out in the patio he was supposed to be roughing out a plot in the study on his portable comes time for me to go home he has to sign the letters he hasnt emerged i take a chance on his wrath and knock on the study door he doesnt shout he just whispers come in and i come in and there he is hes been in there eight hours he hasnt done one blessed word his hands are shaking and his eyes look like hes going to cry i give him the letters he picks up a pen and it falls out of his fingers thats how bad its been lieutenant but im still sold on him and ill take my chances dr ferdinand wahrschein felt a buzzing in his head he was not sure whether to attribute it to his first experience with california sherry by the water glass or to the answers he was receiving to his methodically prepared questionnaire nine out of ten of those answers would baffle him completely but the tenth would cast a lightning flash of clarification on a long obscure problem pleasantly bebuzzed he sat back and listened to lieutenant macdonalds resume of his conversation with miss mcveagh im sold on her nick macdonald ended here read her letter ill swear thats an absolutely honest expression of just what her interest in steve harnett is and if shes out on motive whos left nick noble accepted the letter and handed back another paper in exchange something for you to read too came by messenger my dear mr noble my son informs me that he has once met you and that you have had extraordinary success in solving problems perplexing to the regular police though i do not know you may i beg you to exert your abilities on the problem of the deaths of my sons wife and of his friend my son is no ordinary man and his peace of mind if you can secure it will be deeply valued by your sincere friend florence harnett mrs s t harnett see it now said nick noble macdonald felt dr wahrscheins beady and eager eyes on him and sensed vaguely that the honour of the department depended on him i cant say he began labels said nick noble look at them macdonald looked at the labels he stared at them he glared at them he scrutinised their inscrutability then suddenly he seized the other three papers which lay on the table spread them in a row before him looked from one to the other and slowly nodded you see said nick noble clear pattern three main points groucho marx macdonald nodded gravely hed remembered that one meanwhile dr ferdinand wahrschein stared at him noble went on the cliché cliché the chocolates everybody knows gimmick botkin molineux anthony berkeley why eat unless of course and the third point macdonald indicated the assorted papers before him and echoed nobles own statement crime must have a stop dr ferdinand wahrschein giggled and beckoned to rosario for more sherry this essay on american police methods should be aber fabelhaft steve harnett filled his glass of straight whiskey im alone he said thickly alone theyre gone harriets gone lynns gone too how happy but theyre gone his bare toes wiggled in anguish and pursuits gone too come thursday week and mcveaghs gone on account of i cant pay her any more im alone are you mrs harnett asked gently she sat unobtrusively in a corner while her son paced the room i know steve muttered youre here youre always here darling and you know how much blast it there is truth in clichés a mans best mother is his the phone rang ill take it dear mrs harnett seemed hardly to move but the phone had not rung three times before she answered it just a minute she said quietly into the mouthpiece ill see if hes in she put her hand over the diaphragm as she whispered new york steve let out a yell they fire me and still they own my soul while the contract runs but i cant not now i cant look at my hands theyre quivering like an aspen an aspic an aspen he was still judiciously weighing the two words when mrs harnett had finished murmuring apologies and hung up ill stand between you and these things now dear she murmured ill but the next ring was on the doorbell and lieutenant macdonald was not having any standing between he strode in snatched the glass from steve and began talking this thing sticking out of my pocket he said is a warrant just so a mystery plot man like you gets all the gimmicks straight well brief it you couldnt make up your mind could you you kept quoting how happy could i be with either only theres another quote that starts like that it was groucho marx who said how happy i could be with either of these women if only both of them would go away and thats the decision you reached you were going to pieces and what a nice simple life you could have if only you werent bothered with either harriet or lynn no more problems no decisions no impingements just you alone in your insufficient selfsufficiency steve said if i had that glass back i could think better you dont want things outside yourself but you cant live without them youve found that out by now havent you ok take the glass and take the proof theres been too much written about poisoned chocolates nobodyd eat an anonymous gift nowadaysespecially no one close to a gimmickconscious man like you unless they were reassured stupid of me darling i forgot to put in the card and whos the only person who immediately or by phone could reassure both harriet and lynn and the best proof crime must have a stop a full stop the typewriter was almost certainly the one in your study but that proved nothing anybody couldve used itmiss mcveagh your mother but typing habits are something else and typists are divided into those who do and do not put a period a full stop after abbreviations like mr and mrs i saw a letter of mcveaghs she wrote mr harriettm r period i saw a note from your mother she wrote mr noblem r period i saw a note from you you wrote dr ferdinand wahrscheind r no period and the murder labels were both addressed mrsm r s no period the d all want to know where the strychnine came from ill make a guess your mothers a semiinvalid i gather maybe hearttrouble maybe using strychnine maybe missing a few tablets lately lieutenant macdonald had never seen anyone wring her hands before but there was no other description for what mrs harnett was doing i have noticed she struggled to say twice recently ive had to have a prescription refilled before i needed to steve gulped and set his glass down hitting it too hard don he choked out minute in the bathroom then you can he gestured at the warrant you must understand lieutenant mrs harnett began as steve left it isnt as if my stephen were like other men this isnt an ordinary case of course i have to tell the truth when it comes to something like the strychnine but a dim fear clutched at lieutenant macdonald as he callously shoved past the old lady toward the bathroom he threw open the unlatched door stephen harnett stood there by the basin macdonald remembered mcveaghs description his hands are shaking and his eyes look like hes going to cry his trembling fingers were unable to bring the razor blade functionally close to the veins of his wrist the blade slipped from his hand and clattered into the bowl as he turned and surrendered to the law hell never have to make another decision of his own macdonald said to nick noble when he dropped into the chula negra after his testimony on the first day of the trial from now on its all up to his lawyers and the state i think he likes it of course theyve made that nonsensical double plea not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity in other words i didnt do it but if i did you cant hurt me it may stick i think hell like it better if it doesnt is he noble wondered into his glass i dont know whats sane like the majority of people then no murderers sane the majority arent murderers but the big trouble is with the people who are almost like the majority the people you cant tell from anybody else till the push comes which they cant take the people who could be the guy in the next apartment the gal in the same bed or me so whos sane whos the majority maybe the majority is the people who havent been pushed nick noble opened his pale blue eyes to their widest youre growing up mac he said and finished his sherry hopefully ed mcbain b he was born salvatore a lombino in an impoverished new york city neighbourhood but he has written under the names ezra hannon richard marstan evan hunter and ed mcbainthe last two of which made him famous mcbain studied at both the new york city art students league and cooper union art school on scholarships but even then his love was writing after service on a destroyer during world war ii he switched to hunter college to earn a degree in english and membership in phi beta kapa mcbain worked as a lobster salesman and a substitute teacher among other jobs and published scores of short stories and three novels before the blackboard jungle written as evan hunter brought him financial success in remarkably prolific he also has written two plays four film scripts two television plays and a number of books for children but his fame and his reputation rest principally on his eightyseventh precinct series which began in with the publication of cop hater these novelsmany of which feature steve carela the precincts chief detective but often focus on other members of the forcewon for mcbain the grand master award of the mystery writers of america and a reputation among his peers as the preeminent creator of the policeprocedural form his plots focus on the crime and on the exhausting work required of lawmen to catch the criminal mcbain makes his policemen human with lives outside their duty and he peoples the streets with minor characters who are interesting because he makes them real the eightyseventh precinct works with their multiple story lines require the length of the novel form but a similar atmosphere is depicted in many of mcbains short stories while it does not use the characters who made the eightyseventh precinct famous small homicide is illustrative of mcbains keen knowledge of the details of police work and of the human misery that lies behind so many crimes it stands as the prime example of a police procedural that induces an overwhelming sensation of pity in the reader small homicide her face was small and chubby the eyes blue and innocently rounded but seeing nothing her body rested on the seat of the wooden bench one arm twisted awkwardly beneath her the candles near the altar flickered and cast their dancing shadows on her face there was a faded pink blanket wrapped around her and against the whiteness of her throat were the purple bruises that told us shed been strangled her mouth was open exposing two small teeth and the beginnings of a third she was no more than eight months old the church was quiet and immense with earlymorning sunlight lighting the stainedglass windows dust motes filtered down the long slanting columns of sunlight and father barren stood tall and darkly sombre at the end of the pew the sun touching his hair like an angels kiss this is the way you found her father i asked yes just that way the priests eyes were a deep brown against the chalky whiteness of his face i didnt touch her pat travers scratched his jaw and stood up reaching for the pad in his back pocket his mouth was set in a tight angry line pat had three children of his own what time was this father at about fivethirty we have six oclock mass and i came out to see that the altar was prepared our altar boys go to school you understand and they usually arrive at the last moment i generally attend to the altar myself no sexton pat asked yes we have a sexton but he doesnt arrive until about eight every morning he comes earlier on sundays i nodded while pat jotted the information in his pad how did you happen to see her father i was walking to the back of the church to open the doors i saw something in the pew and i well at first i thought it was just a package someone had forgotten when i came closer i saw it was was a baby he sighed deeply and shook his head the doors were locked father no no theyre never locked this is gods house you know they were simply closed i was walking back to open them i usually open them before the first mass in the morning they were unlocked all night yes of course i see i looked down at the baby again you you wouldnt know who she is would you father father barron shook his head again im afraid not she may have been baptized here but infants all look alike you know it would be different if i saw her every sunday but he spread his hands wide in a helpless gesture pat nodded and kept looking at the dead child well have to send some of the boys to take pictures and prints father i hope you dont mind and well have to chalk up the pew it shouldnt take too long and well have the body out as soon as possible father barron looked down at the dead baby he crossed himself then and said god have mercy on her soul i was sipping at my hot coffee when the buzzer on my desk sounded i pushed down the toggle and said levine here dave want to come into my office a minute this is the lieutenant sure thing i told him i put down the cup and said be right back to pat and headed for the skippers office he was

in his hands mumbled uhm and then said while youre waiting youd better start checking the missing persons calls pats doing that now sir good good you know what to do dave just get me an answer to it fast well do our best sir he leaned back in his leather chair a little girl huh he shook his head damn shame damn shame he kept shaking his head and looking at the report and then he dropped the

gone they found the kid pat said her older daughter had simply taken the kid for a walk theres nothing there dave the skipper wants action pat the photos come in yet over there he indicated a pile of

the baby was stretched out on the long white table when i went down to see doc edwards a sheet covered the corpse and doc was busy typing up a report i looked over his shoulder police department city

he said nothing dave nothing at all we split the available force of men and i managed to wangle four more men from the lieutenant half of us began checking on the dreisers listed in the phone directory and the rest of us began checking the diaper services the first diaper place i called on had a manager who needed only a beard to look like santa claus he greeted me affably and offered all his assistance unfortunately theyd never had a customer named alice dreiser at my fourth stop i got what looked like a lead i spoke directly to the vicepresident and he listened intently perhaps he said perhaps he was a big man with a wide waist a gold watch chain straddling it he leaned over and pushed down on his intercom buzzer yes sir bring in a list of our customers starting with november of sir starting with november of yes sir we chatted about the diaper business in general until the list came and then he handed it to me and i began checking off the names there were a hell of a lot of names on it for the month of december i found a listing for alice dreiser the address given was the one wed checked in the bronx here she is i said can you get her records the vicepresident looked at the name certainly just a moment he buzzed his secretary again told her what he wanted and she brought the yellow file cards in a few minutes later the cards told me that alice dreiser had continued the diaper service through february shed been late on her february payment and had cancelled service in march shed had the diapers delivered for the first week in march but had not paid for them she did not notify the company that she was moving she had not returned the diapers theyd sent her that first week in march the company did not know where she was if you find her the vicepresident told me id like to know she owes us money ill keep that in mind i said the reports on the dreisers were waiting for me back at the precinct george had found a couple who claimed to be carls aunt and uncle they knew he was married they gave alices maiden name as grant they said she lived somewhere on walton avenue in the bronx or at least had lived there when carl first met her they hadnt seen either her or carl for months yes they knew the dreisers had had a daughter theyd received an announcement card they had never seen the baby pat and i looked up the grants on walton avenue found a listing for peter grant and went there together a bald man in his undershirt his suspenders hanging over his trousers opened the door what is it he asked police officers i said wed like to ask a few questions what about let me see your badges pat and i flashed our buzzers and the bald man studied them what kind of questions do you want to ask are you peter grant yeah thats right whats this all about may we come in sure come on in we followed him into the apartment and he motioned us to chairs in the small living room now what is it he asked your daughter is alice dreiser yes he said do

business anyway her daughter had her neck broken i said it is our business i dont give a he started to say he stopped then and looked straight ahead of him his brows pulled together into a tight frown im sorry i still dont know where she lives did you know she was married to that sailor yes i knew and you knew she had a daughter dont make me laugh grant said whats funny mister pat said did i know she had a daughter why the hell do you think she married the sailor dont make me laugh when was your daughter married mr grant last september he saw the look on my face and added go ahead you count it

know who did it yet maybe she did grant said softly she just maybe did ill get you the picture he came back in a few minutes with a picture of a plain girl wearing a cap and gown she had light eyes and straight hair and her face was intently serious she favours her mother grant said god rest her soul your wife is dead yes that picture was taken when alice graduated high school she graduated in june and married the sailor in september shes shes only just nineteen now you know may we have this he hesitated and said its the only one ive got she she didnt take many pictures she wasnt a very pretty kid well return it all right he said his eyes began to blink she if shes in trouble youll youll let me know wont you well let you know kids kids make mistakes sometimes he stood up abruptly let me know we had copies of the photo made and then we staked out every church in the neighbourhood in which the baby was found pat and i covered the church of the holy mother because we figured the suspect was most likely to come back there we didnt talk much there is something about a church of any denomination that makes a man think rather than talk pat and i knocked off at about seven every night and the night boys took over then we were back on the job at seven in the morning every morning it was a week before she came in she was a thin girl with the body of a child and a pinched tired face she stopped at the font in the rear of the church dipped her hand in the holy water and crossed herself then she walked to the altar stopped before an idol of the virgin mary lighted a candle and knelt before it thats her i said lets go pat answered not here outside pats eyes locked with mine for an instant sure he said she knelt before the idol for a long time and then got to her feet slowly drying her eyes she walked up the aisle stopped at the font crossed herself and then walked outside we followed her out catching up with her at the corner i pulled up on one side of her and pat on the other mrs dreiser i asked she stopped walking yes i showed my buzzer police officers i said wed like to ask some questions she stared at my face for a long time she drew a trembling breath then and said i killed her i carl was dead you see i i guess that was it it wasnt righthis getting killed i mean and she was crying she nodded blankly yes that was it she just cried all the time not knowing that i was crying inside you dont know how i cried inside carl he was all i had i i couldnt stand it anymore i told her to shut up and when she didnt i i come on now mam i said i brought her to the church she nodded remembering it all now she was innocent you know so i brought her to the church did you find her there yes mam i said thats where we found her she seemed pleased a small smile covered her mouth and she said im glad you found her she told the story again to the lieutenant pat and i checked out and on the way to the subway i asked him do you still want to pull the switch pat he didnt answer ross macdonald ross macdonald was the intellectual of american detective fiction an honours graduate with a doctorate in literature and a master of the simile he might also be called the poet of the dysfunctional family the abandoned child and the sins of the father bearing fruit in later generations his peers gave macdonald almost every honour the genre has to offerincluding the mystery writers of americas grand master award the gold dagger of the british crime writers the lifetime achievement award of the private eye writers of america and the popular culture associations award for excellence macdonald was born as kenneth millar an only child in los gatos california the family moved to vancouver british columbia there the father abandoned his wife and child when the latter was three and the boy spent his formative years living with various relatives his first story was published when he was a teenage student in ontario the same edition of the magazine published a story by another student margaret sturm the two were married after his graduation from college as kenneth millar macdonald wrote short fiction and four novels which gained little attention before inventing lew archer in the moving target in since his wife margaret millar had already established herself as an author he published the moving target under the name john macdonald to avoid confusion with the writer john d macdonald he then wrote as john ross macdonald and beginning in used only the pen name ross macdonald macdonalds protagonist archer is a private investigator in the line of dashiell hammetts sam spade and raymond chandlers philip marlowe in him spades hardedged cryptic cynicism and marlowes moral romanticism are replaced with a sort of sympathetic applied psychology archer finds his solutions to crimes less in the physical evidence of bloodstains hairs and footprints than in the damaged lives of the victims family in many of macdonalds books the violence under investigation is traced back a generation or two to a family abandonment or betrayal one thinks of macdonalds own life and remembers that he once said that the fictional sleuth is the authors way of dealing with emotional material too hard to handle otherwise whatever the driving force behind his work it opened the gates to more and better psychological detective fiction guiltedged blonde a typical macdonald story gives us a crime in a dysfunctional family and a look at the skill with language that made the author famous the man who meets archers plane wore a stained tan windbreaker baggy slacks a hat as squashed and dubious as his face more typical of macdonalds style his eyes were dark and evasive moving here and there as if to avoid getting hurt he had been hurt often and badly i guessed only chandler could have said it better guiltedged blonde a man was waiting for me at the gate at the edge of the runway he didnt look like the man i expected to meet he wore a stained tan windbreaker baggy slacks a hat as squashed and dubious as his face he must have been forty years old to judge by the gray in his hair and the lines around his eyes his eyes were dark and evasive moving here and there as if to avoid getting hurt he had been hurt often and badly i guessed you archer i said i was i offered him my hand he didnt know what to do with it he regarded it suspiciously as if i was planning to try a judo hold on him he kept his hands in the pockets of his windbreaker im harry nemo his voice was a grudging whine it cost him an effort to give his name away my brother told me to come and pick you up you ready to go as soon as i get my luggage i collected my overnight bag at the counter in the empty waiting room the bag was very heavy for its size it contained besides a toothbrush and spare linen two guns and the ammunition for them a special for sudden work and a automatic as a spare harry nemo took me outside to his car it was a new sevenpassenger custom job as long and black as death the windshield and side windows were very thick and they had the yellowish tinge of bulletproof glass are you expecting to be shot at not me his smile was dismal this is nicks car why didnt nick come himself he looked around the deserted field the plane i had arrived on was a flashing speck in the sky above the red sun the only human being in sight was the operator in the control tower but nemo leaned towards me in the seat and spoke in a whisper nicks a scared pigeon hes scared to leave the house ever since this morning what happened this morning didnt he tell you you talked to him on the phone he didnt say very much he told me he wanted to hire a bodyguard for six days until his boat sails he didnt tell me why theyre gunning for him thats why he went to the beach this morning he has a private beach along the back of his ranch and he went down there by himself for his morning dip somebody took a shot at him from the top of the bluff five or six shots he was in the water see with no gun handy he told me the slugs were splashing around him like hailstones he ducked and swam under water out to sea lucky for him hes a good swimmer or he wouldnt of got away its no wonder hes scared it means they caught up with him see who are they or is that a family secret nemo turned from the wheel to peer into my face his breath was sour his look incredulous christ dont you know who nick is didnt he tell you hes a lemongrower isnt he he is now what did he used to be the bitter beaten face closed on itself i oughtnt to be flapping at the mouth he can tell you himself if he wants to two hundred horses yanked us away from the curb i rode with my heavy leather bag on my knees nemo drove as if driving was the one thing in life he enjoyed rapt in silent communion with the engine it whisked us along the highway then down a gradual incline between geometrically planted lemon groves the sunset sea glimmered red at the foot of the slope before we reached it we turned off the blacktop into a private lane which ran like a straight hairparting between the dark green trees straight for half a mile or more to a low house in a clearing the house was flatroofed made of concrete and fieldstone with an attached garage all of its windows were blinded with heavy draperies it was surrounded with wellkept shrubbery and lawn the lawn with a tenfoot wire fence surmounted by barbed wire nemo stopped in front of the closed and padlocked gate and honked the horn there was no response he honked the horn again about halfway between the house and the gate a crawling thing came out of the shrubbery it was a man moving very slowly on hands and knees his head hung down almost to the ground one side of his head was bright red as if he had fallen in paint he left a jagged red trail in the gravel of the driveway harry nemo said nick he scrambled out of the car what happened nick the crawling man lifted his heavy head and looked at us cumbrously he rose to his feet he came forward with his legs spraddled and loose like a huge infant learning to walk he breathed loudly and horribly looking at us with a dreadful hopefulness then he died on his feet still walking i saw the change in his face before it struck the gravel harry nemo went over the fence like a weary monkey snagging his slacks on the barbed wire he knelt beside his brother and turned him over and palmed his chest he stood up shaking his head i had my bag unzipped and my hand on the revolver i went to the gate open up harry harry was saying they got him over and over he crossed himself several times the dirty bastards open up i said he found a key ring in the dead mans pocket and opened the padlocked gate our dragging footsteps crunched the gravel i looked down at the specks of gravel in nicky nemos eyes the bullet hole in the temple who got him harry i dunno fats jordan or artie castola or faronese it must have been one of them the purple gang you called it nicky was their treasurer back in the thirties he was the one that didnt get into the papers he handled the payoff see when the heat went on and the gang got busted up he had some money in a safe deposit box he was the only one that got away how much money nicky never told me all i know he come out here before the war and bought a thousand acres of lemon land it took them fifteen years to catch up with him he always knew they were gonna though he knew it artie castola got off the rock last spring youre telling me thats when nicky bought himself the bulletproof car and put up the fence are they gunning for you he looked around at the darkening groves and the sky the sky was streaked with running red as if the sun had died a violent death i dunno he answered nervously they got no reason to im as clean as soap i never been in the rackets not since i was young anyway the wife made me go straight see i said we better get into the house and call the police the front door was standing a few inches ajar i could see at the edge that it was sheathed with quarterinch steel plate harry put my thoughts into words why in hell would he go outside he was safe as houses as long as he stayed inside did he live alone more or less alone what does that mean he pretended not to hear me but i got some kind of an answer looking through the doorless arch into the living room i saw a leopardskin coat folded across the back of the chesterfield there were redtipped cigarette butts mingled with cigar butts in the ash trays nicky was married not exactly you know the woman naw but he was lying somewhere behind the thick walls of the house there was a creak of springs a crashing bump the broken roar of a cold engine grinding of tires in gravel i got to the door in time to see a cerise convertible hurtling down the driveway the top was down and a yellowhaired girl was small and intent at the wheel she swerved around nicks body and got through the gate somehow with her tires screaming i aimed at the right rear tire and missed harry came up behind me he pushed my gunarm down before i could fire again the convertible disappeared in the direction of the highway let her go he said who is she he thought about it his slow brain clicking almost audibly i dunno some pig that nicky picked up some place her name is flossie or florrie or something she didnt shoot him if thats what youre worried about you know her pretty well do you the hell i do i dont mess with nickys dames he tried to work up a rage to go with the strong words but he didnt have the makings the best he could produce was petulance listen mister why should you hang around the guy that hired you is dead i havent been paid for one thing ill fix that he trotted across the lawn to the body and came back with an alligator billfold it was thick with money how much a hundred will do it he handed me a hundreddollar bill now how about you amscray bud before the law gets here i need transportation take nickys car he wont be using it you can park it at the airport and leave the key with the agent i can eh sure im telling you you can arent you getting a little free with your brothers property its my property now bud a bright thought struck him disorganising his face incidentally how would you like to get off my land im staying harry i like this place i always say its people that make a place the gun was still my hand he looked down at it get on the telephone harry call the police who do you think you are ordering me around i took my last order from anybody see he glanced over his shoulder at the dark and shapeless object on the gravel and spat venomously im a citizen working for nicky not for you he changed his tune very suddenly how much to go to work for me depends on the line of work he manipulated the alligator wallet heres another hundred if you got to hang around keep the lip buttoned down about the dame eh is it a deal i didnt answer but i took the money i put it in a separate pocket by itself harry telephoned the county sheriff he emptied the ash trays before the sheriffs men arrived and stuffed the leopardskin coat into the woodbox i sat and watched him we spent the next two hours with loudmouthed deputies they were angry with the dead man for having the kind of past that attracted bullets they were angry with harry for being his brother they were secretly angry with themselves for being inexperienced and incompetent they didnt even uncover the leopardskin coat harry nemo left for the courthouse first i waited for him to leave and followed him home on foot where a leaning palm tree reared its ragged head above the pavements there was a court lined with jerrybuilt frame cottages harry turned up the walk between them and entered the first cottage light flashed on his face from inside i heard a womans voice say something to him then light and sound were cut off by the closing door an old gabled house with boardedup windows stood opposite the court i crossed the street and settled down in the shadows of its veranda to watch harry nemos cottage three cigarettes later a tall woman in a dark hat and a light coat came out of the cottage and walked briskly to the corner and out of sight two cigarettes after that she reappeared at the corner on my side of the street still walking briskly i noticed that she had a large straw handbag under her arm her face was long and stony under the streetlight leaving the street she marched up the broken sidewalk to the veranda where i was leaning against the shadowed wall the stairs groaned under her decisive footsteps i put my hand on the gun in my pocket and waited with the rigid assurance of a wac corporal marching at the head of her platoon she crossed the veranda to me a thin highshouldered silhouette against the light from the corner her hand was in her straw bag and the end of the bag was pointed at my stomach her shadowed face was a gleam of eyes a glint of teeth i wouldnt try it if i were you she said i have a gun here and the safety is off and i know how to shoot it mister congratulations im not joking her deep contralto rose a notch rapid fire used to be my specialty so you better take your hands out of your pockets i showed her my hands empty moving very quickly she relieved my pocket of the weight of my gun and frisked me for other weapons who are you mister she said as she stepped back you cant be arturo castola youre not old enough are you a policewoman ill ask the questions what are you doing here waiting for a friend youre a liar youve been watching my house for an hour and a half i tabbed you through the window so you went and bought yourself a gun i did you followed harry home im mrs nemo and i want to know why harrys the friend im waiting for youre a double liar harrys afraid of you youre no friend of his that depends on harry im a detective she snorted very likely wheres your buzzer im a private detective i said i have identification in my wallet show me and dont try any tricks i produced my photostat she held it up to the light from the street and handed it back to me so youre a detective you better do something about your tailing technique its obvious i didnt know i was dealing with a cop i was a cop she said not any more then give me back my it cost me seventy dollars first tell me whats your interest in my husband who hired you nick your brotherinlaw he called me in los angeles today said he needed a bodyguard for a week didnt harry tell you she didnt answer by the time i got to nick he didnt need a bodyguard or anything but i thought id stick around and see what i could find out about his death he was a client after all you should pick your clients more carefully what about picking brothersinlaw she shook her head stiffly the hair that escaped from under her hat was almost white im not responsible for nick or anything about him harry is my responsibility i met him in line of duty and i straightened him out understand i tore him loose from detroit and the rackets and i brought him out here i couldnt cut him off from his brother entirely but he hasnt been in trouble since i married him not once until now harry isnt in trouble now not yet not officially what do you mean give me my gun and put yours down i cant talk into iron she hesitated a grim and anxious woman under pressure i wondered what quirk of fate or psychology had married her to a hood and decided it must have been love only love would send a woman across a dark street to face down an unknown gunman mrs nemo was horsefaced and aging and not pretty but she had courage she handed me my gun its butt was soothing to the palm of my hand i dropped it into my pocket a gang of negro boys at loose ends went by in the street hooting and whistling purposelessly she leaned towards me almost as tall as i was her voice was a low sibilance forced between her teeth harry had nothing to do with his brothers death youre crazy if you think so what makes you so sure mrs nemo harry couldnt thats all i know harry i can read him like a book even if he had the guts which he hasnt he wouldnt dare to think of killing nick nick was his older brother understand the successful one in the family her voice rasped contemptuously in spite of everything i could do or say harry worshipped nick right up to the end those brotherly feelings sometimes cut two ways and harry had a lot to gain not a cent nothing hes nicks heir isnt he not as long as he stays married to me i wouldnt let him touch a cent of nick nemos filthy money is that clear its clear to me but is it clear to harry i made it clear to him many times anyway this is ridiculous harry wouldnt lay a finger on that precious brother of his maybe he didnt do it himself he could have had it done for him i know hes covering for somebody who a blonde girl left the house after we arrived she got away in a cherrycoloured convertible harry recognized her a cherrycoloured convertible yes does that mean something to you no nothing in particular she must have been one of nicks girls he always had girls why would harry cover for her what do you mean cover for her she left a leopardskin coat behind harry hid it and paid me not to tell the police harry did that unless im having delusions maybe you are at that if you think that harry paid that girl to shoot nick or had anything i know dont say it im crazy mrs nemo laid a thin hand on my arm anyway lay off harry please i have a hard enough time handling him as it is hes worse than my first husband the first one was a drunk believe it or not she glanced at the lighted cottage across the street and i saw one half of her bitter smile i wonder what makes a woman go for the lame ducks the way i did i wouldnt know mrs nemo okay i lay off harry but i had no intention of laying off harry when she went back to her cottage i walked around threequarters of the block and took up a new position in the doorway of a drycleaning establishment this time i didnt smoke i didnt even move except to look at my watch from time to time around eleven oclock the lights went out behind the blinds in the nemo cottage shortly before midnight the front door opened and harry slipped out he looked up and down the street and began to walk he passed within six feet of my dark doorway hustling along in a kind of furtive shuffle working very cautiously at a distance i tailed him downtown he disappeared into the lighted cavern of an all night garage he came out of the garage a few minutes later driving a prewar chevrolet my money also talked to the attendant i drew a prewar buick which would still do seventyfive i proved that it would as soon as i hit the highway i reached the entrance to nick nemos private lane in time to see harrys lights approaching the dark ranch house i cut my lights and parked at the roadside a hundred yards below the entrance to the lane and facing it the chevrolet reappeared in a few minutes harry was still alone in the front seat i followed it blind as far as the highway before i risked my lights then down the highway to the edge of town in the middle of the motel and drivein district he turned off onto a side road and in under a neon sign which spelled out trailer court across the darkness the trailers stood along the bank of a dry creek the chevrolet stopped in front of one of them which had a light in the window harry got out with a spotted bundle under his arm he knocked on the door of the trailer i uturned at the next corner and put in more waiting time the chevrolet rolled out under the neon sign and turned towards the highway i let it go leaving my car i walked along the creek bank to the lighted trailer the windows were curtained the cerise convertible was parked on its far side i tapped on the aluminum door harry a girls voice said is that you harry i muttered something indistinguishable the door opened and the yellowhaired girl looked out she was very young but her round blue eyes were heavy and sick with hangover or remorse she had on a nylon slip nothing else what is this she tried to shut the door i held it open get away from here leave me alone ill scream all right scream she opened her mouth no sound came out she closed her mouth again it was small and fleshy and defiant who are you law close enough im coming in come in then damn you i got nothing to hide i can see that i brushed in past her there were dead martinis on her breath the little room was a jumble of feminine clothes silk and cashmere and tweed and gossamer nylon some of them flung on the floor others hung up to dry the leopardskin coat lay on the bunk bed staring with innumerable bold eyes she picked it up and covered her shoulders with it unconsciously her nervous hands began to pick the woodchips out of the fur i said harry did you a favour didnt he maybe he did have you been doing any favours for harry such as such as knocking off his brother youre way off the beam mister i was very fond of uncle nick why run out on the killing then i panicked she said it would happen to any girl i was asleep when he got it see passed out if you want the truth i heard the gun go off it woke me up but it took me quite a while to bring myself to and sober up enough to put my clothes on by the time i made it to the bedroom window harry was back with some guy she peered into my face were you the guy i nodded i thought so i thought you were the law at the time i saw nick lying there in the driveway all bloody and i put two and two together and got trouble bad trouble for me unless i got out so i got out it wasnt nice to do after what nick meant to me but it was the only sensible thing i got my career to think of what career is that modelling acting uncle nick was gonna send me to school unless you talk youll finish your education at corona who shot nick a thin edge of terror entered her voice i dont know i tell you i was passed out in the bedroom i didnt see nothing why did harry bring you your coat he didnt want me to get involved hes my father after all harry nemo is your father yes youll have to do better than that whats your name jeannine jeannine larue why isnt your name nemo if harry is your father why do you call him harry hes my stepfather i mean sure i said and nick was really your uncle and you were having a family reunion with him he wasnt any blood relation to me i always called him uncle though if harrys your father why dont you live with him i used to honest this is the truth im telling you i had to get out on account of the old lady the old lady hates my guts shes a real creep a square she cant stand for a girl to have any fun just because my old man was a rummy whats your idea of fun jeannine she shook her feathercut hair at me it exhaled a heavy perfume which was worth its weight in blood she bared one pearly shoulder and smiled an artificial hustlers smile whats yours maybe we can get together you mean the way you got together with nick youre prettier than him im also smarter i hope is harry really your stepfather ask him if you dont believe me ask him he lives in a place on tule streeti dont remember the number i know where he lives but harry wasnt at home i knocked on the door of the frame cottage and got no answer i turned the knob and found that the door was unlocked there was a light behind it the other cottages in the court were dark it was long past midnight and the street was deserted i went into the cottage preceded by my gun a ceiling bulb glared down on sparse and threadbare furniture a timeeaten rug besides the living room the house contained a cubbyhole of a bedroom and a closet kitchenette everything in the povertystricken place was pathetically clean there were moral mottoes on the walls and one picture it was a photograph of a towheaded girl in a teenage party dress jeannine before she learned that a pretty face and a sleek body could buy her the things she wanted the things she thought she wanted for some reason i felt sick i went outside somewhere out of sight an old carengine muttered its muttering grew on the night harry nemos rented chevrolet turned the corner under the streetlight its front wheels were weaving one of the wheels climbed the curb in front of the cottage the chevrolet came to a halt at a drunken angle i crossed the sidewalk and opened the car door harry was at the wheel clinging to it desperately as if he needed it to hold him up his chest was bloody his mouth was bright with blood he spoke through it thickly she got me who got you harry jeannine no not her she was the reason for it though we had it coming those were his final words i caught his body as it fell sideways out of the seat i laid it out on the sidewalk and left it for the cop on the beat to find i drove across town to the trailer court jeannines trailer still had light in it filtered through the curtains over the windows i pushed the door open the girl was packing a suitcase on the bunk bed she looked at me over her shoulder and froze her blonde head was cocked like a frightened birds hypnotized by my gun where are you off to kid out of this town im getting out you have some talking to do first she straightened up i told you all i know you didnt believe me whats the matter didnt you get to see harry i saw him harrys dead your whole family is dying like flies she halfturned and sat down limply on the disordered bed dead you think i did it i think you know who did harry said before he died that you were the reason for it all me the reason for it her eyes widened in false naiveté but there was thought behind them quick and desperate thought you mean that harry got killed on account of me harry and nick both it was a woman who shot them god she said the desperate thought behind her eyes crystallised into knowledge which i shared the aching silence was broken by a big diesel rolling by on the highway she said above its roar that crazy old bat so she killed nick youre talking about your mother mrs nemo yeah did you see her shoot him no i was blotto like i told you but i saw her out there this week keeping an eye on the house shes always watched me like a hawk is that why you were getting out of town because you knew she killed nick maybe it was i dont know i wouldnt let myself think about it her blue gaze shifted from my face to something behind me i turned mrs nemo was in the doorway she was hugging the straw bag to her thin chest her right hand dove into the bag i shot her in the right arm she leaned against the doorframe and held her dangling arm with her left hand her face was granite in whose crevices her eyes were like live things caught the gun she dropped was a cheap revolver its nickel plating worn and corroded i spun the cylinder one shot had been fired from it this accounts for harry i said you didnt shoot nick with this gun not at that distance no she was looking down at her dripping hand i used my old police gun on nick nemo after i killed him i threw the gun into the sea i didnt know id have further use for a gun i bought that little suicide gun tonight to use on harry to use on you i thought you were on to me i didnt know until you told me that harry knew about nick and jeannine jeannine is your daughter by your first husband my only daughter she said to the girl i did it for you jeannine ive seen too muchthe awful things that can happen the girl didnt answer i said i can understand why you shot nick but why did harry have to die nick paid him she said nick paid him for jeannine i found harry in a bar an hour ago and he admitted it i hope i killed him you killed him mrs nemo what brought you here was jeannine the third on your list no no shes my own girl i came to tell her what i did for her i wanted her to know she looked at the girl on the bed her eyes were terrible with pain and love the girl said in a stunned voice mother youre hurt im sorry lets go mrs nemo i said rex stout rex stouts great sleuthing team nero wolfe and archie goodwin is often compared with the sherlock holmes and dr john h watson duo of sir arthur conan doyle there are many similarities both pairs share digs at addresses so real to their readers that they draw aficionados to their doors both masterminds are unmarried and with rare exceptions shun women both sleuths are eccentric geniuses who solve mysteries in the tradition of edgar allan foes chevalier auguste dupin by remarkable powers of reasoning but the greatest similarity between the teams is that both succeed in becoming so real to their readers that the characters take on lives of their own the differences are also obvious unlike the lanky holmes wolfe is literally larger than life his girth and his inclination to reclusiveness and physical inactivity lead him to hire sidekick archie goodwin to do his legwork goodwin is much more than a passive and admiring narrator he is the professional collector of data and doer of dangerous deeds freeing wolfe to stay home to nurture his orchids as faithfully as wilkie collinss sergeant cuff of the moonstone nurtured his roses more important goodwins telling of the tale is spiced by his irritation and disgruntlement with his employer and friend this and the gallery of lively characters who populate the tales add considerably to the interest of the puzzle that stout creates named a grand master by the mystery writers of america stout was a downright excellent writer he came by that skill as all writers doby reading he was born in indiana but raised in a kansas farmhouse that had more than a thousand books on its shelves all of which he says he had read by his eleventh birthday he was a talented student with a great memory and a love of poetry and politics stout was already fortyeight when he published ferdelance in and gave the world wolfe and goodwin before this he founded a schoolbanking system and published eight mainstream novels but his forte fame and fortune lay in detective fiction stout may have written christmas party to satisfy the demand of magazine editors for such material for the holiday season at the same time however it gave him a creditable way to have wolfe break his habits of reclusiveness and leave his brownstone on business and to celebrate as detective fiction so often does the power of cerebration and of friendship between men christmas party i im sorry sir i said i tried to sound sorry but i told you two days ago monday that i had a date for friday afternoon and you said all right so ill drive you to long island saturday or sunday nero wolfe shook his head that wont do mr thompsons ship docks friday morning and he will be at mr hewitts place only until saturday noon when he leaves for new orleans as you know he is the best hybridizer in england and i am grateful to mr hewitt for inviting me to spend a few hours with him as i remember the drive takes about an hour and a half so we should leave at twelvethirty i decided to count ten and swivelled my chair facing my desk so as to have privacy for it as usual when we have no important case going we had been getting on each others nerves for a week and i admit i was a little touchy but his taking it for granted like that was a little too much when i had finished the count i turned my head to where he was perched on this throne behind his desk and darned if he hadnt gone back to his book making it plain that he regarded it as settled that was much too much i swivelled my chair to confront him i really am sorry i said not trying to sound sorry but i have to keep that date friday afternoon its a christinas party at the office of kurt bottweillyou remember him we did a job for him a few months ago the stolen tapestries you may not remember a member of his staff named margot dickey but i do i have been seeing her some and i promised her id go to the party we never have a christmas office party here as for going to long island your idea that a car is a death trap if im not driving it is unsound you can take a taxi or hire a baxter man or get saul panzer to drive you wolfe had lowered his book i hope to get some useful information from mr thompson and you will take notes not if im not there hewitts secretary knows orchid terms as well as i do so do you i admit those last three words were a bit strong but he shouldnt have gone back to his book his lips tightened archie how many times in the past year have i asked you to drive me somewhere if you call it asking maybe eighteen or twenty not excessive surely if my feeling that you alone are to be trusted at the wheel of a car is an aberration i have it we will leave for mr hewitts place friday at twelvethirty so there we were i took a breath but i didnt need to count ten again if he was to be taught a lesson and he certainly needed one luckily i had in my possession a document that would make it good reaching to my inside breast pocket i took out a folded sheet of paper i didnt intend i told him to spring this on you until tomorrow or maybe even later but i guess it will have to be now just as well i suppose i left my chair unfolded the paper and handed it to him he put his book down to take it gave it a look shot a glance at me looked at the paper again and let it drop on his desk he snorted pfui what flummery is this no flummery as you see its a marriage license for archie goodwin and margot dickey it cost me two bucks i could be mushy about it but i wont i will only say that if i am hooked at last it took an expert she intends to spread the tidings at the christmas office party and of course i have to be there when you announce you have caught a fish it helps to have the fish present in person frankly i would prefer to drive you to long island but it cant be done the effect was all i could have asked he gazed at me through narrowed eyes long enough to count eleven then picked up the document and gazed at it he flicked it from him to the edge of the desk as if it were crawling with germs and focused on me again you are deranged he said evenly and distinctly sit down i nodded i suppose i agreed remaining upright its a form of madness but so what if ive got it like what margot was reading to me the other nightsome poet i think it was some greeko love resistless in thy might thou triumphest even shut up and sit down yes sir i didnt move but were not rushing it we havent set the date and therell be plenty of time to decide on adjustments you may not want me here any more but thats up to you as far as im concerned i would like to stay my long association with you has had its flaws but i would hate to end it the pay is okay especially if i get a raise the first of the year which is a week from monday i have grown to regard this old brownstone as my home although you own it and although there are two creaky boards in the floor of my room i appreciate working for the greatest private detective in the free world no matter how eccentric he is i appreciate being able to go up to the plant rooms whenever i feel like it and look at ten thousand orchids especially the odontoglossums i fully appreciate sit down im too worked up to sit i fully appreciate fritzs cooking i like the billiard table in the basement i like west thirtyfifth street i like the oneway glass panel in the front door i like this rug im standing on i like your favourite colour yellow i have told margot all this and more including the fact that you are allergic to women we have discussed it and we think it may be worth trying say for a month when we get back from the honeymoon my room could be our bedroom and the other room on that floor could be our living room there are plenty of closets we could eat with you as i have been or we could eat up there as you prefer if the trial works out new furniture or redecorating would be up to us she will keep her job with kurt bottweill so she wouldnt be here during the day and since hes an interior decorator we would get things wholesale of course we merely suggest this for your consideration its your house i picked up my marriage license folded it and returned it to my pocket his eyes had stayed narrow and his lips tight i dont believe it he growled what about miss rowan we wont drag miss rowan into this i said stiffly what about the thousands of others you dally with not thousands not even a thousand ill have to look up dally theyll get theirs as margot has got hers as you see im deranged only up to a point i realise sit down no sir i know this will have to be discussed but right now youre stirred up and it would be better to wait for a day or two or maybe more by saturday the idea of a woman in the house may have you boiling even worse than you are now or it may have cooled you down to a simmer if the former no discussion will be needed if the latter you may decide its worth a try i hope you do i turned and walked out in the hall i hesitated i could have gone up to my room and phoned from there but in his present state it was quite possible he would listen in from the desk and the call i wanted to make was personal so i got my hat and coat from the rack let myself out descended the stoop steps walked to the drugstore on ninth avenue found the booth unoccupied and dialled a number in a moment a musical little voicemore a chirp than a voicewas in my ear kurt bottweills studio good morning this is archie goodwin cherry may i speak to margot why certainly just a moment it was a fairly long moment then another voice archie darling yes my own ive got it i knew you could sure i can do anything not only that you said up to a hundred bucks and i thought i would have to part with twenty at least but it only took five and not only that but its on me because ive already had my moneys worth of fun out of it and more ill tell you about it when i see you shall i send it up by messenger no i dont thinkid better come and get it where are you in a phone booth id just as soon not go back to the office right now because mr wolfe wants to be alone to boil so how about the tulip bar at the churchill in twenty minutes i feel like buying you a drink i feel like buying you a drink she should since i was treating her to a marriage license ii when at three oclock friday afternoon i wriggled out of the taxi at the curb in front of the fourstory building in the east sixties it was snowing if it kept up new york might have an offwhite christmas during the two days that had passed since i got my moneys worth from the marriage license the atmosphere around wolfes place had not been very seasonable if we had had a case going frequent and sustained communication would have been unavoidable but without one there was nothing that absolutely had to be said and we said it our handling of that trying period showed our true natures at table for instance i was polite and reserved and spoke when speaking seemed necessary in low and cultured tones when wolfe spoke he either snapped or barked neither of us mentioned the state of bliss i was headed for or the adjustments that would have to be made or my friday date with my fiancée or his trip to long island but he arranged it somehow for precisely at twelvethirty on friday a black limousine drew up in front of the house and wolfe with the brim of his old black hat turned down and the collar of his new gray overcoat turned up for the snow descended the stoop stood massively the mountain of him on the bottom step until the uniformed chauffeur had opened the door and crossed the sidewalk and climbed in i watched it from above from a window of my room i admit i was relieved and felt better he had unquestionably needed a lesson and i didnt regret giving him one but if he had passed up a chance for an orchid powwow with the best hybridizer in england i would never have heard the last of it i went down to the kitchen and ate lunch with fritz who was so upset by the atmosphere that he forgot to put the lemon juice in the soufflé i wanted to console him by telling him that everything would be rosy by christmas only three days off but of course that wouldnt do i had a notion to toss a coin to decide whether i would have a look at the new exhibit of dinosaurs at the natural history museum or go to the bottweill party but i was curious to know how margot was making out with the license and also how the other bottweill personnel were making out with each other it was surprising that they were still making out at all cherry quons position in the setup was apparently minor since she functioned chiefly as a receptionist and phoneanswerer but i had seen her black eyes dart daggers at margot dickey who should have been clear out of her reach i had gathered that it was margot who was mainly relied upon to wrangle prospective customers into the corral that bottweill himself put them under the spell and that alfred kiernans part was to make sure that before the spell wore off an order got signed on the dotted line of course that wasnt all the order had to be filled and that was handled under bottweills supervision by emil hatch in the workshop also funds were required to buy the ingredients and they were furnished by a specimen named mrs perry porter jerome margot had told me that mrs jerome would be at the party and would bring her son leo whom i had never met according to margot leo who had no connection with the bottweill business or any other business devoted his time to two important activities getting enough cash from his mother to keep going as a junior playboy and stopping the flow of cash to bottweill or at least slowing it down it was quite a tangle an interesting exhibit of bipeds alive and kicking and deciding it promised more entertainment than the dead dinosaurs i took a taxi to the east sixties the ground floor of the fourstory building formerly a deluxe doublewidth residence was now a beauty shop the second floor was a realestate office the third floor was kurt bottweills workshop and on top was his studio from the vestibule i took the doityourself elevator to the top opened the door and stepped out into the glossy goldleaf elegance i had first seen some months back when bottweill had hired wolfe to find out who had swiped some tapestries on that first visit i had decided that the only big difference between chrome modern and bottweill goldleaf modern was the colour and i still thought so not even skin deep just a twohundredthousandth of an inch deep but on the panels and racks and furniture frames it gave the big skylighted studio quite a tone and the rugs and drapes and pictures all modern joined in it would have been a fine den for a blind millionaire archie a voice called come and help us sample it was margot dickey in a far corner was a goldleaf bar some eight feet long and she was at it on a goldleaf stool cherry quon and alfred kiernan were with her also on stools and behind the bar was santa claus pouring from a champagne bottle it was certainly a modern touch to have santa claus tend bar but there was nothing modern about his costume he was strictly traditional cut colour size mask and all except that the hand grasping the champagne bottle wore a white glove i assumed crossing to them over the thick rugs that that was a touch of bottweill elegance and didnt learn until later how wrong i was they gave me the seasons greetings and santa claus poured a glass of bubbles for me no gold leaf on the glass i was glad i had come to drink champagne with a blonde at one elbow and a brunette at the other gives a man a sense of wellbeing and those two were fine specimensthe tall slender margot relaxed all curves on the stool and little slanteyed blackeyed cherry quon who came only up to my collar when standing sitting with her spine as straight as a plumb line yet not stiff i thought cherry worthy of notice not only as a statuette though she was highly decorative but as a possible source of new light on human relations margot had told me that her father was half chinese and half indiannot american indianand her mother was dutch i said that apparently i had come too early but alfred kiernan said no the others were around and would be in shortly he added that it was a pleasant surprise to see me as it was just a little family gathering and he hadnt known others had been invited kiernan whose title was business manager had not liked a certain step i had taken when i was hunting the tapestries and he still didnt but an irishman at a christmas party likes everybody my impression was that he really was pleased so i was too margot said she had invited me and kiernan patted her on the arm and said that if she hadnt he would about my age and fully as handsome he was the kind who can pat the arm of a queen or a presidents wife without making eyebrows go up he said we needed another sample and turned to the bartender mr claus well try the veuve clicquot to us just like kurt to provide different brands no monotony for kurt to the bartender may i call you by your first name santy certainly sir santa claus told him from behind the mask in a thin falsetto that didnt match his size as he stooped and came up with a bottle a door at the left opened and two men entered one of them emil hatch i had met before when briefing wolfe on the tapestries and telling us about his staff bottweill had called margot dickey his contact woman cherry quon his handy girl and emil hatch his pet wizard and when i met hatch i found that he both looked the part and acted it he wasnt much taller than cherry quon and skinny and something had either pushed his left shoulder down or his right shoulder up making him lopsided and he had a sour face a sour voice and a sour taste when the stranger was named to me as leo jerome that placed him i was acquainted with his mother mrs perry porter jerome she was a widow and an angelthat is kurt bottweills angel during the investigation she had talked as if the tapestries belonged to her but that might have only been her manners of which she had plenty i could have made guesses about her personal relations with bottweill but hadnt bothered i have enough to do to handle my own personal relations without wasting my brain power on other peoples as for her son leo he must have got his physique from his fathertall bony bigeared and longarmed he was probably approaching thirty below kiernan but above margot and cherry when he shoved in between cherry and me giving me his back and emil hatch had something to tell kiernan sour no doubt i touched margots elbow and she slid off the stool and let herself be steered across to a divan which had been covered with designs by euclid in six or seven colours we stood looking down at it mighty pretty i said but nothing like as pretty as you if only that license were real i can get a real one for two dollars what do you say youshe said scornfully you wouldnt marry miss universe if she came on her knees with a billion dollars i dare her to try it did it work perfect simply perfect then youre ditching me yes archie darling but ill be a sister to you ive got a sister i want the license back for a souvenir and anyway i dont want it kicking around i could be hooked for forgery you can mail it to me once my own no i cant he tore it up the hell he did where are the pieces gone he put them in his wastebasket will you come to the wedding what wastebasket where the gold one by his desk in his office last evening after dinner will you come to the wedding i will not my heart is bleeding so will mr wolfesand by the way id better get out of here im not going to stand around and sulk you wont have to he wont know ive told you and anyway you wouldnt be expectedhere he comes she darted off to the bar and i headed that way through the door on the left appeared mrs perry porter jerome all of her plump and plushy with folds of mink trying to keep up as she breezed in as she approached those on stools left them and got onto their feet but that courtesy could have been as much for her companion as for her she was the angel but kurt bottweill was the boss he stopped five paces short of the bar extended his arms as far as they would go and sang out merry christmas all my blessings merry merry merry i still hadnt labelled him my first impression months ago had been that he was one of them but that had been wrong he was a man all right but the question was what kind about average in height round but not pudgy maybe fortytwo or three his fine black hair slicked back so that he looked balder than he was he was nothing great to look at but he had something not only for women but for men too wolfe had once invited him to stay for dinner and they had talked about the scrolls from the dead sea i had seen him twice at baseball games his label would have to wait as i joined them at the bar where santa claus was pouring mumms cordon rouge bottweill squinted at me a moment and then grinned goodwin you here good edith your pet sleuth mrs perry porter jerome reaching for a glass stopped her hand to look at me who asked you she demanded then went on with no room for a reply cherry i suppose cherry is a blessing leo quit tugging at me very well take it its warm in here she let her son pull her coat off then reached for a glass by the time leo got back from depositing the mink on the divan we all had glasses and when he had his we raised them and our eyes went to bottweill his eyes flashed around there are times he said when love takes over there are times wait a minute alfred kiernan cut in you enjoy it too you dont like this stuff i can stand a sip al but you wont enjoy it wait kiernan put his glass on the bar and marched to the door on the left and on out in five seconds he was back with a bottle in his hand and as he rejoined us and asked santa claus for a glass i saw the pernod label he pulled the cork which had been pulled before filled the glass halfway and held it out to bottweill there he said that will make it unanimous thanks al bottweill took it my secret public vice he raised the glass i repeat there are times when love takes over santa claus where is yours but i suppose you cant drink through that mask there are times when all the little demons disappear down their ratholes and ugliness itself takes on the shape of beauty when the darkest corner is touched by light when the coldest heart feels the glow of warmth when the trumpet call of good will and good cheer drowns out all the babel of mean little noises this is such a time merry christmas merry merry merry i was ready to touch glasses but both the angel and the boss steered theirs to their lips so i and the others followed suit i thought bottweills eloquence deserved more than a sip so i took a healthy gulp and from the corner of my eye i saw that he was doing likewise with the pernod as i lowered the glass my eyes went to mrs jerome as she spoke that was lovely she declared simply lovely i must write it down and have it printed that part about the trumpet callkurt what is it kurt he had dropped the glass and was clutching his throat with both hands as i moved he turned loose of his throat thrust his arms out and let out a yell i think he yelled merry but i wasnt really listening others started for him too but my reflexes were better trained for emergencies than any of theirs so i got him first as i got my arms around him he started choking and gurgling and a spasm went over him from head to foot that nearly loosened my grip they were making noises but no screams and someone was clawing at my arm as i was telling them to get back and give me room he was suddenly a dead weight and i almost went down with him and might have if kiernan hadnt grabbed his arm i called get a doctor and cherry ran to a table where there was a goldleaf phone kiernan and i let bottweill down on the rug he was out breathing fast and hard but as i was straightening his head his breathing slowed down and foam showed on his lips mrs jerome was commanding us do something do something there was nothing to do and i knew it while i was holding onto him i had got a whiff of his breath and now kneeling i leaned over to get my nose an inch from his and i knew that smell and it takes a big dose to hit that quick and hard kiernan was loosening bottweills tie and collar cherry quon called to us that she had tried a doctor and couldnt get him and was trying another margot was squatting at bottweills feet taking his shoes off and i could have told her she might as well let him die with his boots on but didnt i had two fingers on his wrist and my other hand inside his shirt and could feel him going when i could feel nothing i abandoned the chest and wrist took his hand which was a fist straightened the middle finger and pressed its nail with my thumbtip until it was white when i removed my thumb the nail stayed white dropping the hand i yanked a little cluster of fibres from the rug told kiernan not to move placed the fibres against bottweills nostrils fastened my eyes on them and held my breath for thirty seconds the fibres didnt move i stood up and spoke his heart has stopped and hes not breathing if a doctor came within three minutes and washed out his stomach with chemicals he wouldnt have with him there might be one chance in a thousand as it is cant you do something mrs jerome squawked not for him no im not an officer of the law but im a licensed detective and im supposed to know how to act in these circumstances and ill get it if i dont follow the rules of course do somethingmrs jerome squawked kiernans voice came from behind me hes dead i didnt turn to ask what test he had used of course i told them his drink was poisoned until the police come no one will touch anything especially the bottle of pernod and no one will leave this room you will i stopped dead then i demanded where is santa claus their heads turned to look at the bar no bartender on the chance that it had been too much for him i pushed between leo jerome and emil hatch to step to the end of the bar but he wasnt on the floor either i wheeled did anyone see him go they hadnt hatch said he didnt take the elevator im sure he didnt he must have he started off i blocked him you stay here ill take a look kiernan phone the police spring seventhreeonehundred i made for the door on the left and passed through pulling it shut as i went and was in bottweills office which i had seen before it was onefourth the size of the studio and much more subdued but was by no means squalid i crossed to the far end saw through the glass panel that bottweills private elevator wasnt there and pressed the button a clank and a whirr came from inside the shaft and it was coming when it was up and had jolted to a stop i opened the door and there on the floor was santa claus but only the outside of him he had moulted jacket breeches mask wig i didnt check to see if it was all there because i had another errand and not much time for it propping the elevator door open with a chair i went and circled around bottweills big goldleaf desk to his goldleaf wastebasket it was onethird full bending i started to paw decided that was inefficient picked it up and dumped it and began tossing things back in one by one some of the items were torn pieces of paper but none of them came from a marriage license when i had finished i stayed down a moment squatting wondering if i had hurried too much and possibly missed it and i might have gone through it again if i hadnt heard a faint noise from the studio that sounded like the elevator door opening i went to the door to the studio and opened it and as i crossed the sill two uniformed cops were deciding whether to give their first glance to the dead or the living iii three hours later we were seated more or less in a group and my old friend and foe sergeant purley stebbins of homicide stood surveying us his square jaw jutting and his big burly frame erect he spoke mr kiernan and mr hatch will be taken to the district attorneys office for further questioning the rest of you can go for the present but you will keep yourselves available at the addresses you have given before you go i want to ask you again here together about the man who was here as santa claus you have all claimed you know nothing about him do you still claim that it was twenty minutes to seven some two dozen city employeesmedical examiner photographer fingerprinters meatbasket bearers the whole kaboodlehad finished the onthescene routine including private interviews with the eyewitnesses i had made the highest score having had sessions with stebbins a precinct man and inspector cramer who had departed around five oclock to organise the hunt for santa claus im not objecting kiernan told stebbins to going to the district attorneys office im not objecting to anything but weve told you all we can i know i have it seems to me your job is to find him do you mean to say mrs jerome demanded that no one knows anything at all about him so they say purley told her no one even knew there was going to be a santa claus so they say he was brought to this room by bottweill about a quarter to three from his office the idea is that bottweill himself had arranged for him and he came up in the private elevator and put on the costume in bottweills office you may as well know there is some corroboration of that we have found out where the costume came fromburlesons on fortysixth street bottweill phoned them yesterday afternoon and ordered it sent here marked personal miss quon admits receiving the package and taking it to bottweill in his office for a cop you never just state a fact or report it or declare it or say it you admit it we are also purley admitted covering agencies which might have supplied a man to act santa claus but thats a big order if bottweill got a man through an agency theres no telling what he got if it was a man with a record when he saw trouble coming he beat it with everybodys attention on bottweill he sneaked out got his clothes whatever he had taken off in bottweills office and went down in the elevator he had come up in he shed the costume on the way down and after he was down and left it in the elevator if that was it if he was just a man bottweill hired he wouldnt have had any reason to kill himand besides he wouldnt have known that bottweills only drink was pernod and he wouldnt have known where the poison was also emil hatch said surer than ever if he was just hired for the job he was a damn fool to sneak out he might have known hed be found so he wasnt just hired he was someone who knew bottweill and knew about the pernod and the poison and had some good reason for wanting to kill him youre wasting your time on the agencies stebbins lifted his heavy broad shoulders and dropped them we waste most of our time mr hatch maybe he was too scared to think i just want you to understand that if we find him and thats how bottweill got him its going to be hard to believe that he put poison in that bottle but somebody did i want you to understand that so youll understand why you are all to be available at the addresses you have given dont make any mistake about that do you mean mrs jerome demanded that we are under suspicion that i and my son are under suspicion purley opened his mouth and shut it again with that kind he always had trouble with his impulses he wanted to say youre goddam right you are he did say i mean were going to find that santa claus and when we do well see if we cant see him for it well have to look further and well expect all of you to help us im taking it for granted youll all want to help dont you want to mrs jerome i would help if i could but i know nothing about it i only know that my very dear friend is dead and i dont intend to be abused and threatened what about the poison you know about it you have been questioned about it i know i have but what about it it must have been apparent from the questions the medical examiner thinks it was cyanide and expects the autopsy to verify it emil hatch uses potassium cyanide in his work with metals and plating and there is a large jar of it on a cupboard shelf in the workshop one floor below and there is a stair from bottweills office to the workroom anyone who knew that and who also knew that bottweill kept a case of pernod in a cabinet in his office and an open bottle of it in a drawer of his desk couldnt have asked for a better setup four of you have admitted knowing both of those things three of youmrs jerome leo jerome and archie goodwinadmit they knew about the pernod but deny they knew about the potassium cyanide that will thats not true she did know about it mrs perry porter jeromes hand shot out across her sons knees and slapped cherry quons cheek or mouth or both her son grabbed her arm alfred kiernan sprang to his feet and for a second i thought he was going to sock mrs jerome and he did too and possibly would have if margot dickey hadnt jerked at his coattail cherry put her hand to her face but except for that didnt move sit down stebbins told kiernan take it easy miss quon you say that mrs jerome knew about the potassium cyanide of course she did cherrys chirp was pitched lower than normal but it was still a chirp in the workshop one day i heard mr hatch telling her how he used it and how careful he had to be mr hatch do you verify nonsense mrs jerome snapped what if he did perhaps he did i had forgotten all about it i told you i wont tolerate this abuse purley eyed her look here mrs jerome when we find that santa claus if it was someone who knew bottweill and had a motive that may settle it if not it wont help anyone to talk about abuse and that includes you so far as i know now only one of you has told us a lie you thats on the record im telling you and all of you lies only make it harder for you but sometimes they make it easier for us ill leave it at that for now mr kiernan and mr hatch these menhe aimed a thumb over his shoulder at two dicks standing back of himwill take you downtown the rest of you can go but remember what i said goodwin i want to see you he had already seen me but i wouldnt make a point of it kiernan however had a point to make and made it he had to leave last so he could lock up it was so arranged the three women leo jerome and stebbins and i took the elevator down leaving the two dicks with kiernan and hatch down the sidewalk as they headed in different directions i could see no sign of tails taking after them it was still snowing a fine prospect for christmas and the street cleaners there were two police cars at the curb and purley went to one and opened the door and motioned to me to get in i objected if im invited downtown too im willing to oblige but im going to eat first i damn near starved to death there once youre not wanted downtown not right now get in out of the snow i did so and slid across under the wheel to make room for him he needs room he joined me and pulled the door shut if were going to sit here i suggested we might as well be rolling dont bother to cross town just drop me at thirtyfifth he objected i dont like to drive and talk or listen what were you doing there today ive told you having fun three kinds of champagne miss dickey invited me im giving you another chance you were the only outsider there why youre nothing special to miss dickey she was going to marry bottweill why ask her we have asked her she says there was no particular reason she knew bottweill liked you and theyve regarded you as one of them since you found some tapestries for them she stuttered around about it what i say any time i find you anywhere near a murder i want to know im giving you another chance so she hadnt mentioned the marriage license good for her i would rather have eaten all the snow that had fallen since noon than explain that damn license to sergeant stebbins or inspector cramer that was why i had gone through the wastebasket thanks for the chance i told him but i cant use it ive told you everything i saw and heard there today that put me in a class with mrs jerome since i had left out my little talk with margot ive told you all i know about those people lay off and go find your murderer i know you goodwin yeah youve even called me archie i treasure that memory i know you his head was turned on his bull neck and our eyes were meeting do you expect me to believe that guy got out of that room and away without you knowing it nuts i was kneeling on the floor watching a man die and they were around us anyway youre just talking to hear yourself you dont think i was accessory to the murder or to the murderers escape i didnt say i did even if he was wearing glovesand what for if not to leave no printsi dont say he was the murderer but if you knew who he was and didnt want him involved in it and let him get away and if you let us wear out our ankles looking for him what about that that would be bad if i asked my advice i would be against it goddamn it he barked do you know who he is no did you or wolfe have anything to do with getting him there no all right pile out theyll be wanting you downtown i hope not tonight im tired i opened the door you have my address i stepped out into the snow and he started the engine and rolled off it should have been a good hour for an empty taxi but in a christmasseason snowstorm it took me ten minutes to find one when it pulled up in front of the old brownstone on west thirtyfifth street it was eight minutes to eight as usual in my absence the chainbolt was on and i had to ring for fritz to let me in i asked him if wolfe was back and he said yes he was at dinner as i put my hat on the shelf and my coat on a hanger i asked if there was any left for me and he said plenty and moved aside for me to precede him down the hall to the door of the dining room fritz has fine manners wolfe in his oversized chair at the end of the table told me good evening not snapping or barking i returned it got seated at my place picked up my napkin and apologised for being late fritz came from the kitchen with a warm plate a platter of braised boned ducklings and a dish of potatoes baked with mushrooms and cheese i took enough wolfe asked if it was still snowing and i said yes after a good mouthful had been disposed of i spoke as you know i approve of your rule not to discuss business during a meal but ive got something on my chest and its not business its personal he grunted the death of mr bottweill was reported on the radio at seven oclock you were there yeah i was there i was kneeling by him while he died i replenished my mouth damn the radio i hadnt intended to mention the murder until i had dealt with the main issue from my standpoint when there was room enough for my tongue to work i went on ill report on that in full if you want it but i doubt if theres a job in it mrs perry porter jerome is the only suspect with enough jack to pay your fee and she has already notified purley stebbins that she wont be abused besides when they find santa claus that may settle it what i want to report on happened before bottweill died that marriage license i showed you is for the birds miss dickey has called it off i am out two bucks she told me she had decided to marry bottweill he was sopping a crust in the sauce on his plate indeed he said yes sir it was a jolt but i would have recovered in time then ten minutes later bottweill was dead where does that leave me sitting around up there through the routine i considered it perhaps i could get her back now but no thank you that license has been destroyed i get another one another two bucks and then she tells me she has decided to marry joe doakes im going to forget her im going to blot her out i resumed on the duckling wolfe was busy chewing when he could he said for me of course this is satisfactory i know it is do you want to hear about bottweill after dinner okay how did you make out with thompson but that didnt appeal to him as a dinner topic either in fact nothing did usually he likes table talk about anything from refrigerators to republicans but apparently the trip to long island and back with all its dangers had tired him out it suited me all right since i had had a noisy afternoon too and could stand a little silence when we had both done well with the duckling and potatoes and salad and baked pears and cheese and coffee he pushed back his chair theres a book he said that i want to look at its up in your roomhere and now by herbert block will you bring it down please though it meant climbing two flights with a full stomach i was glad to oblige out of appreciation for his calm acceptance of my announcement of my shattered hopes he could have been very vocal so i mounted the stairs cheerfully went to my room and crossed to the shelves where i keep a few books there were only a couple of dozen of them and i knew where each one was but here and now wasnt there where it should have been was a gap i looked around saw a book on the dresser and stepped to it it was here and now and lying on top of it was a pair of white cotton gloves i gawked iv i would like to say that i caught on immediately the second i spotted them but i didnt i had picked them up and looked them over and put one of them on and taken it off again before i fully realised that there was only one possible explanation having realised it instantly there was a traffic jam inside my skull horns blowing brakes squealing headon collisions to deal with it i went to a chair and sat it took me maybe a minute to reach my first clear conclusion he had taken this method of telling me he was santa claus instead of just telling me because he wanted me to think it over on my own before we talked it over together why did he want me to think it over on my own that took a little longer but with the traffic under control i found my way through to the only acceptable answer he had decided to give up his trip to see thompson and instead to arrange with bottweill to attend the christmas party disguised as santa claus because the idea of a woman living in his houseor of the only alternative my leavinghad made him absolutely desperate and he had to see for himself he had to see margot and me together and to talk with her if possible if he found out that the marriage license was a hoax he would have me by the tail he could tell me he would be delighted to welcome my bride and watch me wriggle out if he found that i really meant it he would know what he was up against and go on from there the point was this that he had shown what he really thought of me he had shown that rather than lose me he would do something that he wouldnt have done for any fee anybody could name he would rather have gone without beer for a week than admit it but now he was a fugitive from justice in a murder case and needed me so he had to let me know but he wanted it understood that that aspect of the matter was not to be mentioned the assumption would be that he had gone to bottweills instead of long island because he loved to dress up like santa claus and tend bar a cell in my brain tried to get the right of way for the question considering this development how big a raise should i get after new years but i waved it to the curb i thought over other aspects he had worn the gloves so i couldnt recognise his hands where did he get them what time had he got to bottweills and who had seen him did fritz know where he was going how had he got back home but after a little of that i realised that he hadnt sent me up to my room to ask myself questions he could answer so i went back to considering whether there was anything else he wanted me to think over alone deciding there wasnt after chewing it thoroughly i got here and now and the gloves from the dresser went to the stairs and descended and entered the office from behind his desk he glared at me as i crossed over here it is i said and handed him the book and much obliged for the gloves i held them up one in each hand dangling them from thumb and fingertip it is no occasion for clowning he growled it sure isnt i dropped the gloves on my desk whirled my chair and sat where do we start do you want to know what happened after you left the details can wait first where we stand was mr cramer there yes certainly did he get anywhere no he probably wont until he finds santa claus until they find santa claus they wont dig very hard at the others the longer it takes to find him the surer theyll be hes it three things about him nobody knows who he was he beat it and he wore gloves a thousand men are looking for him you were right to wear the gloves i would have recognised your hands but where did you get them at a store on ninth avenue confound it i didnt know a man was going to be murdered i know you didnt may i ask some questions he scowled i took it for yes when did you phone bottweill to arrange it at twothirty yesterday afternoon you had gone to the bank have you any reason to think he told anyone about it no he said he wouldnt i know he got the costume so thats okay when you left here today at twelvethirty did you go straight to bottweills no i left at that hour because you and fritz expected me to i stopped to buy the gloves and met him at rustermans and we had lunch from there we took a cab to his place arriving shortly after two oclock and took his private elevator up to his office immediately upon entering his office he got a bottle of pernod from a drawer of his desk said he always had a little after lunch and invited me to join him i declined he poured a liberal portion in a glass about two ounces drank it in two gulps and returned the bottle to the drawer my god i whistled the cops would like to know that no doubt the costume was there in a box there is a dressing room at the rear of his office with a bathroom i know ive used it i took the costume there and put it on he had ordered the largest size but it was a squeeze and it took a while i was in there half an hour or more when i reentered the office it was empty but soon bottweill came up the stairs from the workshop and helped me with the mask and wig they had barely been adjusted when emil hatch and mrs jerome and her son appeared also coming up the stairs from the workshop i left going to the studio and found miss quon and miss dickey and mr kiernan there and before long i was there then no one saw you unmasked when did you put the gloves on the last thing just before i entered the studio then you may have left prints i know you didnt know there was going to be a murder you left your clothes in the dressing room are you sure you got everything when you left yes i am not a complete ass i let that by why didnt you leave the gloves in the elevator with the costume because they hadnt come with it and i thought it better to take them that private elevator is at the rear of the hall downstairs did anyone see you leaving it or passing through the hall no the hall was empty how did you get home taxi no fritz didnt expect me until six or later i walked to the public library spent some two hours there and then took a cab i pursed my lips and shook my head to indicate sympathy that was his longest and hardest tramp since montenegro over a mile fighting his way through the blizzard in terror of the law on his tail but all the return i got for my look of sympathy was a scowl so i let loose i laughed i put my head back and let it come i had wanted to ever since i had learned he was santa claus but had been too busy thinking it was bottled up in me and i let it out good i was about to taper off to a cackle when he exploded confound it he bellowed marry and be damned that was dangerous that attitude could easily get us onto the aspect he had sent me up to my room to think over alone and if we got started on that anything could happen it called for tact i beg your pardon i said something caught in my throat do you want to describe the situation or do you want me to i would like to hear you try he said grimly yes sir i suspect that the only thing to do is to phone inspector cramer right now and invite him to come and have a chat and when he comes open the bag that will no i will not do that then next best i go to him and spill it there of course no he meant every word of it okay ill describe it theyll mark time on the others until they find santa claus theyve got to find him if he left any prints theyll compare them with every file theyve got and sooner or later theyll get to yours theyll cover all the stores for sales of white cotton gloves to men theyll trace bottweills movements and learn that he lunched with you at rustermans and you left together and theyll trace you to bottweills place of course your going there wont prove you were santa claus you might talk your way out of that and it will account for your prints if they find some but what about the gloves theyll trace that sale if you give them time and with a description of the buyer theyll find santa claus youre sunk i had never seen his face blacker if you sit tight till they find him i argued it will be quite a nuisance cramer has been itching for years to lock you up and any judge would commit you as a material witness who had run out whereas if you call cramer now and i mean now and invite him to come and have some beer while it will still be a nuisance it will be bearable of course hell want to know why you went there and played santa claus but you can tell him anything you please tell him you bet me a hundred bucks or what the hell make it a grand that you could be in a room with me for ten minutes and i wouldnt recognise you ill be glad to cooperate i leaned forward another thing if you wait till they find you you wont dare tell them that bottweill took a drink from that bottle shortly after two oclock and it didnt hurt him if you told about that after they dug you up they could book you for withholding evidence and they probably would and make it stick if you get cramer here now and tell him hell appreciate it though naturally he wont say so hes probably at his office shall i ring him no i will not confess that performance to mr cramer i will not unfold the morning paper to a disclosure of that outlandish masquerade then youre going to sit and read here and now until they come with a warrant no that would be fatuous he took in air through his mouth as far down as it would go and let it out through his nose im going to find the murderer and present him to mr cramer theres nothing else oh you are yes you might have said so and saved my breath instead of letting me spout i wanted to see if your appraisal of the situation agreed with mine it does thats fine then you also know that we may have two weeks and we may have two minutes at this very second some expert may be phoning homicide to say that he has found fingerprints that match on the card of wolfe nero the phone rang and i jerked around as if someone had stuck a needle in me maybe we wouldnt have even two minutes my hand wasnt trembling as i lifted the receiver i hope wolfe seldom lifts his until i have found out who it is but that time he did nero wolfes office archie goodwin speaking this is the district attorneys office mr goodwin regarding the murder of kurt bottweill we would like you to be here at ten oclock tomorrow morning all right sure at ten oclock sharp please ill be there we hung up wolfe sighed i sighed well i said ive already told them six times that i know absolutely nothing about santa claus so they may not ask me again if they do it will be interesting to compare my voice when im lying with when im telling the truth he grunted now i want a complete report of what happened there after i left but first i want background in your intimate association with miss dickey you must have learned things about those people what not much i cleared my throat i guess ill have to explain something my association with miss dickey was not intimate i stopped it wasnt easy choose your own adjective i meant no innuendo its not a question of adjectives miss dickey is a good dancer exceptionally good and for the past couple of months i have been taking her here and there some six or eight times altogether monday evening at the flamingo club she asked me to do her a favour she said bottweill was giving her a runaround that he had been going to marry her for a year but kept stalling and she wanted to do something she said cherry quon was making a play for him and she didnt intend to let cherry take the rail she asked me to get a marriagelicense blank and fill it out for her and me and give it to her she would show it to bottweill and tell him now or never it struck me as a good deed with no risk involved and as i say she is a good dancer tuesday afternoon i got a blank no matter how and that evening up in my room i filled it in including a fancy signature wolfe made a noise thats all i said except that i want to make it clear that i had no intention of showing it to you i did that on the spur of the moment when you picked up your book your memory is as good as mine also to close it up no doubt you noticed that today just before bottweill and mrs jerome joined the party margot and i stepped aside for a little chat she told me the license did the trick her words were perfect simply perfect she said that last evening in his office he tore the license up and put the pieces in his wastebasket thats okay the cops didnt find them i looked before they came and the pieces werent there his mouth was working but he didnt open it he didnt dare he would have liked to tear into me to tell me that my insufferable flummery had got him into this awful mess but if he did so he would be dragging in the aspect he didnt want mentioned he saw that in time and saw that i saw it his mouth worked but that was all finally he spoke then you are not on intimate terms with miss dickey no sir even so she must have spoken of that establishment and those people some yes and one of them killed bottweill the poison was put in the bottle between twoten when i saw him take a drink and threethirty when kiernan went and got the bottle no one came up in the private elevator during the halfhour or more i was in the dressing room i was getting into that costume and gave no heed to footsteps or other sounds in the office but the elevator shaft adjoins the dressing room and i would have heard it it is a strong probability that the opportunity was even narrower that the poison was put in the bottle while i was in the dressing room since three of them were in the office with bottweill when i left it must be assumed that one of those three or one of the three in the studio had grasped an earlier opportunity what about them not much mostly from monday evening when margot was talking about bottweill so its all hearsay from her mrs jerome has put half a million in the businessprobably you should divide that by two at leastand thinks she owns him or thought she was jealous of margot and cherry as for leo if his mother was dishing out the dough he expected to inherit to a guy who was trying to corner the worlds supply of gold leaf and possibly might also marry him and if he knew about the jar of poison in the workshop he might have been tempted kiernan i dont know but from a remark margot made and from the way he looked at cherry this afternoon i suspect he would like to mix some irish with her chinese and indian and dutch and if he thought bottweill had him stymied he might have been tempted too so much for hearsay mr hatch nothing on him from margot but dealing with him during the tapestry job i wouldnt have been surprised if he had wiped out the whole bunch on general principles his heart pumps acid instead of blood hes a creative artist he told me so he practically told me that he was responsible for the success of that enterprise but got no credit he didnt tell me that he regarded bottweill as a phoney and a fourflusher but he did you may remember that i told you he had a persecution complex and you told me to stop using other peoples jargon thats four of them miss dickey i raised my brows i got her a license to marry not to kill if she was lying when she said it worked shes almost as good a liar as she is a dancer maybe she is if it didnt work she might have been tempted too and miss quon shes half oriental im not up on orientals but i understand they slant their eyes to keep you guessing thats what makes them inscrutable if i had to be poisoned by one of that bunch i would want it to be her except for what margot told me the doorbell rang that was worse than the phone if they had hit on santa clauss trail and it led to nero wolfe cramer was much more apt to come than to call wolfe and i exchanged glances looking at my wristwatch and seeing i arose went to the hall and flipped the switch for the stoop light and took a look through the oneway glass panel of the front door i have good eyes but the figure was muffled in a heavy coat with a hood so i stepped halfway to the door to make sure then i returned to the office and told wolfe cherry quon alone he frowned i wanted he cut it off very well bring her in v as i have said cherry was highly decorative and she went fine with the red leather chair at the end of wolfes desk it would have held three of her she had let me take her coat in the hall and still had on the neat little woollen number she had worn at the party it wasnt exactly yellow but there was yellow in it i would have called it offgold and it and the red chair and the tea tint of her smooth little carved face would have made a very nice kodachrome she sat on the edge her spine straight and her hands together in her lap i was afraid to telephone she said because you might tell me not to come so i just came will you forgive me wolfe grunted no commitment she smiled at him a friendly smile or so i thought after all she was half oriental i must get myself together she chirped im nervous because its so exciting to be here she turned her head theres the globe and the bookshelves and the safe and the couch and of course archie goodwin and you you behind your desk in your enormous chair oh i know this place i have read about you so mucheverything there is i think its exciting to be here actually here in this chair and see you of course i saw you this afternoon but that wasnt the same thing you could have been anybody in that silly santa claus costume i wanted to pull your whiskers she laughed a friendly little tinkle like a bell i think i looked bewildered that was my idea after it had got through my ears to the switchboard inside and been routed i was too busy handling my face to look at wolfe but he was probably even busier since she was looking straight at him i moved my eyes to him when he spoke if i understand you miss quon im at a loss if you think you saw me this afternoon in a santa claus costume youre mistaken oh im sorry she exclaimed then you havent told them my dear madam his voice sharpened if you must talk in riddles talk to mr goodwin he enjoys them but i am sorry mr wolfe i should have explained first how i know this morning at breakfast kurt told me you had phoned him and arranged to appear at the party as santa claus and this afternoon i asked him if you had come and he said you had and you were putting on the costume thats how i know but you havent told the police then its a good thing i havent told them either isnt it this is interesting wolfe said coldly what do you expect to accomplish by this fantastic folderol she shook her pretty little head you with so much sense you must see that its no use if i tell them even if they dont like to believe me they will investigate i know they cant investigate as well as you can but surely they will find something he shut his eyes tightened his lips and leaned back in his chair i kept mine opened on her she weighed about a hundred and two i could carry her under one arm with my other hand clamped on her mouth putting her in the spare room upstairs wouldnt do since she could open a window and scream but there was a cubbyhole in the basement next to fritzs room with an old couch in it or as an alternative i could get a gun from my desk drawer and shoot her probably no one knew she had come here wolfe opened his eyes and straightened up very well it is still fantastic but i concede that you could create an unpleasant situation by taking that yarn to the police i dont suppose you came here merely to tell me that you intend to what do you intend i think we understand each other she chirped i understand only that you want something what you are so direct she complained so very abrupt that i must have said something wrong but i do want something you see since the police think it was the man who acted santa claus and ran away they may not get on the right track until its too late you wouldnt want that would you no reply i wouldnt want it she said and her hands on her lap curled into little fists i wouldnt want whoever killed kurt to get away no matter who it was but you see i know who killed him i have told the police but they wont listen until they find santa claus or if they listen they think im just a jealous cat and besides im an oriental and their ideas of orientals are very primitive i was going to make them listen by telling them who santa claus was but i know how they feel about you from what ive read and i was afraid they would try to prove it was you who killed kurt and of course it could have been you and you did run away and they still wouldnt listen to me when i told them who did kill him she stopped for breath wolfe inquired who did she nodded ill tell you margot dickey and kurt were having an affair a few months ago kurt began on me and it was hard for me because ii she frowned for a word and found one i had a feeling for him i had a strong feeling but you see i am a virgin and i wouldnt give in to him i dont know what i would have done if i hadnt known he was having an affair with margot but i did know and i told him the first man i slept with would be my husband he said he was willing to give up margot but even if he did he couldnt marry me on account of mrs jerome because she would stop backing him with her money i dont know what he was to mrs jerome but i know what she was to him her hands opened and closed again to be fists that went on and on but kurt had a feeling for me too last night late it was after midnight he phoned me that he had broken with margot for good and he wanted to marry me he wanted to come and see me but i told him i was in bed and we would see each other in the morning he said that would be at the studio with other people there so finally i said i would go to his apartment for breakfast and i did this morning but i am still a virgin mr wolfe he was focused on her with halfclosed eyes that is your privilege madam oh she said is it a privilege it was there at breakfast that he told me about you your arranging to be santa claus when i got to the studio i was surprised to see margot there and how friendly she was that was part of her plan to be friendly and cheerful with everyone she has told the police that kurt was going to marry her that they decided last night to get married next week christmas week i am a christian wolfe stirred in his chair have we reached the point did miss dickey kill mr bottweill yes of course she did have you told the police that yes i didnt tell them all i have told you but enough with evidence no i have no evidence then youre vulnerable to an action for slander she opened her fists and turned her palms up does that matter when i know im right when i know it but she was so clever the way she did it that there cant be any evidence everybody there today knew about the poison and they all had a chance to put it in the bottle they can never prove she did it they cant even prove she is lying when she says kurt was going to marry her because he is dead she acted today the way she would have acted if that had been true but it has got to be proved somehow there has got to be evidence to prove it and you want me to get it she let that pass what i was thinking mr wolfe you are vulnerable too there will always be the danger that the police will find out who santa claus was and if they find it was you and you didnt tell them i havent conceded that wolfe snapped then well just say there will always be the danger that ill tell them what kurt told me and you did concede that that would be unpleasant so it would be better if the evidence proved who killed kurt and also proved who santa claus was wouldnt it go on so i thought how easy it would be for you to get the evidence you have men who do things for you who would do anything for you and one of them can say that you asked him to go there and be santa claus and he did of course it couldnt be mr goodwin since he was at the party and it would have to be a man they couldnt prove was somewhere else he can say that while he was in the dressing room putting on the costume he heard someone in the office and peeked out to see who it was and he saw margot dickey get the bottle from the desk drawer and put something in it and put the bottle back in the drawer and go out that must have been when she did it because kurt always took a drink of pernod when he came back from lunch wolfe was rubbing his lip with a fingertip i see he muttered she wasnt through he can say she went on that he ran away because he was frightened and wanted to tell you about it first i dont think they would do anything to him if he went to them tomorrow morning and told them all about it would they just like me i dont think they would do anything to me if i went to them tomorrow morning and told them i had remembered that kurt told me that you were going to be santa claus and this afternoon he told me you were in the dressing room putting on the costume that would be the same kind of thing wouldnt it her little carved mouth thinned and widened with a smile thats what i want she chirped did i say it so you understand it you did indeed wolfe assured her you put it admirably would it be better instead of him going to tell them for you to have inspector cramer come here and you tell him you could have the man here you see i know how you do things from all i have read that might be better he allowed his tone was dry but not hostile i could see a muscle twitching beneath his right ear but she couldnt i suppose miss quon it is futile to advance the possibility that one of the others killed him and if so it would be a pity excuse me i interrupt the chirp was still a chirp but it had hard steel in it i know she killed him i dont and even if i bow to your conviction before i could undertake the stratagem you propose i would have to make sure there are no facts that would scuttle it it wont take me long youll hear from me tomorrow ill want she interrupted again i cant wait longer than tomorrow morning to tell them what kurt told me pfui you can and will the moment you disclose that you no longer have a whip to dangle at me you will hear from me tomorrow now i want to think archie i left my chair she looked up at me and back at wolfe for some seconds she sat considering inscrutable of course then stood up it was very exciting to be here she said the steel gone to see you here you must forgive me for not phoning i hope it will be early tomorrow she turned and headed for the door and i followed after i had helped her on with her hooded coat and let her out and watched her picking her way down the seven steps i shut the door put the chainbolt on returned to the office and told wolfe it has stopped snowing who do you think will be best for it saul or fred or orrie or bill sit down he growled you see through women well not that one i pass i wouldnt bet a dime on her one way or the other would you no she is probably a liar and possibly a murderer sit down i must have everything that happened there today after i left every word and gesture i sat and gave it to him including the question period it took an hour and thirtyfive minutes it was after one oclock when he pushed his chair back levered his bulk upright told me good night and went up to bed vi at half past two the following afternoon saturday i sat in a room in a building on leonard street the room where i had once swiped an assistant district attorneys lunch there would be no need for me to repeat the performance since i had just come back from osts restaurant where i had put away a plateful of pigs knuckles and sauerkraut as far as i knew there had not only been no steps to frame margot for murder there had been no steps at all since wolfe is up in the plant rooms every morning from nine to eleven and since he breakfasts from a tray up in his room and since i was expected downtown at ten oclock i had buzzed him on the house phone a little before nine to ask for instructions and had been told that he had none downtown assistant da farrell after letting me wait in the anteroom for an hour had spent two hours with me together with a stenographer and a dick who had been on the scene friday afternoon going back and forth and zigzag not only over what i had already reported but also over my previous association with the bottweill personnel he only asked me once if i knew anything about santa claus so i only had to lie once if you dont count my omitting any mention of the marriage license when he called a recess and told me to come back at twothirty on my way to osts for the pigs knuckles i phoned wolfe to tell him i didnt know when i would be home and again he had no instructions i said i doubted if cherry quon would wait until after new years to spill the beans and he said he did too and hung up when i was ushered back into farrells office at twothirty he was aloneno stenographer and no dick he asked me if i had had a good lunch and even waited for me to answer handed me some typewritten sheets and leaned back in his chair read it over he said and see if you want to sign it his tone seemed to imply that i might not so i went over it carefully five full pages finding no editorial revisions to object to i pulled my chair forward to a corner of his desk put the statement on the desk top and got my pen from my pocket wait a minute farrell said youre not a bad guy even if you are cocky and why not give you a break that says specifically that you have reported everything you did there yesterday afternoon yeah ive read it so so who put your fingerprints on some of the pieces of paper in bottweills wastebasket ill be damned i said i forgot to put gloves on all right youre cocky i already know that his eyes were pinning me you must have gone through that wastebasket every item when you went to bottweills office ostensibly to look for santa claus and you hadnt just forgotten it you dont forget things so you have deliberately left it out i want to know why and i want to know what you took from that wastebasket and what you did with it i grinned at him i am also damned because i thought i knew how thorough they are and apparently i didnt i wouldnt have supposed they went so far as to dust the contents of a wastebasket when there was nothing to connect them but i see i was wrong and i hate to be wrong i shrugged well we learn something new every day i screwed the statement around to position signed it at the bottom of the last page slid it across to him and folded the carbon copy and put it in my pocket ill write it in if you insist i told him but i doubt if its worth the trouble santa claus had run kiernan was calling the police and i guess i was a little rattled i must have looked around for something that might give me a line on santa claus and my eye lit on the wastebasket and i went through it i havent mentioned it because it wasnt very bright and i like people to think im bright especially cops theres your why as for what i took the answer is nothing i dumped the wastebasket put everything back in and took nothing do you want me to write that in no i want to discuss it i know you are bright and you werent rattled you dont rattle i want to know the real reason you went through the wastebasket what you were after whether you got it and what you did with it it cost me more than an hour twenty minutes of which were spent in the office of the district attorney himself with farrell and another assistant present at one point it looked as if they were going to hold me as a material witness but that takes a warrant the christmas weekend had started and there was nothing to show that i had monkeyed with anything that could be evidence so finally they shooed me out after i had handwritten an insert in my statement it was too bad keeping such important public servants sitting there while i copied the insert on my carbon but i like to do things right by the time i got home it was ten minutes past four and of course wolfe wasnt in the office since his afternoon session up in the plant rooms is from four to six there was no note on my desk from him so apparently there were still no instructions but there was information on it my desk ashtray which is mostly for decoration since i seldom smokea gift not to wolfe but to me from a former clientis a jade bowl six inches across it was there in its place and in it were stubs from pharaoh cigarettes saul panzer smokes pharaohs egyptians i suppose a few other people do too but the chance that one of them had been sitting at my desk while i was gone was too slim to bother with and not only had saul been there but wolfe wanted me to know it since one of the eight million things he will not tolerate in the office is ashtrays with remains he will actually walk clear to the bathroom himself to empty one so steps were being taken after all what steps saul a free lance and the best operative anywhere around asks and gets sixty bucks a day and is worth twice that wolfe had not called him in for any routine errand and of course the idea that he had undertaken to sell him on doubling for santa claus never entered my head framing someone for murder even a woman who might be guilty was not in his bag of tricks i got at the house phone and buzzed the plant rooms and after a wait had wolfes voice in my ear yes fritz not fritz me im back nothing urgent to report they found my prints on stuff in the wastebasket but i escaped without loss of blood is it all right for me to empty my ashtray yes please do so then what do i do ill tell you at six oclock possibly earlier he hung up i went to the safe and looked in the cash drawer to see if saul had been supplied with generous funds but the cash was as i had last seen it and there was no entry in the book i emptied the ashtray i went to the kitchen where i found fritz pouring a mixture into a bowl of pork tenderloin and said i hoped saul had enjoyed his lunch and fritz said he hadnt stayed for lunch so steps must have been begun right after i left in the morning i went back to the office read over the carbon copy of my statement before filing it and passed the time by thinking up eight different steps that saul might have been assigned but none of them struck me as promising a little after five the phone rang and i answered it was saul he said he was glad to know i was back home safe and i said i was too just a message for mr wolfe he said tell him everything is set no snags thats all right ill be seeing you i cradled the receiver sat a moment to consider whether to go up to the plant rooms or use the house phone decided the latter would do and pulled it to me and pushed the button when wolfes voice came it was peevish he hates to be disturbed up there yes saul called and said to tell you everything is set no snags congratulations am i in the way oddly enough no have chairs in place for visitors ten should be enough four or five will come shortly after six oclock i hope not more others will come later refreshments liquids of course nothing else anything else for me no he was gone before going to the front room for chairs and to the kitchen for supplies i took time out to ask myself whether i had the slightest notion what kind of charade he was cooking up this time i hadnt vii it was four they all arrived between sixfifteen and sixtwentyfirst mrs perry porter jerome and her son leo then cherry quon and last emil hatch mrs jerome copped the red leather chair but i moved her mink and all to one of the yellow ones when cherry came i was willing to concede that cherry might be headed for a very different kind of chair wired for power but even so i thought she rated that background and mrs jerome didnt by sixthirty when i left them to cross the hall to the dining room not a word had passed among them in the dining room wolfe had just finished a bottle of beer okay i told him its sixthirtyone only four kiernan and margot dickey havent shown satisfactory he arose have they demanded information two of them have hatch and mrs jerome i told them it will come from you as instructed that was easy since i have none he headed for the office and i followed though they didnt know except cherry that he had poured champagne for them the day before introductions werent necessary because they had all met him during the tapestry hunt after circling around cherry in the red leather chair he stood behind his desk to ask them how they did then sat i dont thank you for coming he said because you came in your own interest not mine i sent i came hatch cut in sourer than ever to find out what youre up to you will wolfe assured him i sent each of you an identical message saying that mr goodwin has certain information which he feels he must give the police not later than tonight but i have persuaded him to let me discuss it with you first before i i didnt know others would be here mrs jerome blurted glaring at cherry neither did i hatch said glaring at mrs jerome wolfe ignored it the message i sent miss quon was somewhat different but that need not concern you before i tell you what mr goodwins information is i need a few facts from you for instance i understand that any of youincluding miss dickey and mr kiernan who will probably join us latercould have found an opportunity to put the poison in the bottle do any of you challenge that cherry mrs jerome and leo all spoke at once hatch merely looked sour wolfe showed them a palm if you please i point no finger of accusation at any of you i merely say that none of you including miss dickey and mr kiernan can prove that you had no opportunity can you nuts leo jerome was disgusted it was that guy playing santa claus of course it was i was with bottweill and my mother all the time first in the workshop and then in his office i can prove that but bottweill is dead wolfe reminded him and your mother is your mother did you go up to the office a little before them or did your mother go up a little before you and bottweill did is there acceptable proof that you didnt the others have the same problem miss quon there was no danger of cherrys spoiling it wolfe had told me what he had told her on the phone that he had made a plan which he thought she would find satisfactory and if she came at a quarter past six she would see it work she had kept her eyes fixed on him ever since he entered now she chirped if you mean i cant prove i wasnt in the office alone yesterday no i cant mr hatch i didnt come here to prove anything i told you what i came for what information has goodwin got well get to that a few more facts first mrs jerome when did you learn that bottweill had decided to marry miss quon leo shouted no but his mother was too busy staring at wolfe to hear him what she croaked then she found her voice kurt marry her that little strumpet cherry didnt move a muscle her eyes still on wolfe this is wonderful leo said this is marvellous not so damn wonderful emil hatch declared i get the idea wolfe goodwin hasnt got any information and neither have you why you wanted to get us together and start us clawing at each other i dont see that i dont know why youre interested but maybe ill find out if i give you a hand this crowd has produced as fine a collection of venom as you could find maybe we all put poison in the bottle and thats why it was such a big dose if its true that kurt had decided to marry cherry and al kiernan knew it that would have done it al would have killed a hundred kurts if it would get him cherry if mrs jerome knew it i would think she would have gone for cherry instead of kurt but maybe she figured there would soon be another one and she might as well settle it for good as for leo i think he rather liked kurt but what can you expect kurt was milking mamma of the pile leo hoped to get some day and i suspect that the pile is not all its supposed to be actually he stopped and i left my chair leo was on his way up obviously with the intention of plugging the creative artist i moved to head him off and at the same instant i gave him a shove and his mother jerked at his coattail that not only halted him but nearly upset him and with my other hand i steered him back onto his chair and then stood beside him hatch inquired shall i go on by all means wolfe said actually though cherry would seem to be the most likely she has the best brain of the lot and by far the strongest will but i understand that while she says kurt was going to marry her margot claims that he was going to marry her of course that complicates it and anyway margot would be my second choice margot has more than her share of the kind of pride that is only skin deep and therefore cant stand a scratch if kurt did decide to marry cherry and told margot so he was even a bigger imbecile than i thought he was which brings us to me i am in a class by myself i despise all of them if i had decided to take to poison i would have put it in the champagne as well as the pernod and i would have drunk vodka which i preferand by the way on that table is a bottle with the korbeloff vodka label i havent had a taste of korbeloff for fifteen years is it real it is archie serving liquid refreshments to a group of invited guests can be a pleasant chore but it wasnt that time when i asked mrs jerome to name it she only glowered at me but by the time i had filled cherrys order for scotch and soda and supplied hatch with a liberal dose of korbeloff no dilution and leo had said he would take bourbon and water his mother muttered that she would have that too as i was pouring the bourbon i wondered where we would go from there it looked as if the time had come for wolfe to pass on the information which i felt i must give the police without delay which made it difficult because i didnt have any that had been fine for a bait to get them there but what now i suppose wolfe would have held them somehow but he didnt have to he had rung for beer and fritz had brought it and was putting the tray on his desk when the doorbell rang i handed leo his bourbon and water and went to the hall out on the stoop with his big round face nearly touching the glass was inspector cramer of homicide wolfe had told me enough before the company came to give me a general idea of the program so the sight of cramer just cramer was a letdown but as i went down the hall other figures appeared none of them strangers and that looked better in fact it looked fine i swung the door wide and in they camecramer then saul panzer then margot dickey then alfred kiernan and bringing up the rear sergeant purley stebbins by the time i had the door closed and bolted they had their coats off including cramer and it was also fine to see that he expected to stay a while ordinarily once in he marches down the hall and into the office without ceremony but that time he waved the others ahead including me and he and stebbins came last herding us in crossing the sill i stepped aside for the pleasure of seeing his face when his eyes lit on those already there and the empty chairs waiting undoubtedly he had expected to find wolfe alone reading a book he came in two paces glared around fastened the glare on wolfe and barked whats all this i was expecting you wolfe said politely miss quon if you dont mind moving mr cramer likes that chair good evening miss dickey mr kiernan mr stebbins if you will all be seated panzer cramer barked saul who had started for a chair in the rear stopped and turned im running this cramer declared panzer youre under arrest and youll stay with stebbins and keep your mouth shut i dont want no wolfe said sharply if hes under arrest take him out of here you are not running this not in my house if you have warrants for anyone present or have taken them by lawful police power take them and leave these premises would you bulldoze me mr cramer you should know better that was the point cramer did know him there was the stage all set there were mrs jerome and leo and cherry and emil hatch and the empty chairs and above all there was the fact that he had been expected he wouldnt have taken wolfes word for that he wouldnt have taken wolfes word for anything but whenever he appeared on our stoop not expected i always left the chainbolt on until he had stated his business and i had reported to wolfe and if he had been expected there was no telling what wolfe had ready to spring so cramer gave up the bark and merely growled i want to talk with you certainly wolfe indicated the red leather chair which cherry had vacated be seated not here alone wolfe shook his head it would be a waste of time this way is better and quicker you know quite well sir it was a mistake to barge in here and roar at me that you are running my house either go with whomever you can lawfully take or sit down while i tell you who killed kurt bottweill wolfe wiggled a finger your chair cramers round red face had been redder than normal from the outside cold and now was redder still he glanced around compressed his lips until he didnt have any and went to the red leather chair and sat viii wolfe sent his eyes around as i circled to my desk saul had got to a chair in the rear after all but stebbins had too and was at his elbow margot had passed in front of the jeromes and emil hatch to get to the chair at the end nearest me and cherry and al kiernan were at the other end a little back of the others hatch had finished his korbeloff and put the glass on the floor but cherry and the jeromes were hanging on to their tall ones wolfes eyes came to rest on cramer and he spoke i must confess that i stretched it a little i cant tell you at the moment who killed bottweill i have only a supposition but soon i can and will first some facts for you i assume you know that for the past two months mr goodwin has been seeing something of miss dickey he says she dances well yeah cramers voice came over sandpaper of the roughest grit you can save that for later i want to know if you sent panzer to meet wolfe cut him off you will im headed for that but you may prefer this firsthand archie if you please what miss dickey asked you to do last monday evening and what happened i cleared my throat we were dancing at the flamingo club she said bottweill had been telling her for a year that he would marry her next week but next week never came and she was going to have a showdown with him she asked me to get a blank marriage license and fill it out for her and me and give it to her and she would show it to bottweill and tell him now or never i got the blank on tuesday and filled it in and wednesday i gave it to her i stopped wolfe prompted me and yesterday afternoon she told me that the license trick had worked perfectly that was about a minute before bottweill entered the studio i said in my statement to the district attorney that she told me bottweill was going to marry her but i didnt mention the license it was immaterial did she tell you what happened to the license so we were emptying the bag i nodded she said bottweill had torn it up and put the pieces in the wastebasket by the desk in his office the night before thursday evening and what did you do when you went to the office after bottweill had died i dumped the wastebasket and put the stuff back in it piece by piece no part of the license was there you made sure of that yes wolfe left me and asked cramer any questions no he lied in his statement ill attend to that later what i want margot dickey blurted then cherry took it she craned her neck to see across the others you took it you slut i did not the steel was in cherrys chirp again her eyes didnt leave wolfe and she told him im not going to wait any longer miss quon he snapped im doing this he returned to cramer now another fact yesterday i had a luncheon appointment with mr bottweill at rustermans restaurant he had once dined at my table and wished to reciprocate shortly before i left to keep the appointment he phoned to ask me to do him a favour he said he was extremely busy and might be a few minutes late and he needed a pair of white cotton gloves medium size for a man and would i stop at some shop on the way and get them it struck me as a peculiar request but he was a peculiar man since mr goodwin had chores to do and i will not ride in taxicabs if there is any alternative i had engaged a car at baxters and the chauffeur recommended a shop on eighth avenue between thirtyninth and fortieth streets we stopped there and i bought the gloves cramers eyes were such narrow slits that none of the bluegray showed he wasnt buying any part of it which was unjustified since some of it was true wolfe went on at the lunch table i gave the gloves to mr bottweill and he explained somewhat vaguely what he wanted them for i gathered that he had taken pity on some vagabond he had seen on a park bench and had hired him to serve refreshments at his office party costumed as santa claus and he had decided that the only way to make his hands presentable was to have him wear gloves you shake your head mr cramer youre damn right i do you would have reported that no reason on earth not to go ahead and finish ill finish this first i didnt report it because i thought you would find the murderer without it it was practically certain that the vagabond had merely skeddaddled out of fright since he couldnt possibly have known of the jar of poison in the workshop not to mention other considerations and as you know i have a strong aversion to involvement in matters where i have no concern or interest you can of course check thiswith the staff at rustermans my presence there with mr bottweill and with the chauffeur my conferring with him about the gloves and our stopping at the shop to buy them youre reporting it now i am indeed wolfe was unruffled because i understood from mr goodwin that you were extending and intensifying your search for the man who was there as santa claus and with your army and your resources it probably wouldnt take you long when the holiday had ended to learn where the gloves were bought and get a description of the man who bought them my physique is not unique but it isuncommon and the only question was how long it would take you to get to me and then i would be under inquisition obviously i had to report the episode to you and suffer your rebuke for not reporting it earlier but i wanted to make it as tolerable as possible i had one big advantage i knew that the man who acted as santa claus was almost certainly not the murderer and i decided to use it i needed first to have a talk with one of those people and i did so with miss quon who came here last evening why miss quon wolfe turned a hand over when i have finished you can decide whether such details are important with her i discussed her associates at that place and their relationships and i became satisfied that bottweill had in fact decided to marry her that was all you can also decide later whether it is worth while to ask her to corroborate that and i have no doubt she will he was looking at cherry of course for any sign of danger she had started to blurt it out once and might again but meeting his gaze she didnt move a muscle wolfe returned to cramer this morning i acted mr goodwin was absent at the district attorneys office so i called in mr panzer after spending an hour with me here he went to do some errands the first one was to learn whether bottweills wastebasket had been emptied since his conversation with miss dickey in his office thursday evening as you know mr panzer is highly competent through miss quon he got the name and address of the cleaning woman found her and talked with her and was told that the wastebasket had been emptied at about six oclock thursday afternoon and not since then meanwhile i cherry took itthe pieces margot said wolfe ignored her meanwhile i was phoning everyone concernedmrs jerome and her son miss dickey miss quon mr hatch and mr kiernanand inviting them to come here for a conference at sixfifteen i told them that mr goodwin had information which he intended to give the police which was not true and that i thought it best to discuss it first with them i told you so hatch muttered wolfe ignored him too mr panzers second errand or series of errands was the delivery of some messages he had written them in longhand at my dictation here this morning on plain sheets of paper and had addressed plain envelopes they were identical and ran as follows when i was there yesterday putting on my costume i saw you through a crack in the door and i saw what you did do you want me to tell the cops be at grand central information booth upper level at today ill come up to you and say saint nick by god cramer said you admit it wolfe nodded i proclaim it the messages were signed santa claus mr panzer accompanied the messenger who took them to the persons i have named and made sure they were delivered they were not so much shots at random as they may appear if one of those people had killed bottweill it was likely that the poison had been put in the bottle while the vagabond was donning the santa claus costume miss quon had told me as no doubt she has told you that bottweill invariably took a drink of pernod when he returned from lunch and since the appearance of santa claus at the party had been a surprise to all of them and none of them knew who he was it was highly probable that the murderer would believe he had been observed and would be irresistibly impelled to meet the writer of the message so it was a reasonable assumption that one of the shots would reach its target the question was which one wolfe stopped to pour beer he did pour it but i suspected that what he really stopped for was to offer an opening for comment or protest no one had any not even cramer they all just sat and gazed at him i was thinking that he had neatly skipped one detail that the message from santa claus had not gone to cherry quon she knew too much about him wolfe put the bottle down and turned to go on to cramer there was the possibility of course that more than one of them would go to you with the message but even if you decided because it had been sent to more than one that it was some hoax you would want to know who perpetrated it and you would send one of them to the rendezvous under surveillance any one or more excepting the murderer might go to you or none might and surely only the murderer would go to the rendezvous without first consulting you so if one of those six people were guilty and if it had been possible for santa claus to observe him disclosure seemed next to certain saul you may now report what happened you were in the vicinity of the information booth shortly before sixthirty necks were twisted for a view of saul panzer he nodded yes sir at sixtwenty within three minutes i had recognised three homicide men scattered around in different spots i dont know if they recognised me or not at six twentyeight i saw alfred kiernan walk up near the booth and stand there about ten feet away from it i was just about to go and speak to him when i saw margot dickey coming up from the fortysecond street side she approached to within thirty feet of the booth and stood looking around following your instructions in case more than one of them appeared and miss dickey was one of them i went to her and said saint nick she said who are you and what do you want i said excuse me ill be right back and went over to alfred kiernan and said to him saint nick as soon as i said that he raised a hand to his ear and then here they came the three i had recognised and two more and then inspector cramer and sergeant stebbins i was afraid miss dickey would run and she did start to but they had seen me speak to her and two of them stopped her and had her saul halted because of an interruption purley stebbins seated next to him got up and stepped over to margot dickey and stood there behind her chair to me it seemed unnecessary since i was sitting not much more than arms length from her and might have been trusted to grab her if she tried to start anything but purley is never very considerate of other peoples feelings especially mine saul resumed naturally it was miss dickey i was interested in since they had moved in on a signal from kiernan but they had her so that was okay they took us to a room back of the parcel room and started in on me and i followed your instructions i told them i would answer no questions would say nothing whatever except in the presence of nero wolfe because i was acting under your orders when they saw i meant it they took us out to two police cars and brought us here anything else no wolfe told him satisfactory he turned to cramer i assume mr panzer is correct in concluding that mr kiernan gave your men a signal so mr kiernan had gone to you with the message yes cramer had taken a cigar from his pocket and was squeezing it in his hand he does that sometimes when he would like to squeeze wolfes throat instead so had three of the othersmrs jerome her son and hatch but miss dickey hadnt no neither had miss quon miss quon was probably reluctant understandably she told me last evening that the polices ideas of orientals are very primitive as for miss dickey i may say that i am not surprised for a reason that does not concern you i am even a little gratified i have told you that she told mr goodwin that bottweill had torn up the marriage license and put the pieces in his wastebasket and they werent there when mr goodwin looked for them and the wastebasket hadnt been emptied since early thursday evening it was difficult to conceive a reason for anyone to fish around in the wastebasket to remove those pieces so presumably miss dickey lied and if she lied about the license the rest of what she told mr goodwin was under suspicion wolfe upturned a palm why would she tell him that bottweill was going to marry her if it wasnt true surely a stupid thing to do since he would inevitably learn the truth but it wasnt so stupid if she knew that bottweill would soon die indeed it was far from stupid if she had already put the poison in the bottle it would purge her of motive or at least help it was a fair surmise that at their meeting in his office thursday evening bottweill had told her not that he would marry her but that he had decided to marry miss quon and she decided to kill him and proceeded to do so and it must be admitted that she would probably never have been exposed but for the complications injected by santa claus and my resulting intervention have you any comment miss dickey cramer left his chair commanding her dont answer im running this now but she spoke cherry took those pieces from the wastebasket she did it she killed him she started up but purley had her arm and cramer told her moving for her she didnt go there to meet a blackmailer and you did look in her bag purley ill watch her ix cherry quon was back in the red leather chair the others had gone and she and wolfe and i were alone they hadnt put cuffs on margot dickey but purley had kept hold of her arm as they crossed the threshold with cramer right behind saul panzer no longer in custody had gone along by request mrs jerome and leo had been the first to leave kiernan had asked cherry if he could take her home but wolfe had said no he wanted to speak with her privately and kiernan and hatch had left together which showed a fine christmas spirit since hatch had made no exceptions when he said he despised all of them cherry was on the edge of the chair spine straight hands together in her lap you didnt do it the way i said she chirped without steel no wolfe agreed but i did it he was curt you ignored one complication the possibility that you had killed bottweill yourself i didnt i assure you i couldnt very well send you one of the notes from santa claus under the circumstances but if those notes had flushed no prey if none of them had gone to the rendezvous without first notifying the police i would have assumed that you were guilty and would have proceeded to expose you how i dont know i let that wait on the event and now that miss dickey has taken the bait and betrayed herself it doesnt matter her eyes had widened you really thought i might have killed kurt certainly a woman capable of trying to blackmail me to manufacture evidence of murder would be capable of anything and speaking of evidence while there can be no certainty about a jurys decision when a personable young woman is on trial for murder now that miss dickey is manifestly guilty you may be sure that mr cramer will dig up all he can get and there should be enough that brings me to the point i wanted to speak about in the quest for evidence you will all be questioned exhaustively and repeatedly it will we wouldnt cherry put in if you had done it the way i said that would have been proof i preferred my way wolfe having a point to make was controlling himself it will be an ordeal for you they will question you at length about your talk with bottweill yesterday morning at breakfast wanting to know all that he said about his meeting with miss dickey in his office thursday evening and under the pressure of inquisition you might inadvertently let something slip regarding what he told you about santa claus if you do they will certainly follow it up i strongly advise you to avoid making such a slip even if they believe you the identity of santa claus is no longer important since they have the murderer and if they come to me with such a tale ill have no great difficulty dealing with it he turned a hand over and in the end they probably wont believe you theyll think you invented it for some cunning and obscure purposeas you say you are an orientaland all you would get for it would be more questions they might even suspect that you were somehow involved in the murder itself they are quite capable of unreasonable suspicions so i suggest these considerations as much on your behalf as on mine i think you will be wise to forget about santa claus she was eyeing him straight and steady i like to be wise she said im sure you do miss quon i still think you should have done it my way but its done now is that all he nodded thats all she looked at me and it took a second for me to realise that she was smiling at me i thought it wouldnt hurt to smile back and did she left the chair and came to me extending a hand and i arose and took it she looked up at me i would like to shake hands with mr wolfe but i know he doesnt like to shake hands you know mr goodwin it must be a very great pleasure to work for a man as clever as mr wolfe so extremely clever it has been very exciting to be here now i say goodby she turned and went dorothy salisbury davis b dorothy salisbury daviss characterdriven fiction marks her as a crime writer rather than an author of detectionoriented whodunits particularly in her short stories she rarely relies on series sleuths or on puzzling the reader with the facts of the case more fascinated by psychological motivation than by material motive even in stories featuring police detectives she would rather toy with their relationships to the criminals than dog their footsteps as they follow police procedure davis became a mystery writers of america grand master in spanning nearly four decades of the genres development her highly respected work is very significant in placing value on the inner lives of her characters and granting dignity to female characters in particular in the early part of her career when many female characters were portrayed as helpless women in jeopardy davis was endowing her women with intelligence and stamina rather than mere beauty and pluck born in chicago davis spent her childhood and adolescence on midwestern farms and her adulthood in or near cities this dual background is used to advantage in her fiction the rural setting and smalltown mentality are often essential to the atmosphere of her short stories while the city is more likely to provide the large canvas for her longer works she claims that she left the farm only physically taking the experience with her into later life she felt similarly about her catholic faith although she has stated that she turned to mystery writing because she was quite certain that she did not wish to write about herself her work reveals a woman anchored in everyday smalltown reality who nonetheless has a penchant for puzzling out large philosophical questions about just what it means to be human accidental insights quiet but traumatic discoveriesthese are davis s forte her own life was jarred by her accidental discovery when she was seventeen that she was adopted the whole room tilted over on its side and then somehow fell back into place again she recalled i put everything back the way i found it except me this is what her fiction does the order of things is shattered and then put back together but is never quite the same a matter of public notice incorporates more police detection than do most of davis s stories but even while the author would like us to wonder whodunit her greater concern is to induce us to question ourselves a matter of public notice the victim mrs mary philips was the estranged wife of clement philips of this city who is now being sought by the police for questioning nancy fox reread the sentence it was from the rockland minnesota gazette reporting the latest of three murders to occur in the city within a month estranged wife was the phrase that gave her pause common newspaper parlance it might be but for her it held a special meaning for all its commonplaceness it most often signals the tragic story of a woman suddenly alonea story that she nancy fox could tell oh how very well she could tell itbeing now an estranged wife herself how she wondered had mary philips taken her estrangement from a husband she probably once adored did he drink gamble was he unfaithful reason enoughany one of themfor some women or was it a cruelty surprised in him that had started the falling away of love piece by piece like the petals from a wasting flower had the making of the final decision consumed mary philipss every thought for months and had the moment of telling it been too terrible to remember and did it recur fragmenting the peace it was supposed to have brought did the sudden aloneness leave her with the feeling that part of her was missing that she might never again be a whole person idle questions surely to ask now of mrs philips mary philips age thirtynine occupation beauty operator was deadstrangled at the rear of her shop with an electric cord at the hands of an unknown assailant and clement philips was being sought by the policein point of fact by captain edward allan fox of the rockland force which was why nancy fox had read the story so interestedly in the first place clement philips was sought found and dismissed having been two thousand miles from rockland at the time of mary philipss murder several others picked up after each of the three murders were also dismissed it was only natural that these suspects were getting testy talking about their rights the chief of police was getting testy also his was a long history of political survival in rockland only in recent years had his work appeared worthy of public confidence and that was due to the addition since the war of captain fox to the force fox knew it no one knew his own worth better than the fox did and he knew how many years past retirement the old chief had stretched his tenure the chief paced back and forth before captain foxs desk grinding one hand into the other behind his back i never thought the day would come when wed turn up such a maniac in this town he doesnt belong here fox ah but he doesby right of conquest fox said with the quiet sort of provocation he knew grated on the old man the chief whirled on him you never had such a good time in your life did you fox sighed he was accustomed to the bombast the show of wrath that made his superior seem almost a caricature he did not have to take it the last of the chiefs whipping boys was the custodian now of the city morgue once or twice before sir fox said his eyes unwavering before the chiefs the old man gave ground he knew who was running the force and he was not discontented he had correctly estimated foxs ambition what fox had of power he had only with the old mans sanction in this mornings brief for me and the mayor you made quite a thing of the fact that all three victims were separated from their husbands now im not very deep in this psychology businessand the missus and i havent ever been separated more than the weekend it took to bury her sisterso youre going to have to explain what you meant does this separation from their husbands make em moreahattractive is that what youre getting at more willing fox could feel a sudden pulsethrob at his temple it was a lechers picture the old man had conjured with his words and gestures and his reference to foxs own vulnerabilitynancy having left himstirred him to a fury a weaker man would not have been able to control but he managed it saying only more availableand therefore more susceptible to the advances of their assailant the old man pulled at the loose skin of his throat its interesting fox how you got at it from the womans point of view the mayor says it makes damn good reading thank you sir fox said for something that obviously was not intended as a compliment do you remember thomas coyne thomas coyne the chief repeated the carpenterthe friend of elsie troys husband fox prompted elsie troy had been the first of the three victims weve picked him up again no better alibi this time than lastthis time his landlady i think hes too damned smug to have the conscience most men live with so ive set a little trap for him i thought maybe youd like to be there think you can make a case against him fox rose arid took the reports from where the old man had put them chief he said then there are perhaps a half dozen men in rockland against whom a case could be made including myself the old mans jaw sagged a lot of other people were also unsure of ed foxof the working mechanism they suspected ran him instead of a heart lets see this coyne fellow the chief said i dont have much taste for humour at a time like this i was only pointing up sir that our killers mania is not apparent to either friends or victimsuntil it is too late the old man grunted and thrust his bent shoulders as far back as they would goin subconscious imitation of the foxs military bearing on the way to the sun roomso called because of the brilliance of its lightingwhere thomas coyne was waiting the chief paused and asked is it safe to say for sure now that elsie troy was the first victim that we dont have a transient killer with rockland just one stop on his itinerary there had been several indications of such a possibility i think we may assume that elsie troy was the beginning fox said i think now that her murder was a random business unpremeditated she was killed at nightin her bedroom with the lights on and the window shades up she was fully dressed unmolested it wasnt a setup for murder it was pure luck that someone didnt see it happening but having walked out of elsie troys house a free man her assailant got a new sense of powera thrill hed never had in his life and then there began in him what amounted to a craving for murder how he chooses victims i dont know thats why i called attention to the the state of suspension in the marriages of the victims fox shrugged at least thats my reconstruction of the pattern you make it sound like you were there the old man said yes fox said i suppose i do he watched the old man bull his neck and plow down the hall ahead of him contemplating the bit of sadism in himselfin he suspected all policemen it was their devil as was avarice the plague of merchants conceit the foe of actors complacency the doctors demon pride the clergymans he believed firmly that mans worst enemy was within himself his own fox thought grimly had cost him a wife and beyond that god almighty knew what else there were times since nancys going when he felt the very structure of his being tremble there was no joy without her only the sometimes bitter pleasure of enduring pain coyne sat in the bright light as fox had expected with the serenity of a religious mendicant his arms folded he could wait out eternity by his manner it was unnatural behaviour for any man under police inquisition fox was himself very casual well tom its about time for us to start all over again you know the chief coyne made a gesture of recognition the chief merely glared down at him his face a wrinkled mask of distaste april twentyninth fox led that was the night you decided finally that you had time to fix mrs troys back steps afternoon coyne corrected i was home at night what do you call the dividing line between afternoon and night darkat night it gets dark sir and you want it understood that you were home before dark i was home before dark coyne said calmly there had never been reference in the newspaper to the hour of elsie troys death partly because the medical examiner could put it no closer than between seven and nine the month being april darkness fell by seven suppose you tell the chief just what happened while you were there nothing happened i went there on my way home from work i fixed the steps then i called in to her that the job was done she came out and said thats fine tom ill pay you next week i never did get paid but i guess that dont matter now told by melancholy rote fox thought having heard even the philosophic ending before but then most people repeated themselves under normal circumstances especially about grievances they never expected to be righted what i cant understand tom is why you decided to fix the steps that day and not say the week before coyne shrugged i just had the time then i guess she hadnt called you no sir he said with emphasis you say that as though she would not have called you under any circumstances coyne merely shrugged again as a matter of fact it was the husbandwhen they were still togetherwho asked you to repair the steps wasnt it tom i guess it was and you happened to remember it on the day she was about to be murdered i didnt plan it that way coyne said the words insolent but his manner still serene he tilted his chair back its a funny thing chief fox said heres a man commissioned to do a job on a friends house he doesnt get around to it until the home has broken up if it was me id have forgotten all about the job under those circumstancesnever done it at all so would i the chief said unless i was looking for an excuse to go there exactly fox said still in a casual voice it wouldnt be on account of you they broke up would it coyne the chief suggested coyne seemed to suppress a laugh it was the first time his effort at control showed no sir dont you like women the chief snapped im living with one now coyne said mrs turtle said fox naming coynes landlady whats wrong with that shes a widow fox did not say what was wrong with it but mr thomas coyne was not going to have it both ways he had alibied himself with mrs tuttle for the hours of all three murders a paramour was not the most believable of witnesses but then from what fox had seen of mrs tuttle he would not have called her the most believable of paramours either with deliberate ease fox then led coyne through an account of his activities on the nights of the two subsequent murders by the suspects telling they brought coyne nowhere near the scenes finally fox exchanged glances with the old man he had had more than enough of coyne by now and very little confidence that the carpenter had been worth bringing in again you can go now tom fox said but dont leave town he nodded at the uniformed policeman by the door and then after a pause by the way tom when was the last time you went swimming oh two or three weeks ago where bakers beach coyne said naming the public park fox nodded held the door for the chief and then closed it behind them that guy should go on the radio the old man said he knows all the answers seems like it fox said the second victim jane mullins had been strangled on the beach but if tom coyne as he said had gone swimming two or three weeks ago that would account for the sand found in coynes room sand and a stack of newspapersthe only clues to thomas coynes interests and a clue also to the personality of his landlady mrs tuttle was a very careless housekeeper to leave sand and old newspapers lying around for weeks she might be as careless with timeeven with the truth three strangulationsall of women who lived alonewithin a month it was enough to set the whole of a city the size of rocklandpopulation on edge as the gazette editorialised when murder can match statistics with traffic deaths it is time to investigate the investigators knowing ed fox so well nancy wondered if he had not planted that line with the gazette it had the foxs bite it would be like him if he was not getting all the cooperation he wanted from his superiors she looked at the clock and poured herself another cup of coffee she was due at the radio station at eleven her broadcast time was noon the womans way how cynical she had become about him and through him about so many things as much as anything that cynicism had enabled her to make the break the realisation that she was turning into a bitter woman with a slant on the world that made her see first the propensity for evil in a man and only incidentally his struggle against it this philosophy might make ed a good policeman but it made her a poor educator and she considered herself an educator despite his belittlement of her work a radio commentator was responsible to her audience to teach them a little truth why just a little ed had always said to that she wondered if ed thought about her at all these days when she could scarcely think of anything except him it was as though she bore his heelmark on her soul a cruel imageoh she had them for a month she had lived apart from him yet the morbid trauma of their life together still hung about her if she could not banish the memories she must find psychiatric help that would greatly amuse edone more useless occupation by his reckoning worse than useless the enemy of justice his hardest catch could escape the punishment that fit his crime by a psychiatrists testimony nancy folded the morning paper and rinsed her coffee cup strange the occupations of the three victims mary philips had operated a beauty parlour elsie troy had run a nursery school she could hear ed lecture on that why have children if you pushed them out of the house in rompers and poor jane mullins had written advertising copyto ed perhaps the most useless nonsense of all well that would give ed something in common with the murderercontempt for his victims ed always liked to have a little sympathy for the murderer it made him easier to find and no man ever suffered such anguish of soul as did ed fox at the hour of his mans execution there surely was the worst moment in all her five years of marriage to him the night mort simmons was executed simmons had shot a man and ed had made the arrest and got the confession nancy had known her husband was suffering and she had ventured to console him with some not very original remarks about his having only done his duty and that doubts were perfectly natural at such an hour doubts he had screamed at her i have no more doubt about his guilt than the devil waiting for him at the gates of hell she had thought a long time about that slowly then the realisation had come to her that ed fox suffered when such a man died because in the pursuit and capture of him ed identified himself with the criminal and fast upon that realisation the thought had taken hold of her that never in their marriage had she been that close to him nancy opened her hand and saw the marks of her nails in the palm she looked at her nails they needed polish a beauty operator mary philips if nancy had been in the habit of having her hair done by a professional she might possibly have known mrs philips the shop was in the neighbourhood where she and ed had lived where ed still lived she caught up her purse and brief case and forced her thoughts onto a recipe for which she had no appetite ed was not troubled that way in his work damn it fox give them something theyre riding my back like a cartload of monkeys this was the old mans complaint on the third day after mary philipss murder reporters were coming into rockland from all over the country the mayor had turned over the facilities of his own office to them so captain fox sat down and composed a description of a man who might have been the slayer he did it aware of his cynicism the state police laboratory had been unable to bring out any really pertinent physical evidence in any of the cases the murderer was a wily onea maniac or a genius except in the instance of elsie troy fox could not help but dwell on that random start to so successful a career the detective stood over the stenographer while she typed the descriptiontwenty copies on the electric machine he then dictated a few lines calculated to counteract the description to placate the rising hysteria of all the lonely women in rockland so many lonely women whether or not they lived alone did nancy feel alarmed he wondered if she did she had not called on him for reassurance but then she would not there was that streak of stubborn pride in her that made her run like a wounded animal from the hand most willing to help fortyeight complaints have already been investigated twentyone suspects questioned give them statistics fox thought nowadays they mean more to people than words maybe figures didnt lie but they made a convincing camouflage for the truth he handed out the release over the chief of polices name and found himself free once more to do the proper work of a detective something unrelated to public relations suspect number had been waiting for over an hour in the sun room it gave fox a degree of satisfaction to know that he was theredeacon alvin rugg rugg with two gs g as in god he thought the young man was a religious fanaticeither a fanatic or a charlatan possibly both in foxs mind and he was the foxs own special catch having been flushed out in the policemans persistent search for something the three women might have had in common besides the shedding of their husbands all threeelsie troy jane mullins and mary philipswere interested in a revivalist sect called church of the morning on his way to the sun room fox changed his mind about tackling the suspect there why not treat him as if he were only a witnessthe better to disarm him he had no police record young mr rugg except for a violation of the peace ordinance in a nearby town the complaint had been filed against his father and himselftheir zeal had simply begat too large a crowd fox had the young man brought to the office and there he offered him the most comfortable chair in the room rugg chose a straight one instead fox thought he might prove rugged rugg the lithe youth wore his hair crested around his head a little like a brushedup halo for it was almost the colour of gold his eyes were large blue and vacuous though no doubt some would call them deep church of the morning fox started trying without much success to keep the cynicism from his voice when did you join up i was called at birth alvin replied with a rotish piety he was older than he looked fox realised and a sure phoney how old are you rugg twenty lets see your draft registration this is no newspaper interview thirtytwo rugg amended wistful as a woman what do you do for a living odd jobs im a handyman when im not doing the lords work how do you get these these odd jobs my father recommends me that would be the reverend rugg the young man noddedthere was scarcely the shadow of a beard on his face fox was trying to calculate how the women to whom his father recommended him would feel about alvin of the halo fox himself would have had more feeling for a goldfish but then he was not a lonely woman he must look up some of them those still among the living fox had gone to the revival tent the night beforehe and onetenth the population of rockland almost people it did not seem so extraordinary then that all three victims had chanced to catch the fervour of the church of the morning i suppose you talk religion with your employers that is why i am for hire captain the arrogance of an angel on its way to hell fox thought who was your mother he snapped on the chance that this was the young mans point of vulnerability a magdalen rugg said i have never asked further my father is a holy man fox muttered a vulgarity beneath his breath he was a believer in orthodoxy himself revivalists were not for him especially one like reverend rugg whom he had heard last night speak of this boy this golden lad as sent to him like a pure spirit a rewardthis golden lad of thirtytwo the reason i asked you to come in alvin fox said forcing amiability upon himself and quite as though he had not sent two officers to pick rugg up i thought you might be able to help us on these murders youve heard about them i i had thought of coming in myself rugg said when did that thought occur to you well two or three weeks ago at leastthe first time i mean you see i worked for that mrs troycleaned her windows things like that her husband was a bitter vengeful man he doesnt have the spiritual consolation his wife had a nice distinction of the present and past tenses fox thought but what troy did have was an unbreakable alibi five witnesses to his continuous presence at a poker table on the night elsie troy was slain she told you that about him fox prompted cheerfully well not exactly she wanted to make a donation to the church but she couldnt he had their bank account tied up she said the hesitation before the last two words was marked by fox either the ruggs had investigated elsie troys finances he thought or alvin was covering up an intimacy he feared the detective suspected or had evidence of but mrs troy ran a nursery school fox said blandly i dont suppose she took the little ones in out of charity do you her husband had put up the money for the school he insisted his investment should be paid back to him first i wouldnt call that unreasonable would you alvin a trifle unchivalrous perhaps but not unreasonable a vivid dislike came into the boys the mans eyes he had suddenly made an enemy of him fox thought with grim satisfaction he would soon provoke the unguarded word didnt you and mrs troy talk about anything besides money we talked about faith rugg said and then clamped his lips tight did you also do chores for mrs mullins no but she offered once to get me a messengers job at the advertising company where she worked said i could do a lot of good there ill bet fox said and how about mary philips what was she going to do for you he resisted the temptation to refer to the beauty shop nothing she was a very nice woman that fox thought was a revelatory answer it had peace of soul in it the captain then proceeded to turn the heat on deacon rugg and before half an hour was over he got from the golden boy the admission that both elsie troy and jane mullins had made amatory advances seeking more than religion the selfwidowed starvelings they kicked out husbands and then welcomed any quack in trousers lady breadwinners fox could feel the explosion of his own anger it spiced his powers of inquisition alvin rugg was then given such mental punishment as might have made a less vulnerable sinner threaten suit against the city but while the deacon lacked airtight alibis for the nights of the th of april the th of may and june nd he had been seen about his fathers tent by many people and he maintained his innocence through sweat and tears finally sobbing his protestations on his knees the extent of the foxs mercy was to leave rugg alone to compose himself and find his own way to the street until tomorrow then this is nancy fox going the womans way nancy gathered her papers so as not to make a sound the microphone could pick up the newscaster took over the next instant nancy was listening with all the concentration of her being a man about forty quick of movement near six feet tall a hundred and sixty pounds extremely agile he probably dresses conservatively and speaks softly one of his victims is thought to have been describing him when she told a friend you never know when he is going to smile or when he isnthe changes moods so quickly nancy pressed her lips together and leaned far away from the table her breathing was loud enough to carry into the mike that was her own husband the newscaster was describinged fox himself right down to the unpredictable smile actually it could be any of a dozen men she tried to tell herself of course any of a hundred what nonsense to put such a description over the air she had regained her composure by the time the reporter had finished his newscast then she had coffee with him as she often did but what a fantastic experience fantasythat was the only word for it the description had been part of a release from the office of the chief of police which meant it had eds own approval but now im going to tell you what it sounded like to me the newsman said like somebodymaybe on the insidedeliberately muddying up the tracks i tell you somebody down there knows more than were getting in these handouts what a strange idea nancy cried and gave a deprecating laugh as hollow as the clink of her dime on the counter she spent the next couple of hours in the municipal library trying to learn something about water rights a bill on the water supply was before the city council two years of research would have been more adequate to the subject she discovered once more she had dived into something only to crack her head in the shallows of her own ignorance then she drove out to the county fairgrounds to judge the cake contest of the grange women she fled the conversational suggestion that the murderer might be scouting there some women squealed with a sort of ecstatic terror a feeling of deepening urgency pursued her from one chore to the next there was something she ought to do something she must return to and attend to and yet the specific identity of this duty did not reveal itself sometimes she seemed on the brink of comprehension but she escaped oh yes that much of herself she knew she was fleeing it not it fleeing her with that admission she cornered herself beyond flight there was a question hanging in the dark reaches of her mind unasked now even as it was five years ago since the night mort simmons died in the electric chair it clung like monstrous fungi at the end of every cavern through which she fled and by leaving her husbands house she had not escaped it ask it now she demandedask it now she drove off the pavement and braked the car to a shrieking halt all right she cried aloud i ask it before godis ed fox capable of but she could not finish the sentence she bent her head over the wheel and sobbed eddie oh eddie dear forgive me without food without rest she drove herself until the day was spent and with it most of her energy only her nerves remained taut she returned just before dark to the apartment she had subleased from a friend it was in no way her home she had changed nothing in it not even the leaf on the calendar and so the place gave her no message when she enteredneither warning nor welcome she left the hall door ajar while she groped her way to the table where the lamp stood and at the moment of switching on the light she sensed that someone had followed her into the apartment before she could fully see him he caught her into his arms dont please dont she cried her struggling but made him tighten his grip for gods sake nancy its me i know she said and leaped away as ed gave up his grasp of her she could taste the retch of fear she whirled and looked at him as if she were measuring the distance between them you knew he said incredulously you knew that it was me and yet you acted like that she could only stare at him and nod in giddy acknowledgment of the truth his hands fell limp to his sides my god he murmured a world of revelation opened to her in that mute gesture in the simple dropping of his hands neither of them moved she felt the ache that comes with unshed tears gathering in her throat as the bitter taste of fear now ran out it was a long moment until the tears were loosed and welled into her eyes a moment in which they measured each other in the others understandingor in the others misunderstanding i thought i might surprise an old loveif i surprised you he said flatly and then when i realised you were afraid it seemed so crazyso inconsiderate a thing to do with a maniac abroad he stood selfpilloried and miserableimmobile lest one move of his start up the fear in her again at last she managed the words eddie i do love you fox raised his arms and held them out to her and she ran to him with utter abandon presently he asked how long have you been afraid of me i think since the night mort simmons was executed she said and then clinging to him again oh my dear my beloved husband he nodded and lifted her fingers to his lips how did you conceal it fear kills love they say like that he snapped his fingers i never called it fear she said lifting her chinand that she thought that inward courage was what he mistook for pridenot until she bit her lip against the confession of the final truth until the murder of one two three women fox said evenly with whose lives you knew id have no sympathy i didnt know that exactly she said i only knew your prejudices pride and prejudice he mused he pushed her gently an arms distance from him take another look at my prejudices nancy and see who suffers most by them may i come home now eddie soon darling very soon he picked up his hat from where it had fallen in their struggle but you must let me tell you when he should have known it really fox thought closing the apartment door behind him he was so alert to it in others he should have seen the fear grow in her since the night she caught him nakedsouled suffering the death of mort simmons suppose that night he had tried to explain what had happened to him how could he have said that it was not mort simmonss guilt he doubted but his own innocence how tell her that at the hour of his death mort simmons was in a very special way the victim of ed fox fox drove to within a block of thomas coynes boarding house he parked the car and walked up the street to where the tail he had put on coyne was sitting a newspaper before him in a nondescript ford fox slipped in beside him coynes in there the other detective said been there since he came home from work ten minutes ago he went down to the corner for a paper came right back fox decided to talk first with mrs tuttle he approached her by way of the kitchen door identified himself and got a cup of warmedover coffee at the table a voluble lusty goodnatured woman she responded easily to his questionwhether she was interested in the church of the morning she shook her head fox described deacon alvin rugg and his relationship to the murdered women mrs tuttle clucked disapproval and admitted she had heard of him but where she could not remember to the captains direct question as to whether she had ever seen the golden boy she shook her head again i tell you mr fox i like my men and my whiskey proof and my religion in a church with a stone foundation fox laughed anybody in the house here interested in the revival what you want to know she said looking at him sidewide is if it was tom coyne who told me about him isnt that it fox admitted to the bush he had been beating around id like to know if coyne has shown any interest in the sect i dont know for sure he takes sudden fancies that one does i understand he has a very deep fancy for you fox said bluntly mrs tuttle frowned the good nature fleeing her face she took his cup and saucer to the sink and clattered it into the dish basin im sorry to be clumsy about a delicate matter fox said getting up from the table and following to where he could see her face shame or wrath he wondered perhaps both it was very necessary to coyne that he confide that information to the police he elaborated in subtle quest of further information was it she said then maybe it was necessary for him to come to me in the first place can you tell me that mister if you tell me when it was he first came to youin that sense i mean fox said a couple of nights ago she said till then it was just well we were pals thats all fox examined his own fingernails he didnt take very long to tell about it did he now answer my question to you she said did he come just so he could tell you him and me werelike that fox ventured to lay his hand on her arm she pulled away from his touch as though it were fire her shame was deep her affair shallow he thought just stay in the kitchen he said she would have her answer soon enough he moved through the hall and alerted the detective on watch at the front then he went upstairs thomas coyne was sitting in his room the newspaper open on the table before him a pencil in his hand he had been caught in the obviously pleasurable act of marking an item in the paper and he gathered himself up on seeing foxlike a bather surprised in the nude it gave an ironic sequence to the pretence on which fox had come i wanted to see your swim trunks captain fox said coyne was still gaping slowly he uncoiled himself and then pointed to the dresser drawer you get them fox said i dont like to invade your privacy he turned partially away in fact to suggest that he was unaware of the newspaper over which he had surprised the man he waited until coyne reached the dresser and then moved toward the table but even there fox pointed to the picture on the wall beyond it and remarked that he remembered its like from his school days a similar print he said had hung in the study hall on and on he talked and if coyne was aware of the detectives quick scrutiny of his marked newspaper it was less fearful for the man to pretend he had not seen it my wife ellen having left my bed and board i am no longer responsible fox had seen it so likely had the husbands of mary philips and jane mullins and elsie troy given public notice sometime or other the decision he needed to reach instantly was whether he had sufficient evidence to indict tom coyne it was so tempting to let him now pursue the pattern once moreup to its dire culmination the detective stood his arms folded while coyne brought the swim trunks here you are captain he said havent worn them much fox said not touching them its early coyne said so it is fox said the fifth of june bakers beach just opened memorial day didnt it there was no serenity in coyne now he realised the trap into which he had betrayed himself while under questioning by fox and the chief of police so many things he had made seem righteven an affair with mrs tuttle and now that one little thing by foxs prompting was wrong he would not have been allowed in the waters of bakers beach before the thirtieth of may in order to account for the sand in his room following the murder of jane mullins he had said he had gone swimming at bakers beach two or three weeks before before midnight coyne confessed to the three homicides the last two premeditated he had not intended to kill elsie troy but he had been watching her behaviour with young alvin rugg and as her husbands friend he had taken the excuse of fixing her steps to gain her company and reproach her she had called him a nasty little man and where matters had gone from that he said he could not clearly remember except that he killed her he was sure because of the wonderful exhilaration it gave him after he had done itso wonderful it had to be repeated the chief had pride in his eyes commending captain fox for so fine a job they went upstairs together to see the mayor and there the chief took major credit as his due he announced however that this would be his last case before retirement and he put his arm about captain fox as the reporters were invited in fox asked to be excused damn it man youve got to do the talking the chief protested yes sir if you say so fox said but first i want to call my wife by all means the chief said here use the mayors phone nancy answered on the first ring will you pick me up tonight my dear on your way home fox said ellery queen frederic dannay daniel nathan and manfred bennington lee manfred lepofsky were cousins who together created the highly popular detective ellery queen both were born in brooklyn new york attended boys high school in the borough and began their careers in manhattan dannay worked as a writer and an art director for an advertising agency while lee wrote publicity for film studios when they were twentythree the two decided to enter a detectivefiction contest they collaborated on what came to be the roman hat mystery using a very sophisticated young man named ellery queen as a mystery writer and amateur sleuth inspector richard queen of the new york police department is also introduced as ellerys doting father dannay and lee used the ellery queen name for themselves as well so that it is memorable for referring to both character and coauthors the story originally won the contest but the prize went to another author when the magazine that held the contest changed hands even so the roman hat mystery was published the following yearand the rest is history the two also produced a fourbook series in the early s under the pen name barnaby ross but ellery queen was quickly and hugely popular and occupied most of their time queen promptly reappeared in the french powder mystery and the dutch shoe mystery and in the two young men quit their jobs to write full time by the early s other writersincluding avram davidson richard deming paul w fairman edward d hoch stephen marlowe talmadge powell theodore sturgeon and john holbrook vanceusing plots created by dannay had been pulled into the ellery queen persona turning out books under the supervision of the cousins by the time of dannays death at least million ellery queen books had been sold worldwide and the ellery queen mystery magazine was maintaining some semblance of a market for short fiction the two helped found the mystery writers of america and their peers gave them four edgar awards and the grand master award the adventure of abraham lincolns clue illustrates the typical queen technique it is solidly in the classical tradition with the plot revolving around a clever puzzle whose solution requires the sleuth to make brilliant deductions from clues that are displayed to the reader who is challenged to outwit the detective the mere hint of romantic interest is also typical of both the form and the times the adventure of abraham lincolns clue the case began on the outskirts of an upstate new york city with the dreadful name of eulalia behind the flaking shutters of a fat and curlicued house with architectural dandruff recalling for all the world some blowsy exbloomer girl from the gay nineties of its origin the owner a formerly wealthy man named dicampo possessed a grandeur not shared by his property although it was no less fallen into ruin his falcons face more florentine than victorian waslike the houseravaged by time and the inclemencies of fortune but haughtily so and indeed dicampo wore his scurfy purple velvet house jacket like the prince he was entitled to call himself but did not he was proud and stubborn and useless and he had a lovely daughter named bianca who taught at a eulalia grade school and through marvels of economy supported them both how lorenzo san marco borgheseruffo dicampo came to this decayed estate is no concern of ours the presence there this day of a man named harbidger and a man named tungston however is to the point they had come harbidger from chicago tungston from philadelphia to buy something each wanted very much and dicampo had summoned them in order to sell it the two visitors were collectors harbidgers passion being lincoln tungstens poe the lincoln collector an elderly man who looked like a migrant fruit picker had plucked his fruits well harbidger was worth about every dollar of which was at the beck of his mania for lincolniana tungston who was almost as rich had the aging body of a poet and the eyes of a starving panther armament that had served him well in the wars of poeana i must say mr dicampo remarked harbidger that your letter surprised me he paused to savour the wine his host had poured from an ancient and honourable bottle dicampo had filled it with california claret before their arrival may i ask what has finally induced you to offer the book and document for sale to quote lincoln in another context mr harbidger said dicampo with a shrug of his wasted shoulders the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present in short a hungry man sells his blood only if its of the right type said old tungston unmoved youve made that book and document less accessible to collectors and historians dicampo than the gold in fort knox have you got them here id like to examine them no other hand will ever touch them except by right of ownership lorenzo dicampo replied bitterly he had taken a misers glee in his lucky finds vowing never to part with them now forced by his need to sell them he was like a suspicioncaked old prospector who stumbling at last on pay dirt draws cryptic maps to keep the world from stealing the secret of its location as i informed you gentlemen i represent the book as bearing the signatures of poe and lincoln and the document as being in lincolns hand i am offering them with the customary proviso that they are returnable if they should prove to be not as represented and if this does not satisfy you and the old prince actually rose let us terminate our business here and now sit down sit down mr dicarripo harbidger said no one is questioning your integrity snapped old tungston its just that im not used to buying sight unseen if theres a moneyback guarantee well do it your way lorenzo dicampo reseated himself stiffly very well gentlemen then i take it you are both prepared to buy oh yes said harbidger what is your price oh no said dicampo what is your bid the lincoln collector cleared his throat which was full of slaver if the book and document are as represented mr dicampo you might hope to get from a dealer or realize at auctionoh i offer you said tungston said harbidger said tungston said harbidger tungston showed his fangs he said harbidger fell silent and dicampo waited he did not expect miracles to these men five times was of less moment than the undistinguished wine they were smacking their lips over but they were veterans of many a hard auctionroom campaign and a collectors victory tasted very nearly as sweet for the price as for the prize so the impoverished prince was not surprised when the lincoln collector suddenly said would you be good enough to allow mr tungston and me to talk privately for a moment dicampo rose and strolled out of the room to gaze sombrely through a cracked window at the jungle growth that had once been his italian formal gardens it was the poe collector who summoned him back harbidger has convinced me that for the two of us to try to outbid each other would simply run the price up out of all reason were going to make you a sporting proposition ive proposed to mr tungsten and he has agreed nodded harbidger that our bid for the book and document be each of us is prepared to pay that sum and not a penny more so that is how the screws are turned said dicampo smiling but i do not understand if each of you makes the identical bid which of you gets the book and document ah grinned the poe man thats where the sporting proposition comes in you see mr dicampo said the lincoln man we are going to leave that decision to you even the old prince who had seen more than his share of the astonishing was astonished he looked at the two rich men really for the first time i must confess he murmured that your compact is an amusement permit me he sank into thought while the two collectors sat expectantly when the old man looked up he was smiling like a fox the very thing gentlemen from the typewritten copies of the document i sent you you both know that lincoln himself left a clue to a theoretical hiding place for the book which he never explained some time ago i arrived at a possible solution to the presidents little mystery i propose to hide the book and document in accordance with it you mean whichever of us figures out your interpretation of the lincoln clue and finds the book and document where you will hide them mr dicampo gets both for the agreed price that is it exactly the lincoln collector looked dubious i dont know oh come harbidger said tungsten eyes glittering a deal is a deal we accept dicampo now what you gentlemen will of course have to give me a little time shall we say three days ellery let himself into the queen apartment tossed his suitcase aside and set about opening windows he had been out of town for a week on a case and inspector queen was in atlantic city attending a police convention breathable air having been restored ellery sat down to the weeks accumulation of mail one envelope made him pause it had come by airmail special delivery it was postmarked four days earlier and in the lower left corner in red flamed the word urgent the printed return address on the flap said lsmbr dicampo post office box southern district eulalia ny the initials of the name had been crossed out and bianca written above them the enclosure in a large agitated female hand on inexpensive notepaper said dear mr queen the most important detective book in the world has disappeared will you please find it for me phone me on arrival at the eulalia rr station or airport and i will pick you up bianca dicampo a yellow envelope then caught his eye it was a telegram dated the previous day why have i not heard from you stop am in desperate need your services bianca dicampo he had no sooner finished reading the telegram than the telephone on his desk trilled it was a longdistance call mr queen throbbed a contralto voice thank heaven ive finally got through to you ive been calling all day ive been away said ellery and you would be miss bianca dicampo of eulalia in two words miss dicampo why me in two words mr queen abraham lincoln ellery was startled you plead a persuasive case he chuckled its true im an incurable lincoln addict how did you find out well never mind your letter refers to a book miss dicampo which book the husky voice told him and certain other provocative things as well so you will come mr queen tonight if i could suppose i drive up first thing in the morning i ought to make eulalia by noon harbidger and tungston are still around i take it oh yes theyre staying at a motel downtown would you ask them to be there the moment he hung up ellery leaped to his bookshelves he snatched out his volume of murder for pleasure the historical work on detective stories by his good friend howard haycraft and found what he was looking for on page and young william dean howells thought it significant praise to assert of a nominee for president of the united states the bent of his mind is mathematical and metaphysical and he is therefore pleased with the absolute and logical method of poes tales and sketches in which the problem of mystery is given and wrought out into everyday facts by processes of cunning analysis it is said that he suffers no year to pass without a perusal of this author abraham lincoln subsequently confirmed this statement which appeared in his little known campaign biography by howells in the instance is chiefly notable of course for its revelation of a little suspected affinity between two great americans very early the next morning ellery gathered some papers from his files stuffed them into his briefcase scribbled a note for his father and ran for his car eulaliabound he was enchanted by the dicampo house which looked like something out of poe by charles addams and for other reasons by bianca who turned out to be a genetic product supreme of northern italy with titian hair and mediterranean blue eyes and a figure that needed only some solid steaks to qualify her for miss universe competition also she was in deep mourning so her conquest of the queen heart was immediate and complete he died of a cerebral haemorrhage mr queen bianca said dabbing at her absurd little nose in the middle of the second night after his session with mr harbidger and mr tungston so lorenzo san marco borgheseruffo dicampo was unexpectedly dead bequeathing the lovely bianca neardestitution and a mystery the only things of value father really left me are that book and the lincoln document the they now represent would pay off fathers debts and give me a fresh start but i cant find them mr queen and neither can mr harbidger and mr tungstonwholl be here soon by the way father hid the two things as he told them he would but where weve ransacked the place tell me about the book miss dicampo as i said over the phone its called the gift the christmas annual that contained the earliest appearance of edgar allan poes the purloined letter published in philadelphia by carey hart bound in red at biancas nod ellery said you understand that an ordinary copy of the gift isnt worth more than what makes your fathers copy unique is that double autograph you mentioned thats what he said mr queen i wish i had the book here to show youthat beautifully handwritten edgar allan poe on the flyleaf and under poes signature the signature abraham lincoln poes own copy once owned signed and read by lincoln ellery said slowly yes that would be a collectors item for the ages by the way miss dicampo whats the story behind the other piecethe lincoln document bianca told him what her father had told her one morning in the spring of abraham lincoln opened the rosewood door of his bedroom in the southwest corner of the second floor of the white house and stepped out into the redcarpeted hall at the unusually late hourfor himof am he was more accustomed to beginning his work day at six but as lorenzo dicampo had reconstructed events mr lincoln that morning had lingered in his bedchamber he had awakened at his usual hour but instead of leaving immediately on dressing for his office he had pulled one of the cane chairs over to the round table with its gasfed reading lamp and sat down to reread foes the purloined letter in his copy of the annual it was a dreary morning and the natural light was poor the president was alone the folding doors to mrs lincolns bedroom remained closed impressed as always with poes tale mr lincoln on this occasion was struck by a whimsical thought and apparently finding no paper handy he took an envelope from his pocket discarded its enclosure slit the two short edges so that the envelope opened out into a single sheet and began to write on the blank side describe it to me please its a long envelope one that must have contained a bulky letter it is addressed to the white house but there is no return address and father was never able to identify the sender from the handwriting we do know that the letter came through the regular mails because there are two lincoln stamps on it lightly but unmistakably cancelled may i see your fathers transcript of what lincoln wrote out that morning on the inside of the envelope bianca handed him a typewritten copy and in spite of himself ellery felt gooseflesh rise as he read apr mr poes the purloined letter is a work of singular originality its simplicity is a masterstroke of cunning which never fails to arouse my wonder reading the tale over this morning has given me a notion suppose i wished to hide a book this very book perhaps where best to do so well as mr poe in his tale hid a letter among letters might not a book be hidden among books why if this very copy of the tale were to be deposited in a library and on purpose not recordedwould not the library of congress make a prime depositorywell might it repose there undiscovered for a generation on the other hand let us regard mr poes notion turnabout suppose the book were to be placed not amongst other books but where no book would reasonably be expected i may follow the example of mr poe and myself compose a tale of ratiocination the notion beguiles me it is nearly seven oclock later today if the vultures and my appointments leave me a few moments of leisure i may write further of my imagined hidingplace in selfreminder the hidingplace of the book is in d which ellery looked up the document ends there father said that mr lincoln must have glanced again at his watch and shamefacedly jumped up to go to his office leaving the sentence unfinished evidently he never found the time to get back to it ellery brooded evidently indeed from the moment when abraham lincoln stepped out of his bedroom that good friday morning fingering his thick gold watch on its vest chain to bid the stillunrelieved night guard his customary courteous good morning and make for his office at the other end of the hall his day was spoken for the usual patient push through the clutching crowd of favourseekers many of whom had bedded down all night on the hall carpet sanctuary in his sprawling office where he read official correspondence by am having breakfast with his familymrs lincoln chattering away about plans for the evening yearold tad of the cleft palate lisping a complaint that nobody asked me to go and young robert lincoln just returned from duty bubbling with stories about his hero ulysses grant and the last days of the war then back to the presidential office to look over the morning newspapers which lincoln had once remarked he never read but these were happy days with good news everywhere sign two documents and signal the soldier at the door to admit the mornings first caller speaker of the house schuyler colfax who was angling for a cabinet post and had to be tactfully handled and so on throughout the daythe historic cabinet meeting at am attended by general grant himself that stretched well into the afternoon a hurried lunch at almost halfpast two with mrs lincoln had this poundsunderweight man eaten his usual midday meal of a biscuit a glass of milk and an apple more visitors to see in his office including the unscheduled mrs nancy bushrod escaped slave and wife of an escaped slave and mother of three small children weeping that tom a soldier in the army of the potomac was no longer getting his pay you are entitled to your husbands pay come this time tomorrow and the tall president escorted her to the door bowing her out like i was a naturalborn lady the late afternoon drive in the barouche to the navy yard and back with mrs lincoln more work more visitors into the evening until finally at five minutes past pm abraham lincoln stepped into the white house formal coach after his wife waved and sank back to be driven off to see a play he did not much want to see our american cousin at fords theatre ellery mused over that black day in silence and like a relative hanging on the specialists yet undelivered diagnosis bianca dicampo sat watching him with anxiety harbidger and tungsten arrived in a taxi to greet ellery with the fervour of castaways grasping at a smudge of smoke on the horizon as i understand it gentlemen ellery said when he had calmed them down neither of you has been able to solve mr dicampos interpretation of the lincoln clue if i succeed in finding the book and paper where dicampo hid them which of you gets them we intend to split the payment to miss dicampo said harbidger and take joint ownership of the two pieces an arrangement growled old tungsten im against on principle in practice and by plain horse sense so am i sighed the lincoln collector but what else can we do well and the poe man regarded bianca dicampo with the icy intimacy of the cat that long ago marked the bird as its prey miss dicampo who now owns the two pieces is quite free to renegotiate a sale on her own terms miss dicampo said miss dicampo giving tungston stare for stare considers herself bound by her fathers wishes his terms stand in all likelihood then said the other millionaire one of us will retain the book the other the document and well exchange them every year or some such thing harbidger sounded unhappy only practical arrangement under the circumstances grunted tungston and he sounded unhappy but all this is academic queen unless and until the book and document are found ellery nodded the problem then is to fathom dicampos interpretation of that d in the documentd i notice miss dicampoor may i biancathat your fathers typewritten copy of the lincoln holograph text runs the and and d togetherno spacing in between is that the way it occurs in the longhand yes hmm stilld could d stand for days or the british pence or died as used in obituaries does any of these make sense to you bianca no did your father have any special interest in say pharmacology chemistry physics algebra electricity small d is an abbreviation used in all those but bianca shook her splendid head banking small d for dollars dividends hardly the girl said with a sad smile how about theatricals was your father ever involved in a play production small d stands for door in playscript stage directions mr queen ive gone through every darned abbreviation my dictionary lists and i havent found one that has a point of contact with any interest of my fathers ellery scowled at thati assume the typewritten copy is accuratethe manuscript shows no period after the d making an abbreviation unlikelyd let us concentrate on the number does the number have any significance for you yes indeed said bianca making all three men sit up but then they sank back in a few years it will represent my age and that has enormous significance but only for me im afraid youll be drawing wolf whistles at twice thirty quoth ellery warmly however could the number have crossreferred to anything in your fathers life or habits none that i can think of mr queen and bianca said having grown roses in her cheeks thank you i think said old tungsten testily we had better stick to the subject just the same bianca let me run over some thirty associations as they come to mind stop me if one of them hits a nerve the thirty tyrantswas your father interested in classical athens thirty years warin seventeenth century european history thirty alldid he play or follow tennis or did he ever live at an address that included the number ellery went on and on but to each suggestion bianca dicampo could only shake her head the lack of spacing come to think of it doesnt necessarily mean that mr dicampo chose to view the clue that way said ellery thoughtfully he might have interpreted it arbitrarily as spaced three d echoed old tungston what the devil could that mean d d is the hypothetical force or power claimed by baron von reichenbachin wasnt itto pervade the whole of nature manifests itself in magnets crystals and such which according to the excited baron explained animal magnetism and mesmerism was your father by any chance interested in hypnosis bianca or the occult not in the slightest mr queen exclaimed harbidger are you serious about all thisthis semantic sludge why i dont know said ellery i never know till i stumble over something od the word was used with prefixes toobiod the force of animal life elod the force of electricity and so forth threeod or triod the triune forceits all right mr harbidger its not ignorance on your part i just coined the word but it does rather suggest the trinity doesnt it bianca did your father tie up to the church in a personal scholarly or any other way no thats too bad really because odcapitalisedhas been a minced form of the word god since the sixteenth century or you wouldnt happen to have three bibles on the premises would you because ellery stopped with the smashing abruptness of an ordinary force meeting an absolutely immovable object the girl and the two collectors gawped bianca had idly picked up the typewritten copy of the lincoln document she was not reading it she was simply holding it on her knees but ellery sitting opposite her had shot forward in a crouch rather like a pointer and he was regarding the paper in her lap with a glare of pure discovery thats it he cried whats it mr queen the girl asked bewildered pleasethe transcript he plucked the paper from her of course hear this on the other hand let us regard mr poes notion turnabout turnabout look at the d turnaboutas i just saw it he turned the lincoln message upside down for their inspection in that position the d became p poe exploded tungsten yes crude but recognisable ellery said swiftly so now we read the lincoln clue as the hidingplace of the book is in poe there was a silence in poe said harbidger blankly in poe muttered tungsten there are only a couple of trade editions of poe in dicampos library harbidger and we went through those we looked in every book here he might have meant among the poe books in the public library miss dicampo wait bianca sped away but when she came back she was drooping it isnt we have two public libraries in eulalia and i know the head librarian in both i just called them father didnt visit either library ellery gnawed a fingernail is there a bust of poe in the house bianca or any other poeassociated object aside from books im afraid not queer he mumbled yet im positive your father interpreted the hidingplace of the book as being in poe so hed have hidden it in poe ellerys mumbling dribbled away into a tormented sort of silence his eyebrows worked up and down groucho marxfashion he pinched the tip of his nose until it was scarlet he yanked at his unoffending ears he munched on his lip until all at once his face cleared and he sprang to his feet bianca may i use your phone the girl could only nod and ellery dashed they heard him telephoning in the entrance hall although they could not make out the words he was back in two minutes one thing more he said briskly and were out of the woods i suppose your father had a key ring or a key case bianca may i have it please she fetched a key case to the two millionaires it seemed the sorriest of objects a scuffed and dirty tan leatherette case but ellery received it from the girl as if it were an artefact of historic importance from a newly discovered iv dynasty tomb he unsnapped it with concentrated love he fingered its contents like a scientist finally he decided on a certain key wait here thus mr queen and exit running i cant decide old tungsten said after a while whether that fellow is a genius or an escaped lunatic neither harbidger nor bianca replied apparently they could not decide either they waited through twenty elongated minutes at the twentyfirst they heard his car champing all three were in the front doorway as ellery strode up the walk he was carrying a book with a red cover and smiling it was a compassionate smile but none of them noticed you said bianca found said tungsten the book shouted harbidger is the lincoln holograph in it it is said ellery shall we all go into the house where we may mourn in decent privacy because ellery said to bianca and the two quivering collectors as they sat across a refectory table from him i have foul news mr tungsten i believe you have never actually seen mr dicampos book will you now look at the poe signature on the flyleaf the panther claws leaped there toward the top of the flyleaf in faded inkscript was the signature edgar allan poe the claws curled and old tungsten looked up sharply dicampo never mentioned that its a full autographhe kept referring to it as the poe signature edgar allan poe why i dont know of a single instance after his west point days when poe wrote out his middle name in an autograph and the earliest he could have signed this edition is obviously when it was published which was around the fall of in hed surely have abbreviated the allan signing edgar a poe the way he signed everything this is a forgery my god murmured bianca clearly intending no impiety she was as pale as poes lenore is that true mr queen im afraid it is ellery said sadly i was suspicious the moment you told me the poe signature on the flyleaf contained the allan and if the poe signature is a forgery the book itself can hardly be considered poes own copy harbidger was moaning and the lincoln signature underneath the poe mr queen dicampo never told me it reads abraham lincolnthe full christian name except on official documents lincoln practically always signed his name a lincoln dont tell me this lincoln autograph is a forgery too ellery forbore to look at poor bianca i was struck by the abraham as well mr harbidger when miss dicampo mentioned it to me and i came equipped to test it i have here and ellery tapped the pile of documents he had taken from his briefcase facsimiles of lincoln signatures from the most frequently reproduced of the historic documents he signed now im going to make a precise tracing of the lincoln signature on the flyleaf of the book he proceeded to do so and i shall superimpose the tracing on the various signatures of the authentic lincoln documents so he worked rapidly on his third superimposition ellery looked up yes see here the tracing of the purported lincoln signature from the flyleaf fits in minutest detail over the authentic lincoln signature on this facsimile of the emancipation proclamation its a fact of life thats tripped many a forger that nobody ever writes his name exactly the same way twice there are always variations if two signatures are identical then one must be a tracing of the other so the abraham lincoln signed on this flyleaf can be dismissed without further consideration as a forgery also its a tracing of the emancipation proclamation signature not only was this book not poes own copy it was never signedand therefore probably never ownedby lincoln however your father came into possession of the book bianca he was swindled it was the measure of bianca dicampos quality that she said quietly poor poor father nothing more harbidger was poring over the worn old envelope on whose inside appeared the dearly beloved handscript of the martyr president at least he muttered we have this do we asked ellery turn it over mr harbidger harbidger looked up scowling no youre not going to deprive me of this too turn it over ellery repeated in the same gentle way the lincoln collector obeyed reluctantly what do you see an authentic envelope of the period with two authentic lincoln stamps exactly and the united states has never issued postage stamps depicting living americans you have to be dead to qualify the earliest us stamp showing a portrait of lincoln went on sale april a year to the day after his death then a living lincoln could scarcely have used this envelope with these stamps on it as writing paper the document is spurious too i am so very sorry bianca incredibly lorenzo dicampos daughter managed a smile with her non importa signer he could have wept for her as for the two collectors harbidger was in shock but old tungston managed to croak where the devil did dicampo hide the book queen and how did you know oh that said ellery wishing the two old men would go away so that he might comfort this admirable creature i was convinced that dicampo interpreted what we now know was the forgers not lincolns clue as d read upside down or crudely poe but the hidingplace of the book is in poe led nowhere so i reconsidered p o e if those three letters of the alphabet didnt mean poe what could they mean then i remembered something about the letter you wrote me bianca youd used one of your fathers envelopes on the flap of which appeared his address post office box southern district eulalia ny if there was a southern district in eulalia it seemed reasonable to conclude that there were post offices for other points of the compass too as for instance an eastern district post office eastern po east poe poe cried bianca to answer your question mr tungston i phoned the main post office confirmed the existence of a post office east got directions as to how to get there looked for a postal box key in mr dicampos key case found the right one located the box dicampo had rented especially for the occasion unlocked itand there was the book he added hopefully and that is that and that is that bianca said when she returned from seeing the two collectors off im not going to cry over an empty milk bottle mr queen ill straighten out fathers affairs somehow right now all i can think of is how glad i am he didnt live to see the signatures and documents declared forgeries publicly as they would surely have been when they were expertised i think youll find theres still some milk in the bottle bianca i beg your pardon said bianca ellery tapped the pseudolincolnian envelope you know you didnt do a very good job describing this envelope to me all you said was that there were two cancelled lincoln stamps on it well there are i can see you misspent your childhood no little girls dont collect things do they why if youll examine these two cancelled lincoln stamps youll see that theyre a great deal more than that in the first place theyre not separate stamps theyre a vertical pairthat is one stamp is joined to the other at the horizontal edges now look at this upper stamp of the pair the mediterranean eyes widened its upside down isnt it yes its upside down said ellery and whats more while the pair have perforations all around there are no perforations between them where theyre joined what you have here young ladyand what our unknown forger didnt realise when he fished around for an authentic white house cover of the period on which to perpetrate the lincoln forgeryis what stamp collectors might call a double printing error a pair of black cent lincolns imperforate horizontally with one of the pair printed upside down no such error of the lincoln issue has ever been reported youre the owner bianca of what may well be the rarest item in us philately and the most valuable the world will little note nor long remember but dont try to prove it by bianca dicampo bill pronzini b when the private eye writers of america voted bill pronzini their lifetime achievement award in he was a mere stripling of fortyfouran age when most writers of the form are still learning but pronzini had already done just about everything the category offers and done it remarkably well pronzini born in petaluma california is the son of a farm labourer he began writing for the petaluma newspaper at fourteen attended a junior college and began writing short stories for mystery magazines in he published the snatch in which he introduced nameless a softhearted middleaged overweight and sloppy private eye endowed with all those problems that beset normal man thus began pronzinis most notable though certainly not his only contribution to the detective form the nameless series follows the ordinaryman privateeye formula already established by earlier writers but with a notable difference pronzini has said that he modelled nameless after himself having him read and collect pulp magazines smoke too much worry about his health and so on as a result the protagonists believable relationship with his policedetective best friend his wit his weakness for puns and his tendency to make mistakes take the books to a level of realism concerning character that is rarely attained in a genre where plot has long been the name of the game in addition to creating nameless pronzini has penned myriad short stories many written under pseudonyms and produced literary criticism that has earned him a welldeserved reputation as an expert on popular literature including westerns his personable nature and sense of humour are reflected in his gun in cheek and son of gun in cheek anthologies which bring together examples of prose so overdone that it becomes hilarious pronzini is known as one of the truly great collaborators and is equally at home coediting anthologies and coauthoring novels and even short stories critics agree that some of his best collaborations are the ones written with his wife marcia muller shortshort stories which often depend on an ironic punch line are notoriously tough to write words do not a book make demonstrates pronzinis craftsmanshipas well as his penchant for puns words do not a book make i went to the rear window lifted the shade and looked out then i pulled the shade down in a hurry and spun around to glare at herbie you fathead i yelled whats the matter boss the police station is across the street i know herbie said calmly you know well thats nice isnt it i waved my hand at the telephones the dope sheets the rolls of flash paper and the other stuff we had just unpacked wont the cops be ever so happy when they bust in here no long rides in the wagon just down the back stairs across the street and into a cell think of the time and expense well be saving the taxpayers you fathead they arent going to bust in here herbie said no huh herbie shook his head dont you see the setup is perfect it couldnt be any better all i see is a cold cell in that cop house over there didnt you ever read the purloined letter the which letter purloined herbie said the purloined letterby edgar allan poe yeah i said never heard of him what is he some handicapper for one of the eastern tracks he was a writer herbie said he died over a hundred years ago whats some croaked writer got to do with this im trying to tell you boss he wrote this story called the purloined lettersee and everybody in it is trying to find a letter that was supposed to have been swiped only nobody can find it you know why i shrugged why because it was under their noses all the time i dont get it everybodys looking for the letter to be hidden some place herbie said so they never think to look in the only place leftthe most obvious place right in front of them so herbie sighed we got the same type of thing right here if the cops get wind a new bookie joint has opened up in town theyll look for it everywhere except under their noses everywhere except right across the street i thought about it i dont know i said it sounds crazy sure herbie said thats the beauty of it its so crazy its perfect it cant miss whatd you tell the guy you rented this place from i said we were manufacturers representatives for industrial valves no warehouse stock just a sales office i even had some sign painters put a phoney name on the windows front and back this landlord i said any chance of him coming up here when we aint expecting him none as long as we pay the rent on time hes not that kind of guy whats downstairs insurance company no bother on that end either i did some more thinking herbie might be right i decided why would the cops think of looking out their front door for the new book in town no reason none at all okay i said we stay but you better be right dont worry herbie said i am all the contacts lined up i took care of everything before i called you boss i got eight guysfive bars a cigar store a billiards parlour and a lunchroom phone number only no address i nodded put the word out then were in business herbie smiled of making many books there is no end he said huh i read that somewhere once keep your mind off reading and on the book i said for some reason herbie thought that was funny at nine the next morning the first contact phoned in his bets the other seven followed at tenminute intervals just the way herbie had set it up from the size and number of the bets i figured this town was going to be a gold mine we split up the work herbie taking the calls and putting the bets down on the flash paper and me figuring odds and laying off some of the scratch with the big books in vegas and l a the flash paper is thin stuff like onionskin and the reason we use it is that in case of a raid you just touch a match to it and the whole roll goes up in nothing flat no evidence no conviction so there we were humming right along getting ready for the first races at santa anita and golden gate fields when somebody knocked on the door herbie and i looked at each other then i looked at my watch as if the watch could tell me who was knocking on the damn door it was ten fortyfive one hour and fifteen minutes after wed opened for business who can that be herbie said the landlord maybe i thought you said he wouldnt bother us two of the telephones began ringing at the same time i jumped muffle those things herbie hauled up both receivers said ring back into each one and put them down again there was another knock on the door louder this time we better answer it herbie said if its not the landlord maybe its the mailman yeah i said anyway its nothing to worry about i mean cops wouldnt knock would they i relaxed sure if it was the cops they would have come busting in already they wouldnt stand out there knocking i got up and went over to the door and cracked it open and the first thing i saw was a badgea big shiny badge pinned to the front of a blue uniform shirt my eyes moved upward to a neck a huge red neck and then on up to a huge red head with a blueandgold cap perched on top of it hello the head said i saw another blue uniform behind it arrgh i said im chief of police wiggins the head said and i i slammed the door cops i yelled the flash paperherbie the flash paper copshe yelled the door burst open my backside was in the way but not for long it felt like a bull had hit that door which in a manner of speaking was just what had happened i flew into the room collided with a chair and fell down on my head a booming voice said whats going on in and then well ill be damned cops herbie yelled watch it jed the booming voice boomed flash paper a blue uniform blurred past me as i struggled to my knees i saw the uniform brush herbie aside saw a hand sweep across the desk saw all the paper flutter to the floor intact bookies the blue uniform said amazed hoohaw the booming voice said hoohawhaw right across the street the blue uniform said still amazed i reached up and touched my head i could feel a lump sprouting there then i looked over at herbie who was now cowering in the grip of a long arm herbie i said i am going to kill you herbie right across the streetthe blue uniform said again shaking his head in wonder hoo hoo hoo so down the back stairs we went across the street we went into a cell we went fortunately for herbie it wasnt the same cell i sat on the hard cot the lump on my head seemed to be growing but it was nothing i told myself to the lump that would soon grow on herbies head a little while later the blue uniform came back and took me to the chiefs office he took one look at me and broke off into a fresh series of hoohoos and hoohaws i sat in a chair and glared at the wall the chief wiped his eyes with a handkerchief damnedest thing i ever heard of he said setting up a bookie joint within spitting distance of the police station i ground my teeth its one for the books thats what it is he said and commenced hoohawing again i ground my teeth some more when his latest spasm ended the chief said what could have possessed you son instead of answering i asked him can i have a couple of minutes alone with herbie what for then he nodded his big red head and grinned and said oh i get it his idea was it yeah his idea damnedest thing i ever heard of the chief said again it really is one for the all right i said look how did you find out anyway well to tell you the truth we didnt you didnt we had no idea what you fellas were doing over there until we busted in then why were you there business license you got to have one to operate a business in this town i didnt get it i dont get it i said saw some sign painters over there the other day the chief said painting the name of a valve company on the windows so new company setting up shop in town the chief said good for the growth of our fair city but like i said every business has got to have a license so i did some checking on account of it was a slow day and found out this valve company never applied for one technically they were breaking the law herbie i thought im going to break your head wasnt a big deal but still the laws the law so i figured to sort of welcome them officially and then bring up the matter of the license afterwards keep from ruffling feathers that way you always go calling in person for something like that why didnt you use the phone probably would have the chief said except for one thing i sighed whats that well son he said with more hoohaws lurking in his voice you were right across the street edward d hoch b edward d hoch began writing short stories while a highschool student in rochester new york kept at it as a student at the university of rochester persisted in the practice during a stint in the army and finallywhile working for an advertising agencysold the village of the dead to famous detective the year was hoch was twentyfive and his trouble selling his stories was behind him although his stories were selling well he continued to work in advertising and public relations not taking the plunge into fulltime writing until its ironic that the man who was to become such a prolific author of short stories should begin his career just as the great market for short fiction was in its death throes famous detective was one of the last of the scores of pulp magazines that had crowded the drugstore racks and newsstands for generations and had been the primary source of income for literally thousands of american writers the pulps began to die in the early s as television siphoned away their audience and the decline of the slick magazine marketsaturday evening post colliers and otherssoon followed despite this from to hoch published twentyfive more stories he wrote under a variety of pen names and was one of the many writers of the day who used the ellery queen pseudonym hoch is the ultimate writers writer he has written five novels sciencefiction fantasy and detective stories and nonfiction he is now near the mark in shortstory output he has produced whatever the market is buying but has made his name in the detective short story he prefers them he has said because he can do one in a week or two while a novel requires three months and i find myself losing interest about halfway through christmas is for cops comes as close to typifying hochs work as is possible for such a versatile writer it was written for the christmasstory market contrasting the good will of the season with the evil of murder it features captain leopold star performer in one of hochs series it focuses on a single idea and it follows the tenets of the classic tale of detection with the clues honestly presented and the crime solved by deduction christmas is for cops going to the christmas party captain fletcher asked from the doorway captain leopold glanced up from his eternally cluttered desk fletcher was now a lieutenant in the newly reorganised violent crimes division and they did not work together as closely as they once had ill be there leopold said in fact ive been invited to speak this news brought a grin to fletchers face nobody speaks at the christmas party captain they just drink well this year youre going to hear a speech and im going to give it lots of luck is your wife helping with the decorations again this year i suppose shell be around fletcher chuckled she doesnt trust me at any christmas party without her the annual detective bureau party was by tradition a stag affair but in recent years carol fletcher and some of the other wives had come down to eagles hall in the afternoon to trim the tree and hang the holly somehow these members of the unofficial decorations committee usually managed to stay on for the evenings festivities the party was the following evening and captain leopold was looking forward to it but he had one unpleasant task to perform first that afternoon feeling he could delay it no longer he summoned sergeant tommy gibson to his office and closed the door gibson was a tough cop of the old school a bleak and burly man whod campaigned actively for the lieutenancy which had finally been given to fletcher leopold had never liked gibson but until now hed managed to overlook the petty graft with which gibsons name was occasionally linked what seems to be the trouble captain gibson asked taking a seat you look unhappy i am unhappy gibson damned unhappy while you were working the assault and robbery detail i had no direct command over your activities but now that im in charge of a combined violent crimes division i feel i should take a greater interest in them he reached across his desk to pick up a folder i have a report here from the district attorneys office the report mentions you gibson and makes some very grave charges what kind of charges the sergeants tongue forked out to lick his dry lips that youve been accepting regular payments from a man named freese gibson went pale i dont know what youre talking about carl freese the man who runs the numbers racket in every factory in this city you know who he is and you know what hes done men whove opposed him or tried to report his operations to the police have been beaten and nearly killed i have a report here of a foreman at lecko industries when some of his men started losing a whole weeks pay in the numbers and other gambling controlled by freese he went to his supervisor and reported it that night on the way home his car was forced off the road and he was badly beaten so badly that he spent three weeks in the hospital you should be familiar with that case gibson because you investigated it just last summer i guess i remember it remember your report too you wrote it off as a routine robbery attempt despite the fact that no money was taken from the victim the victim reported it to the district attorneys office and theyve been investigating the whole matter of gambling in local industrial plants i have their report here i investigate a lot of cases captain i try to do the best job i can nuts leopold was on his feet angry now there was nothing that angered him more than a crooked cop look gibson the das office has all of freeses records they show payments of a week to you what in hell were you doing for a week unless you were covering up for them when they beat some poor guy senseless those records are wrong gibson said i didnt get any hundred bucks a week then how much did you get leopold towered over him in the chair and gibsons burly frame seemed to shrivel i think i want a lawyer he mumbled im suspending you from the force without pay effective at once thank god you dont have a wife and family to suffer through this tommy gibson sat silently for a moment staring at the floor then at last he looked up seeking leopolds eyes give me a chance captain i wasnt in this alone whats that supposed to mean i didnt get the whole hundred by myself i had to split it with one of the other menand hes the one who introduced me to freese in the first place theres someone else involved in this one of the detectives yes give me his name not yet gibson hesitated because you wouldnt believe it let me give you evidence what sort of evidence he and freese came to me at my apartment and told me the type of protection they needed that was the night we agreed on the amount of money to be paid each week i wasnt taking any chances captain so i dug out an old recording machine id bought after the war and rigged up a hidden microphone behind my sofa i got down every word they said when was this leopold asked more than a year ago and ive kept the recording of the conversation ever since whats it worth to me if i bring it in im not in a position to make deals gibson would the d a make one i could talk to him leopold replied cautiously lets hear what youve got first gibson nodded ill take the reel off my machine and bring it in to you tomorrow if youre kidding me gibson or stalling im not captain i swear i just dont want to take the whole rap myself ill give you twentyfour hours then the suspension goes into effect regardless thank you captain get the hell out of here now thank you captain he said again and merry christmas on the day of the christmas party activities around the detective bureau slacked off very little it was always pretty much business as usual until around four oclock when some of the men started drifting out exchanging friendly seasonal comments the party would really commence around five when the men on the day shift arrived at eagles hall and it continued until well past midnight enabling the evening men to join in after their tours of duty then there would be a buffet supper and lots of beer and even some group singing around the big christmas tree without the family attachments of fletcher and the other men leopold tended to look forward to the party in many years it was the main event of his otherwise lonely holiday season by four oclock he had heard nothing from sergeant tommy gibson with growing irritation he called fletcher into his office gibsons under your command now isnt he fletcher thats right captain whats he working on today fletchers face flushed unexpectedly well captain it seems where is he things were a bit slower than usual so i told him he could go over to eagles hall and help put up the tree for the party what fletcher shifted his feet uneasily i know captain but usually i help carol and the other wives get it up now that im a lieutenant i didnt feel i could take the time off so i sent gibson in my place leopold sighed and stood up all right fletcher lets get over there right away why whats up ill tell you on the way eagles hall was a large reasonably modern building that was rented out for wedding receptions and private parties by a local fraternal group the detective bureau through its benevolent association had held a christmas party there for the past five seasons and its central location had helped make it a popular choice it was close enough to attract some of the uniformed force as well as the detective squad all were invited and most came at some time during the long evening now before five oclock a handful of plainclothesmen from various divisions had already arrived leopold waved to sergeant riker of the vice squad who was helping carol fletcher light her cigarette with a balky lighter then he stopped to exchange a few words with lieutenant williams a bony young man who headed up the narcotics squad williams had made his reputation during a single year on the force masquerading as a hippie musician to penetrate a group selling drugs to high school students leopold liked him liked his honesty and friendliness i hear youre giving a little speech tonight williams said pouring him a glass of beer herb clarke roped me into it leopold answered with a chuckle id better do it early before you guys get too beered up to listen he glanced around the big hall taking in the twentyfoot christmas tree with its lights and tinsel three guy wires held it firmly in place next to an old upright piano see tommy gibson around williams stood on tiptoe to see over the heads of some newly arrived uniformed men i think hes helping carol finish up the decorations thanks leopold took his beer and drifted over to the far end of the room carol had put down her cigarette long enough to tug at one of the wires holding the tree in place leopold helped her tighten it and then stepped back she was a charming intelligent woman and this was not the first time hed envied fletcher as wife and mother shed given him a fine home life im surprised to see you here so early captain he helped her secure another of the wires and said im always on time to help charming wives with christmas trees and thank you for sergeant gibson too he was a great help with the tree ill bet where is he now he took the hammer and things into the kitchen i think hes pouring beer now she produced another cigarette and searched her purse finally she asked do you have a light he lit it for her you smoke too much nervous energy do you like our tree fine just like christmas do you know somewhere in chesterton theres mention of a tree that devours birds nesting in its branches and when spring comes the tree grows feathers instead of leaves you read too much carol she smiled up at him the nights are lonely being a detectives wife the smile was just a bit forced she didnt always approve of her husbands work he left her by the tree and went in search of gibson the burly sergeant was in the kitchen filling pitchers of beer he looked up surprised as leopold entered hello captain i thought we had an appointment for today i didnt forget fletcher wanted me over here wheres the evidence you mentioned what leopold was growing impatient come on damn it tommy gibson glanced out at the growing crowd ive got it but i had to hide it hes here who the man whos in this with you yes im afraid freese might have tipped him off about the d as investigation leopold had never seen this side of gibsona lonely trapped man who was actually afraid or else was an awfully good actor ive given you your twentyfour hours gibson either produce this recording youve got or captain a voice interrupted were ready for your speech leopold turned to see sergeant turner of missing persons standing in the doorway ill be right there jim turner seemed to linger just a bit too long before he turned and walked away leopold looked back at gibson that him i cant talk now captain whered you hide it over by the tree its safe stick around till after my talk then well get to the bottom of this thing leopold left him pouring another pitcher of beer and walked out through the crowd with the end of the afternoon shifts the place had filled rapidly there were perhaps sixty members of the force present already about evenly divided between detectives and uniformed patrolmen several shook his hand or patted him on the back as he made his way to the dais next to the tree herb clarke president of the detective bureau benevolent association was already on the platform holding up his hands for silence he shook leopolds hand and then turned to his audience gather around now men the beerll still be there in five minutes you all know were not much for speeches at these christmas parties but i thought it might be well this year to hear a few words from a man we all know and admire leopold has been in the detective bureau for as long as most of us can remember the laughter caused him to add quickly though of course hes still a young man but this year in addition to his duties as captain of homicide hes taken on a whole new set of responsibilities hes now head of the entire violent crimes division of the bureau a position that places him in more direct contact with us all im going to ask him to say just a few words and then well have some caroling around the piano leopold stepped over to the microphone adjusting it upward from the position herb clarke had used then he looked out at the sea of familiar faces carol fletcher and the other wives hovered in the rear out of the way while their husbands and the others crowded around fletcher himself stood with sergeant riker an old friend and leopold noticed that lieutenant williams had moved over near tommy gibson he couldnt see jim turner at the moment men im going to make this worth listening to for all that you hear a lot at this time of the year about christmas being the season for kids but i want to add something to that christmas is for kids surebut christmas is for cops too know what i mean by that ill tell you christmas is perhaps the one time of the year when the cop on the beat or the detective on assignment has a chance to undo some of the ill will generated during the other eleven months this has been a bad year for cops around the countrymost years are bad ones it seems we take a hell of a lot of abuse some deserved but most of it not and this is the season to maybe right some of those wrongs dont be afraid to get out on a corner with the salvation army to ring a few bells or help some lady through a puddle of slush most of all dont be afraid to smile and talk to young people he paused and glanced down at tommy gibson there have always been some bad cops and i guess there always will be that just means the rest of us have to work a lot harder maybe we can just pretend the whole year is christmas and go about righting those wrongs anyway ive talked so long already ive grown a bit thirsty lets get back to the beer and the singing and make it good and loud leopold jumped off the platform and shook more hands hed meant to speak longer to give them something a bit meatier to chew on but far at the back of the crowd some of the younger cops were already growing restless and after all theyd come here to enjoy themselves not to listen to a lecture he couldnt really blame them herb clarke was gathering everyone around the piano for songs but leopold noticed that tommy gibson had suddenly disappeared the captain threaded his way through the crowd searching the familiar faces for the man he wanted great talk captain fletcher said coming up by his side did he tell you any more only that he had to hide the tape near the christmas tree he said the other guy was here who do you make it captain leopold bit his lower lip i make it that tommy gibson is one smart cookie i think hes playing for time maybe waiting for freese to get him off the hook somehow you dont think theres another crooked cop in the detective bureau i dont know fletcher i guess i dont want to think so the door to the mens room sprang open with a suddenness that surprised them both sergeant riker his usually placid face full of alarm stood motioning to them leopold quickly covered the ground to his side what is it riker in there my god captainin there its gibson what tommy gibson hes been stabbed i think hes dead leopold pushed past him into the tiled mens room with its scrubbed look and disinfectant odour tommy gibson was there all right crumpled between two of the wash basins his eyes glazed and open a long pair of scissors protruded from his chest lock all the outside doors fletcher leopold barked dont let anyone leave is he dead captain as dead as hell ever be what a mess you think one of our men did it who else call in and report it and get the squad on duty over here everyone else is a suspect he stood up from examining the body and turned to riker now tell me everything you know sergeant riker was a vice squad detective a middleaged man with a placid disposition and a friendly manner there were those who said he could even make a streetwalker like him while he was arresting her just now he looked sick and pale i walked in and there he was captain my god i couldnt believe my eyes at first i thought he was faking playing some sort of a trick notice anyone leaving before you went in no nobody but hes only been dead a few minutes that makes you a suspect sergeant rikers pale complexion seemed to shade into green at leopolds words you cant think i killed him he was a friend of mine why in hell would i kill tommy gibson well see leopold said motioning him out of the mens room the other detectives and officers were clustered around trying to see there was a low sombre hum of conversation all right everyone the captain ordered keep down at the other end of the room away from the tree thats right move away from it captain it was little herb clarke pushing his way through captain whats happened someone killed tommy gibson tommy one of us thats why nobody leaves here you cant be serious captain murder at the police christmas partythe newspapers will crucify us probably leopold pushed past him nobody enters the mens room he bellowed fletcher williamscome with me they were the only two lieutenants present and he had to trust them fletcher hed trust with his life he only hoped he could rely on williams too i cant believe it the bony young narcotics lieutenant said why would anyone kill tommy leopold cleared his throat ill tell you why though you may not want to believe it gibson was implicated in the district attorneys investigation of carl freeses gambling empire he had a tape recording of a conversation between freese himself and another detective apparently concerning bribery the other detective had a dandy motive for killing him did he say who it was williams asked no only that it was someone who got here fairly early today who was here before fletcher and i arrived williams creased his brow in thought riker was here and jim turner and a few uniformed men no just detectives well i guess riker and tuner were the only ones and herb clarke of course he was here all day with the ladies arranging for the food and the beer those three leopold mused and you of course lieutenant williams grinned yeah and me leopold turned toward the big christmas tree gibson told me he hid the tape recording near the tree start looking and dont miss anything it might even be in the branches the investigating officers were arriving now and leopold turned his attention to them there was something decidedly bizarre in the entire situation a fact which was emphasised as the doctor and morgue attendants and police photographers exchanged muted greetings with the milling party guests one of the young investigating detectives whod known tommy gibson turned pale at the sight of the body and had to go outside when the photographers had finished one of the morgue men started to lift the body he paused and called to leopold captain heres something a cigarette lighter on the floor under him leopold bent close to examine it without disturbing possible prints initials c f lieutenant williams had come in behind him standing at the door of the mens room carl freese he suggested leopold used a handkerchief to pick it up carefully by the corners are we supposed to believe that freese entered this place in the midst of sixty cops and killed gibson without anybody seeing him theres a window in the wall over there leopold walked to the frosted pane and examined it locked from the inside gibson might have been stabbed from outside but he couldnt have locked the window and gotten across this room without leaving a trail of blood fletcher had come in while they were talking no dice on that captain my wife just identified the scissors as a pair she was using earlier with the decorations its an inside job all right leopold showed the lighter c f could be carl freese fletcher frowned and licked his lips yeah he turned away nothing williams reported nothing in the tree it could be a fairly small reel nothing leopold sighed and motioned fletcher and williams to one side he didnt want the others to hear look i think gibson was probably lying too but hes dead and that very fact indicates he might have been telling the truth i have to figure all the angles now that you two have searched the tree i want you to go into the kitchen close the door and search each other carefully but williams began all right captain then line everybody up and do a search of them you know what youre looking fora reel of recording tape what about the wives captain get a matron down for them im sorry to have to do it but if that tape is here we have to find it he walked to the centre of the hall and stood looking at the tree lights and tinsel holiday wreaths and sprigs of mistletoe all the trappings he tried to imagine tommy gibson helping to decorate the place helping with the tree where would he have hidden the tape herb clarke came over and said theyre searching everybody yes im sorry to spoil the party this way but i guess it was spoiled for gibson already captain do you have to go on with this isnt one dishonest man in the bureau enough one is too many herb but the man were looking for is more than a dishonest cop now hes a murderer fletcher came over to them weve searched all the detectives captain theyre clean were working on the uniformed men now leopold grunted unhappily he was sure theyd find nothing suppose he said slowly suppose gibson unreeled the tape suppose he strung it on the tree like tinsel you see any brown tinsel hanging anywhere captain see any tinsel of any colour long enough to be a taped message no i dont leopold said two of the sergeants riker and turner came over to join them could he have done it to himself turner asked the word is you were going to link him with the freese investigation stabbing yourself in the chest with a pair of scissors isnt exactly common as a suicide method leopold pointed out besides it would be out of character for a man like gibson one of the investigating officers came over with the lighter only smudges on it captain nothing we could identify thanks leopold took it turning it over between his fingers c f carl freese he flicked the lever a couple of times but it didnt light finally on the fourth try a flame appeared all right he said quietly now he knew captain fletcher began damn it fletcher its your wifes lighter and you know it c f not carl freese but carol fletcher captain i fletcher stopped leopold felt suddenly very tired the coloured lights of the tree seemed to blur and he wished he was far away in a land where all cops were honest and everyone died of old age sergeant riker moved in captain are you trying to say that fletchers wife stabbed tommy gibson of course not riker that would have been quite a trick for her to follow him into the mens room unnoticed besides i had to give her a match at one point this evening because she didnt have this lighter then who when i first arrived you were helping carol fletcher with a balky lighter yes you riker you dropped it into your pocket unthinking and thats why she didnt have it later it fell out while you were struggling with gibson while you were killing him riker riker muttered a single obscenity and his hand went for the service revolver on his belt leopold had expected it he moved in fast and threw two quick punches one to the stomach and one to the jaw riker went down and it was over carol fletcher heard what had happened and she came over to leopold thanks for recovering my lighter she said i hope you didnt suspect me he shook his head eyeing fletcher of course not but i sure as hell wish your husband had told me it was yours i had to find out what it was doing there fletcher mumbled god its not every day your wifes lighter that you gave her two christmases ago turns up as a clue in a murder leopold handed it back to her maybe thisll teach you to stop smoking you knew it was riker anyway i was pretty sure with sixty men drinking beer all around here no murderer could take a chance of walking out of that mens room unseen his best bet was to pretend finding the body which is just what he did besides that of the four detectives on the scene early rikers vice squad position was the most logical for freeses bribery was there a tape recording fletcher asked leopold was staring at the christmas tree i think gibson was telling the truth on that one except that he never called it a tape i did that i jumped to a conclusion he simply told me it was an old machine purchased after the war in those early days tape recorders werent the only kind for a while wire recorders were almost as popular wire leopold nodded and started toward the christmas tree we know that gibson helped you put up the tree carol im betting that one of those wires holding it in place is none other than the recorded conversation of carl freese tommy gibson and sergeant riker linda barnes b before detroit native and longtime boston resident linda barnes created her semitough female private eye carlotta carlyle she worked as a theatre instructor and director in massachusetts high schools and wrote two oneact plays and four whodunits featuring the actorsleuth michael spraggue while her first four mysteries were successful it was the foot redhaired taxidriving carlyle who really put barnes on the map the spraggue books were written in the british tradition of the dilettante sleuth who has the money and thus the free time to help a group of friends who are being threatened or done in at a statistically improbable rate spraggue while identified with boston also travels to the california wine country in bitter finish and to new orleans in cities of the dead thereby indulging his creators passions for wine and cajun cooking respectively perhaps his most memorable boston appearance entails running down a killer during the boston marathon like the other spraggue books the action and solutions to the crimes depend more on the situation than on character carlyles first appearance in the short story lucky penny shows barnes utilising her theatre background in order to portray character through internal monologues and wisecracking dialogue it also sets the stage complete with boston backdrop for the six novels to date in which carlyle plays the lead among a cast of characters that includes her erstwhile colleague and wouldbe lover lieutenant mooney and gloria the wheelchairbound latenight taxi dispatcher like her colleagues in crime kinsey millhone and v i warshawski carlyle pursues personal relationships along with her cases and even when she doesnt know her clients and villains at the start of an adventure she often becomes intimately acquainted with themsometimes physicallybefore the solution is reached says barnes i am not carlotta even if we do share some characteristics we both play blues guitar when we need to think she plays better than i do but then i have much better taste in men lucky penny lieutenant mooney made me dish it all out for the record hes a good cop if such an animal exists we used to work the same shift before i decidedwronglythat there was room for a lady pi in this town who knows with this case under my belt maybe businessll take a degree spin and i can quit driving a hack see ive already written the official report for mooney and the cops but the kind of stuff they wanted date place and time cold as ice and submitted in triplicate doesnt even start to tell the tale so im doing it over again my way dont worry mooney im not gonna file this one the thayler case was still splattered across the front page of the boston globe id soaked it up with my midnight coffee and was puzzling it outmy cab on automatic pilot my mind on crimewhen the mad tea party began take your next right sister then pull over and douse the lights quick i heard the bastard all right but it must have taken me thirty seconds or so to react something hard rapped on the cabs dividing shield i didnt bother turning around i hate staring down gun barrels i said jimmy cagney right no your voice is too high let me guess dont tell me shut up kill the lights turn off the lights okay but douse the lights youve been tuning in too many old gangster flicks i hate a mouthy broad the guy snarled i kid you not broadi said christ broad you trying to grow hair on your balls look i mean it lady ladys better now you wanna vacate my cab and go rob a phone booth my heart was beating like a tin drum but i didnt let my voice shake and all the time i was gabbing at him i kept trying to catch his face in the mirror he must have been crouching way back on the passenger side i couldnt see a damn thing i want all your dough he said who can you trust this guy was a spiffy dresser charcoalgray threepiece suit and rep tie no less and picked up in front of the swank copley plaza i looked like i needed the bucks more than he did and im no charity case a woman can make good tips driving a hack in boston oh shes gotta take precautions all right when you cant smell a disaster fare from thirty feet its time to quit i pride myself on my judgment im careful i always know where the police checkpoints are so i can roll my cab past and flash the old lights if a guy starts acting up this dude fooled me cold i was ripped not only had i been conned i had a considerable wad to give away it was near the end of my shift and like i said i do all right ive got a lot of regulars once you see me you dont forget meor my cab its gorgeous part of my inheritance a chevy shiny as new kept on blocks in a heated garage by the proverbial dotty old lady its the pits of the design world glossy blue with those giant chromium fins restrained decor just the phone number and a few gilt curlicues on the door i was afraid all my old pals at the police department would pull me over for minor traffic violations if i went whole hog and painted carlottas cab in ornate script on the hood some do it anyway so where the hell were all the cops now where are they when you need em he told me to shove the cash through that little hole they leave for the passenger to pass the fare forward i told him he had it backwards he didnt laugh i shoved bills now the change the guy said can you imagine the nerve i must have cast my eyes up to heaven i do that a lot these days i mean it he rapped the plastic shield with the shiny barrel of his gun i checked it out this time funny how big a little looks when its pointed just right i fished in my pockets for change emptied them is that all you want the gold cap on my left front molar i said turn around the guy barked keep both hands on the steering wheel high i heard jingling then a quick intake of breath okay the crook said sounding happy as a clam im gonna take my leave good dont call this cab again listen the gun tapped you cool it here for ten minutes and i mean frozen dont twitch dont blow your nose then take off gee thanks thank youhe said politely the door slammed at times like that you just feel ridiculous you know the guy isnt going to hang around waiting to see whether youre big on insubordination but he might and who wants to tangle with a slug i rate pretty high in insubordination thats why i messed up as a cop i figured id give him two minutes to get lost meantime i listened not much traffic goes by those little streets on beacon hill at one oclock on a wednesday morn too residential so i could hear the guys footsteps tap along the pavement about ten steps back he stopped was he the one in a million whod wait to see if i turned around i heard a funny kind of whooshing noise not loud enough to make me jump and anything much louder than the ticking of my watch would have put me through the roof then the footsteps patted on straight back and out of hearing one minute more the only saving grace of the situation was the location district one thats mooneys district nice guy to talk to i took a deep breath hoping it would have an encore and pivoted quickly keeping my head low makes you feel stupid when you do that and theres no one around i got out and strolled to the corner stuck my head around a building kind of cautiously nothing of course i backtracked ten steps then whoosh along the sidewalk stood one of those new keep beacon hill beautiful trash cans the kind with the swinging lid i gave it a shove as i passed i could just as easily have kicked it i was in that kind of funk whoosh it said just as pretty as could be breaking into one of those trash cans is probably tougher than busting into your local bank vault since i didnt even have a dime left to fiddle the screws on the lid i was forced to deface city property i got the damn thing open and dumped the contents on somebodys front lawn smack in the middle of a circle of light from one of those snooty beacon hill gas streetlamps halfway through the whiskey bottles wadded napkins and beer cans i made my discovery i was doing a thorough search if youre going to stink like garbage anyway why leave anything untouched right so i was opening all the brown bagsyou know the good old brown lunchandbottle bagslooking for a clue my most valuable find so far had been the mouldy rind of a bologna sandwich then i hit it big one neatly creased bag stuffed full of cash to say i was stunned is to entirely underestimate how i felt as i crouched there kneedeep in garbage my jaw hanging wide i dont know what id expected to find maybe the guys gloves or his hat if hed wanted to get rid of it fast in order to melt back into anonymity i pawed through the rest of the debris my change was gone i was so befuddled i left the trash right on the front lawn theres probably still a warrant out for my arrest district one headquarters is off the beaten path over on new sudbury street i would have called first if id had a dime one of the few things id enjoyed about being a cop was gabbing with mooney i like driving a cab better but face it most of my fares arent scintillating conversationalists the red sox and the weather usually covers it talking to mooney was so much fun i wouldnt even consider dating him lots of guys are good at sex but conversationnow theres an art form mooney all sixfootfour linebacker pounds of him gave me the glad eye when i waltzed in he hasnt given up trying keeps telling me he talks even better in bed nice hat was all he said his big fingers pecking at the typewriter keys i took it off and shook out my hair i wear an old slouch cap when i drive to keep people from saying the inevitable one jerk even misquoted yeats at me only god my dear could love you for yourself alone and not your long red hair since im seated when i drive he missed the chance to ask me how the weather is up here im sixone in my stocking feet and skinny enough to make every inch count twice ive got a wide forehead green eyes and a pointy chin if you want to be nice about my nose you say its got character thirtys still hovering in my future its part of mooneys past i told him i had a robbery to report and his dark eyes steered me to a chair he leaned back and took a puff of one of his lowtar cigarettes he cant quite give em up but he feels guilty as hell about em when i got to the part about the bag in the trash mooney lost his sense of humour he crushed a halfsmoked butt in a crowded ashtray know why you never made it as a cop he said didnt brownnose enough you got no sense of proportion always going after crackpot stuff christ mooney arent you interested some guy heists a cab at gunpoint then tosses the money arent you the least bit intrigued im a cop ms carlyle ive got to be more than intrigued ive got murders bank robberies assaults well excuse me im just a poor citizen reporting a crime trying to help want to help carlotta go away he stared at the sheet of paper in the typewriter and lit another cigarette or dig me up something on the thayler case you working that sucker wish to hell i wasnt i could see his point its tough enough trying to solve any murder but when your victim is the jennifer mrs justin thayler wife of the famed harvard law prof and the society reporters are breathing down your neck along with the usual crimebeat scribblers you got a special kind of problem so who did it i asked mooney put his size twelves up on the desk colonel mustard in the library with the candlestick how the hell do i know some scumbag housebreaker the lady of the house interrupted his haul probably didnt mean to hit her that hard he must have freaked when he saw all the blood cause he left some of the ritziest stereo equipment this side of heaven plus enough silverware to blind your average hophead he snatched most of old man thaylers goddam idiot artworks collections collectibleswhatever the hell you call emwhich ought to set him up for the next few hundred years if hes smart enough to get rid of them alarm system yeah they had one looks like mrs thayler forgot to turn it on according to the maid she had a habit of forgetting just about anything after a martini or three think the maids in on it christ carlotta there you go again no witnesses no fingerprints servants asleep husband asleep weve got word out to all the fences here and in new york that we want this guy the pawnbrokers know the stuffs hot were checking out known art thieves and shady museums well dont let me keep you from your serious business i said getting up to go ill give you the collar when i find out who robbed my cab sure he said his fingers started playing with the typewriter again wanna bet on it bettings an old custom with mooney and me im not gonna take the few piddling bucks you earn with that ridiculous car right you are boy im gonna take the money the city pays you to be unimaginative fifty bucks i nail him within the week mooney hates to be called boy he hates to be called unimaginative i hate to hear my car called ridiculous we shook hands on the deal hard chinatowns about the only chunk of boston thats alive after midnight i headed over to yee hongs for a bowl of wonton soup the service was the usual lowkey slowmotion routine i used a newspaper as a shield if youre really involved in the wall street journal the casual male may think twice before deciding hes the answer to your prayers but i didnt read a single stock quote i tugged at strands of my hair a bad habit of mine why would somebody rob me and then toss the money away solution number one he didnt the trash bin was some mob drop and the money id found in the trash had absolutely nothing to do with the money filched from my cab except that it was the same amountand that was too big a coincidence for me to swallow two the cash id found was counterfeit and this was a clever way of getting it into circulation nah too baroque entirely how the hell would the guy know i was the pawingthroughthetrash type three it was a training session some fool had used me to perfect his robbery technique couldnt he learn from tv like the rest of the crooks four it was a frat hazing robbing a hack at gunpoint isnt exactly in the same league as swallowing goldfish i closed my eyes my face came to a fortunate halt about an inch above a bowl of steaming broth thats when i decided to pack it in and head for home wonton soup is lousy for the complexion i checked out the log i keep in the chevy totalled my fares missing all in change a very reasonable robbery by the time i got home the sleepiness had passed you know how it is one moment youre yawning the next your eyes wont close usually happens when my head hits the pillow this time i didnt even make it that far what woke me up was the idea that my robber hadnt meant to steal a thing maybe hed left me something instead you know something hot cleverly concealed something he could pick up in a few weeks after things cooled off i went over that backseat with a vengeance but i didnt find anything besides old kleenex and bent paperclips my brainstorm wasnt too clever after all i mean if the guy wanted to use my cab as a hiding place why advertise by pulling a fiveanddime robbery i sat in the drivers seat tugged my hair and stewed what did i have to go on the memory of a nervous thief who talked like a b movie and stole only change maybe a mad tollbooth collector i live in a cambridge dump in any other city i couldnt sell the damned thing if i wanted to here i turn real estate agents away daily the key to my homes value is the fact that i can hoof it to harvard square in five minutes its a sellers market for tarpaper shacks within walking distance of the square under a hundred thou only if the plumbings outside it took me a while to get in the door ive got about five locks on it neighbourhoods popular with thieves as well as gentry im neither i inherited the house from my weird aunt bea all paid for i consider the property taxes my rent and the rents getting steeper all the time i slammed my log down on the dining room table ive got rooms galore in that old house rent a couple of them to harvard students ive got my own office on the second floor but i do most of my work at the dining room table i like the view of the refrigerator i started over from square one i called gloria shes the latenight dispatcher for the independent taxi owners association ive never seen her but her voice is as smooth as mink oil and ill bet we get a lot of calls from guys who just want to hear her say shell pick em up in five minutes gloria its carlotta hi babe you been pretty popular today was i popular at onethirtyfive this morning huh i picked up a fare in front of the copley plaza at onethirtyfive did you hand that one out to all comers or did you give it to me solo just a sec i could hear her charming the pants off some caller in the background then she got back to me i just gave him to you babe he asked for the lady in the chevy not a lot of those on the road thanks gloria trouble she asked is mah middle name i twanged we both laughed and i hung up before she got a chance to crossexamine me so the robber wanted my cab i wished id concentrated on his face instead of his snazzy clothes maybe it was somebody i knew some jokester in midprank i killed that idea i dont know anybody whod pull a stunt like that at gunpoint and all i dont want to know anybody like that why rob my cab then toss the dough i pondered sudden religious conversion discarded it maybe my robber was some perpetual screwup whod ditched the cash by mistake or maybe he got exactly what he wanted maybe he desperately desired my change why because my change was special valuable beyond its replacement cost so how would somebody know my change was valuable because hed given it to me himself earlier in the day not bad i said out loud not bad it was the kind of reasoning theyd bounced me off the police force for what my socalled superiors termed the fevered product of an overimaginative mind i leapt at it because it was the only explanation i could think of i do like life to make some sort of sense i pored over my log i keep pretty good notes where i pick up a fare where i drop him whether hes a nailer or a radio call first i ruled out all the women that made the task slightly less impossible sixteen suspects down from thirtyfive then i yanked my hair and stared at the blank white porcelain of the refrigerator door got up and made myself a sandwich ham swiss cheese salami lettuce and tomato on rye ate it stared at the porcelain some more until the suspects started coming into focus five of the guys were just plain fat and one was decidedly on the hefty side id felt like telling them all to walk might do them some good might bring on a heart attack i crossed them all out making a thin person look plump is hard enough its damn near impossible to make a fatty look thin then i considered my regulars jonah ashley a tiny blond southern gent musclebound justcallmeharold at longfellow place dr homewood getting his daily ferry from beth israel to mgh marvin of the gay bars and professor dickerman harvards answer to berkeleys sixties radicals i crossed them all off i could see dickerman holding up the first filthy capitalist bank or disobeying civilly at seabrook even blowing up an oil company or two but my mind boggled at the thought of the great liberal dickerman robbing some poor cabbie it would be like robin hood joining the sheriff of nottingham on some particularly rotten peasant swindle then theyd both rape maid marian and go off pals together dickerman was a lousy tipper that ought to be a crime so what did i have eleven out of sixteen guys cleared without leaving my chair me and sherlock holmes the famous armchair detectives im stubborn that was one of my good cop traits i stared at that log till my eyes bugged out i remembered two of the five pretty easily they were handsome and im far from blind the first had one of those elegant bony faces and farapart eyes he was taller than my bandit id ceased eyeballing him when i noticed the ring on his left hand i never fuss with the married kind the other one was built a weight lifter not an arnold schwarzenegger extremist but built i think id have noticed that bod on my bandit like i said im not blind that left three okay i closed my eyes who had i picked up at the hyatt on memorial drive yeah that was the salesman guy the one who looked so uncomfortable that id figured hed been hoping to ask his cabbie for a few pointers concerning the best skirtchasing areas in our fair city too low a voice too broad in the beam the log said id picked up a hailer at kenmore square when id let out the salesman ah yes a talker the weather mostly dont you think its dangerous for you to be driving a cab yeah i remembered him all right a fatherly type clasping a briefcase heading to the financial district too old down to one i was exhausted but not the least bit sleepy all i had to do was remember who id picked up on beacon near charles a hailer before five oclock which was fine by me because i wanted to be long gone before rush hour gridlocked the city id gotten onto storrow and taken him along the river into newton center dropped him off at the bay bank middlesex right before closing time it was coming back little nervous guy pegged him as an accountant when id let him out at the bank measly undernourished soul skinny as a rail stooped with pits left from teenage acne shit i let my head sink down onto the dining room table when i realised what id done id ruled them all out every one so much for my brilliant deductive powers i retired to my bedroom disgusted not only had i lost in assorted alloy metals i was going to lose fifty dollars to mooney i stared at myself in the mirror but what i was really seeing was the round hole at the end of a held in a neat gloved hand somehow the gloves made me feel better id remembered another detail about my piggybank robber i consulted the mirror and kept the recall going a hat the guy wore a hat not like my cap but like a hat out of a forties gangster flick i had one of those im a sucker for hats i plunked it on my head jamming my hair up underneathand i drew in my breath sharply a shoulderpadded jacket a slim build a low slouched hat gloves boots with enough heel to click as he walked away voice high breathy almost whispered not unpleasant accentless no boston r i had a mans jacket and a couple of ties in my closet dont ask they may have dated from as far back as my exhusband but not necessarily so i slipped into the jacket knotted the tie tilted the hat down over one eye id have trouble pulling it off im skinny but my build is decidedly female still i wonderedenough to traipse back downstairs pull a chicken leg out of the fridge go back to the log and review the feminine possibilities good thing i did everything clicked one lady fit the bill exactly mannish walk and clothes tall for a woman and i was in luck while id picked her up in harvard square id dropped her at a real address a house in brookline mason terrace at the tope of corey hill jojos garage opens at seven that gave me a big two hours to sleep i took my beloved car in for some repair work it really didnt need yet and sweettalked jojo into giving me a leaner i needed a hack but not mine only trouble with that chevy is its too damn conspicuous i figured id lose way more than fifty bucks staking out mason terrace i also figured it would be worth it to see old mooneys face she was regular as clockwork a dream to tail eightthirtyseven every morning she got a ride to the square with a nextdoor neighbour took a cab home at fivefifteen a working woman well she couldnt make much of a living from robbing hacks and dumping the loot in the garbage i was damn curious by now i knew as soon as i looked her over that she was the one but she seemed so blah so normal she must have been fiveseven or eight but the way she stooped she didnt look tall her hair was long and brown with a lot of blond in it the kind of hair that would have been terrific loose and wild like a horses mane she tied it back with a scarf a brown scarf she wore suits brown suits she had a tiny nose brown eyes under pale eyebrows a sharp chin i never saw her smile maybe what she needed was a shrink not a session with mooney maybe shed done it for the excitement god knows if i had her routine her job id probably be dressing up like king kong and assaulting skyscrapers see i followed her to work it wasnt even tricky she trudged the same path went in the same entrance to harvard yard probably walked the same number of steps every morning her name was marcia heidegger and she was a secretary in the admissions office of the college of fine arts i got friendly with one of her coworkers there was this guy typing away like mad at a desk in her office i could just see him from the side window he had grad student written all over his face longish wispy hair goldrimmed glasses serious given to deep sighs and bright velour v necks probably writing his thesis on courtly love and the theories of chretien de troyes i latched onto him at baileys the day after id tracked lady heidegger to her harvard lair too bad roger was so short most short guys find it hard to believe that im really trying to pick them up they look for ulterior motives not the napoleon type of short guy he assumes ive been waiting years for a chance to dance with a guy who doesnt have to bend to stare down my cleavage but roger was no napoleon so i had to engineer things a little i got into line ahead of him and ordered after long deliberation a blt on toast while the guy made it up and shoved it on a plate with three measly potato chips and a sliver of pickle you could barely see i searched through my wallet opened my change purse counted out silver got to on the last five pennies the counterman sang out thatll be a buck eightyfive i pawed through my pockets found a nickel two pennies the line was growing restive i concentrated on looking like a damsel in need of a knight a tough task for a woman over six feet roger i didnt know he was roger then smiled ruefully and passed over a quarter i was effusive in my thanks i sat at a table for two and when hed gotten his tray hamandcheese and a strawberry ice cream soda i motioned him into my extra chair he was a sweetie sitting down he forgot the difference in our height and decided i might be someone he could talk to i encouraged him i hung shamelessly on his every word a harvard man imagine that we got around slowly ever so slowly to his work at the admissions office he wanted to duck it and talk about more important issues but i persisted id been thinking about getting a job at harvard possibly in admissions what kind of people did he work with were they congenial what was the atmosphere like was it a big office how many people men women any soulmates readers or just you know office people according to him every soul he worked with was brain dead i interrupted a stream of complaint with gee i know somebody who works for harvard i wonder if you know her its a big place he said hoping to avoid the whole endless business i met her at a party always meant to look her up i searched through my bag found a scrap of paper and pretended to read marcia heideggers name off it marcia geez i work with marcia same office do you think she likes her work i mean i got some strange vibes from her i said i actually said strange vibes and he didnt laugh his head off people in the square say things like that and other people take them seriously his face got conspiratorial of all things and he leaned closer to me you want it i bet you could get marcias job you mean it what a complimenta place for me among the brain dead shes gonna get fired if she doesnt snap out of it snap out of what it was bad enough working with her when she first came over shes one of those crazy neat people cant stand to see papers lying on a desktop you know she almost threw out the first chapter of my thesis i made a suitably horrified noise and he went on well you know about marcia its kind of tragic she doesnt talk about it but he was dying to yes i said as if he needed egging on he lowered his voice she used to work for justin thayler over at the law school that guy in the news whose wife got killed you know her work hasnt been worth shit since it happened shes always on the phone talking real soft hanging up if anybody comes in the room i mean youd think she was in love with the guy or something the way she i dont remember what i said for all i know i may have volunteered to type his thesis but i got rid of him somehow and then i scooted around the corner of church street and found a pay phone and dialled mooney dont tell me he said somebody mugged you but they only took your trading stamps i have just one question for you moon i accept a june wedding but ill have to break it to mother gently tell me what kind of junk justin thayler collected i could hear him breathing into the phone just tell me i said for curiositys sake you onto something carlotta im curious mooney and youre not the only source of information in the world thayler collected roman stuff antiques and i mean old artifacts statues coins whole mess of them thanks carlotta i never did find out what he was about to say because i hung up rude i know but i had things to do and it was better mooney shouldnt know what they were because they came under the heading of illegal activities when i knocked at the front door of the mason terrace house at am the next day i was dressed in dark slacks a white blouse and my old police department hat i looked very much like the guy who reads your gas meter ive never heard of anyone being arrested for impersonating the gasman ive never heard of anyone really giving the gasman a second look he fades into the background and thats exactly what i wanted to do i knew marcia heidegger wouldnt be home for hours old reliable had left for the square at her usual time precise to the minute but i wasnt percent sure marcia lived alone hence the gasman i could knock on the door and check it out those brookline neighbourhoods kill me act sneaky and the neighbours call the cops in twenty seconds but walk right up to the front door knock talk to yourself while youre sticking a shim in the crack of the door let yourself in and nobody does a thing boldness is all the place wasnt bad three rooms kitchen and bath light and airy marcia was incredibly organised obsessively neat which meant i had to keep track of where everything was and put it back just so there was no clutter in the womans life the smell of coffee and toast lingered but if shed eaten breakfast shed already washed dried and put away the dishes the morning paper had been read and tossed in the trash the mail was sorted in one of those plastic accordion files i mean she folded her underwear like origami now coins are hard to look for theyre small you can hide em anywhere so this search took me one hell of a long time nine out of ten women hide things that are dear to them in the bedroom they keep their finest jewellery closest to the bed sometimes in the nightstand sometimes right under the mattress thats where i started marcia had a jewellery box on top of her dresser i felt like hiding it for her she had some nice stuff and a burglar could have made quite a haul with no effort the next favourite place for women to stash valuables is the kitchen i sifted through her flour i removed every kelloggs rice krispy from the giant economysized boxand returned it i went through her place like no burglar ever will when i say thorough i mean thorough i found four odd things a neatly squared pile of clippings from the globe and the herald all the articles about the thayler killing a manila envelope containing five different safedepositbox keys a tupperware container full of superstitious junk good luck charms mostly the kind of stuff id never have associated with a straightarrow like marcia rabbits feet galore a little leather bag on a string that looked like some kind of voodoo charm a pendant in the shape of a cross surmounted by a hook and i swear to god a pack of worn tarot cards oh yes and a automatic looking a lot less threatening stuck in an ice cube tray i took the bullets the unloaded gun threatened a defenceless box of breyers mint chocolatechip ice cream i left everything else just the way id found it and went home and tugged my hair and stewed and brooded and ate half the stuff in the refrigerator i kid you not at about one in the morning it all made blinding crystalclear sense the next afternoon at fivefifteen i made sure i was the cabbie who picked up marcia heidegger in harvard square now cabstands have the most rigid protocol since queen victoria you do not grab a fare out of turn or your fellow cabbies are definitely not amused there was nothing for it but bribing the ranks this bet with mooney was costing me plenty i got her she swung open the door and gave the mason terrace number i grunted kept my face turned front and took off some people really watch where youre going in a cab scared to death youll take them a block out of their way and squeeze them for an extra nickel others just lean back and dream she was a dreamer thank god i was almost at district one headquarters before she woke up excuse me she said polite as ever thats mason terrace in brookline take the next right pull over and douse your lights i said in a low bogart voice my imitation was not that good but it got the point across her eyes widened and she made an instinctive grab for the door handle dont try it lady i bogied on you think im dumb enough to take you in alone theres a cop car behind us just waiting for you to make a move her hand froze she was a sap for movie dialogue wheres the cop was all she said on the way up to mooneys office what cop the one following us you have touching faith in our lawenforcement system i said she tried a bolt i kid you not ive had experience with runners a lot trickier than marcia i grabbed her in approved cop hold number three and marched her into mooneys office he actually stopped typing and raised an eyebrow an expression of great shock for mooney citizens arrest i said charges petty theft commission of a felony using a firearm i rattled off a few more charges using the numbers i remembered from cop school this woman is crazy marcia heidegger said with all the dignity she could muster search her i said get a matron in here i want my four dollars and eightytwo cents back mooney looked like he agreed with marcias opinion of my mental state he said wait up carlotta youd have to be able to identify that four dollars and eightytwo cents as yours can you do that quarters are quarters dimes are dimes one of the coins she took was quite unusual i said im sure id be able to identify it do you have any objection to displaying the change in your purse mooney said to marcia he got me mad the way he said it like he was humouring an idiot of course not old marcia said cool as a frozen daiquiri thats because shes stashed it somewhere else mooney i said patiently she used to keep it in her purse see but then she goofed she handed it over to a cabbie in her change she should have just let it go but she panicked because it was worth a pile and she was just babysitting it for someone else so when she got it back she hid it somewhere like in her shoe didnt you ever carry your lucky penny in your shoe no mooney said now miss heidegger i said clearly marcia heidegger she used to work at harvard law school i wanted to see if mooney picked up on it but he didnt he went on this can be taken care of with a minimum of fuss if youll agree to be searched by i want to see my lawyer she said for four dollars and eightytwo cents he said itll cost you more than that to get your lawyer up here do i get my phone call or not mooney shrugged wearily and wrote up the charge sheet called a cop to take her to the phone he got jo ann which was good under cover of our oldfriendlongtimenosee greetings i whispered in her ear youll find it fifty well spent i said to mooney when we were alone jo ann came back shoving marcia slightly ahead of her she plunked her prisoner down in one of mooneys hard wooden chairs and turned to me grinning from ear to ear got it i said good for you whats going on mooney said she got real clumsy on the way to the pay phone jo ann said practically fell on the floor got up with her right hand clenched tight when we got to the phone i offered to drop her dime for her she wanted to do it herself i insisted and she got clumsy again somehow this coin got kicked clear across the floor she held it up the coin could have been a dime except the colour was off warm rosy gold instead of dead silver how i missed it the first time around ill never know what the hell is that mooney said what kind of coins were in justin thaylers collection i asked roman marcia jumped out of the chair snapped her bag open and drew out her little i kid you not she was closest to mooney and she just stepped up to him and rested it above his left ear he swallowed didnt say a word i never realised how prominent his adams apple was jo ann froze hand on her holster good old reliable methodical marcia why i said to myself why pick today of all days to trot your gun out of the freezer did you read bad luck in your tarot cards then i had a truly rotten thought what if she had two guns what if the disarmed was still staring down the mint chocolatechip ice cream give it back marcia said she held out one hand made an impatient waving motion hey you dont need it marcia i said youve got plenty more in all those safe deposit boxes im going to count to five she began were you in on the murder from day one you know from the planning stages i asked i kept my voice low but it echoed off the walls of mooneys tiny office the hum of everyday activity kept going in the main room nobody noticed the little gun in the welldressed ladys hand or did you just do your beau a favour and hide the loot after he iced his wife in order to back up his burglary tale i mean if justin thayler really wanted to marry you there is such a thing as divorce or was old jennifer the one with the bucks i want that coin she said softly then i want the two of youshe motioned to jo ann and meto sit down facing that wall if you yell or do anything before im out of the building ill shoot this gentleman hes coming with me come on marcia i said put it down i mean look at you a week ago you just wanted thaylers coin back you didnt want to rob my cab right you just didnt know how else to get your good luck charm back with no questions asked you didnt do it for money right you did it for love you were so straight you threw away the cash now here you are with a gun pointed at a cop shut up i took a deep breath and said you havent got the style marcia your guns not even loaded mooney didnt relax a hair sometimes i think the guy hasnt ever believed a word ive said to him but marcia got shook she pulled the barrel away from mooneys skull and peered at it with a puzzled frown jo ann and i both tackled her before she got a chance to pull the trigger i twisted the gun out of her hand i was almost afraid to look inside mooney stared at me and i felt my mouth go dry and a trickle of sweat worm its way down my back i looked no bullets my heart stopped fibrillating and mooney actually cracked a smile in my direction so thats all i sure hope mooney will spread the word around that i helped him nail thayler and i think he will hes a fair kind of guy maybe itll get me a case or two driving a cab is hard on the backside you know sue grafton b in the evolution of american detective fiction the rise of the wellwrought believable female private eye may be the most important trend of the past twenty years there can be no doubt about sue graftons contribution to this development as the creator of kinsey millhone a selfconfident independent smart divorcee in her thirties whose outlook on life grafton says is patterned after her own after all grafton admits to having turned to mystery writing as a means of getting her aggressions out on the page at a particularly difficult time in her life millhones clientscalifornians who work for a livingand their problems are also realistic in her novels memorably titled after successive letters of the alphabet graftons sleuth deals with issues that have directly affected the authors own life for instance in d is for deadbeat grafton deals with alcoholism a problem that she knew firsthand as the daughter of two alcoholics grafton says that her family was classically dysfunctional but it was also a household that revered the written word graftons father was c f grafton a lawyer who wrote the classic courtroom novel beyond a reasonable doubt it has been said that graftons work takes that of ross macdonald into another dimension as did macdonald grafton lives in santa barbara california and in homage to macdonald grafton has kinsey millhone like lew archer reside in the fictional santa teresa grafton notes that the parker shotgun grew out of reading that a longdefunct firearms company had made only two copies of a particular model of which one had been lost i know nothing at all about guns but here was a chance to make the murder weapon also the motive grafton says the story displays another of the strengths that make her work notable the minor characters have personalities of their ownsomething difficult to accomplish in short fiction and while the reader is more likely to remember the grimness of this dysfunctional family than the detection involved the doer of the fatal deed is nicely concealed until the end the parker shotgun the christmas holidays had come and gone and the newyear was under way january in california is as good as it getscool clear and green with a sky the colour of wisteria and a surf that thunders like a volley of gunfire in a distant field my name is kinsey millhone im a private investigator licensed bonded insured white female age thirtytwo unmarried and physically fit that monday morning i was sitting in my office with my feet up wondering what life would bring when a woman walked in and tossed a photograph on my desk my introduction to the parker shotgun began with a graphic view of its apparent effect when fired at a formerly nicelooking man at close range his face was still largely intact but he had no use now for a pocket comb with effort i kept my expression neutral as i glanced up at her somebody killed my husband i can see that i said she snatched the picture back and stared at it as though she might have missed some telling detail her face suffused with pink and she blinked back tears jesus rudd was killed five months ago and the cops have done shit im so sick of getting the runaround i could scream she sat down abruptly and pressed a hand to her mouth trying to compose herself she was in her late twenties with a gaudy prettiness her hair was an odd shade of brown like cherry coke worn shoulder length and straight her eyes were large a lush mink brown her mouth was full her complexion was all warm tones tanned and clear she didnt seem to be wearing makeup but she was still as vivid as a magazine illustration a good fourcolour run on slick paper she was seven months pregnant by the look of her not voluminous yet but rotund when she was calmer she identified herself as lisa osterling thats a crime lab photo howd you come by it i said when the preliminaries were disposed of she fumbled in her handbag for a tissue and blew her nose i have my little ways she said morosely actually i know the photographer and i stole a print im going to have it blown up and hung on the wall just so i wont forget the police are hoping ill drop the whole thing but i got news for them her mouth was starting to tremble again and a tear splashed onto her skirt as though my ceiling had a leak whats the story i said the cops in this town are usually pretty good i got up and filled a paper cup with water from my sparkletts dispenser passing it over to her she murmured a thankyou and drank it down staring into the bottom of the cup as she spoke rudd was a cocaine dealer until a month or so before he died they havent said as much but i know theyve written him off as some kind of smalltime punk what do they care theyd like to think he was killed in a drug deala double cross or something like that he wasnt though hed given it all up because of this she glanced down at the swell of her belly she was wearing a kelly green tshirt with an arrow down the front the word oops was written across her breasts in machine embroidery whats your theory i asked already i was leaning toward the official police version of events drug dealing isnt synonymous with longevity theres too much money involved and too many amateurs getting into the act this was santa teresaninetyfive miles north of the big time in l a but there are still standards to maintain a shotgun blast is the underworld equivalent of a bad annual review i dont have a theory i just dont like theirs i want you to look into it so i can clear rudds name before the baby comes i shrugged ill do what i can but i cant guarantee the results how are you going to feel if the cops are right she stood up giving me a flat look i dont know why rudd died but it had nothing to do with drugs she said she opened her handbag and extracted a roll of bills the size of a wad of socks what do you charge thirty bucks an hour plus expenses she peeled off several hundreddollar bills and laid them on the desk i got out a contract my second encounter with the parker shotgun came in the form of a dealers appraisal slip that i discovered when i was nosing through rudd osterlings private possessions an hour later at the house the address shed given me was on the bluffs a residential area on the west side of town overlooking the pacific it should have been an elegant neighbourhood but the ocean generated too much fog and too much corrosive salt air the houses were small and had a temporary feel to them as though the occupants intended to move on when the month was up no one seemed to get around to painting the trim and the yards looked like they were kept by people who spent all day at the beach i followed her in my car reviewing the information shed given me as i urged my ancient vw up capilla hill and took a right on presipio the late rudd osterling had been in santa teresa since the sixties when he migrated to the west coast in search of sunshine good surf good dope and casual sex lisa told me hed lived in vans and communes working variously as a roofer tree trimmer bean picker fry cook and forklift operatornever with any noticeable ambition or success hed started dealing cocaine two years earlier apparently netting more money than he was accustomed to then hed met and married lisa and shed been determined to see him clean up his act according to her hed retired from the drug trade and was just in the process of setting himself up in a landscape maintenance business when someone blew the top of his head off i pulled into the driveway behind her glancing at the frame and stucco bungalow with its patchy grass and dilapidated fence it looked like one of those households where theres always something under construction probably without permits and not up to code in this case a foundation had been laid for an addition to the garage but the weeds were already growing up through cracks in the concrete a wooden outbuilding had been dismantled the old lumber tossed in an unsightly pile closer to the house there were stacks of cheap pecan wood panelling sunbleached in places and warped along one edge it was all hapless and depressing but she scarcely looked at it i followed her into the house we were just getting the house fixed up when he died she remarked when did you buy the place i was manufacturing small talk trying to cover my distaste at the sight of the old linoleum counter where a line of ants stretched from a crust of toast and jelly all the way out the back door we didnt really this was my mothers she and my stepdad moved back to the midwest last year what about rudd did he have any family out here theyre all in connecticut i think real ladidah his parents are dead and his sisters wouldnt even come out to the funeral did he have a lot of friends all cocaine dealers have friends enemies not that i ever heard about who was his supplier i dont know that no disputes suits pending quarrels with the neighbours family arguments about the inheritance she gave me a no on all four counts i had told her i wanted to go through his personal belongings so she showed me into the tiny back bedroom where hed set up a card table and some cardboard file boxes a real entrepreneur i began to search while she leaned against the doorframe watching i said tell me about what was going on the week he died i was sorting through cancelled checks in a nike shoe box most were written to the neighbourhood supermarket utilities telephone company she moved to the desk chair and sat down i cant tell you much because i was at work i do alterations and repairs at a dry cleaners up at presipio mall rudd would stop in now and then when he was out running around hed picked up a few jobs already but he really wasnt doing the gardening full time he was trying to get all his old business squared away some kid owed him money i remember that he sold cocaine on credit she shrugged maybe ii was grass or pills somehow the kid owed him a bundle thats all i know i dont suppose he kept any records unuhn it was all in his head he was too paranoid to put anything down in black and white the file boxes were jammed with old letters tax returns receipts it all looked like junk to me what about the day he was killed were you at work then she shook her head it was a saturday i was off work but id gone to the market i was out maybe an hour and a half and when i got home police cars were parked in front and the paramedics were here neighbours were standing out on the street she stopped talking and i was left to imagine the rest had he been expecting anyone if he was he never said anything to me he was in the garage doing i dont know what chauncey next door heard the shotgun go off but by the time he got here to investigate whoever did it was gone i got up and moved toward the hallway is this the bedroom down here right i havent gotten rid of his stuff yet i guess ill have to eventually im going to use his office for the nursery i moved into the master bedroom and went through his hanging clothes did the police find anything they didnt look well one guy came through and poked around some about five minutes worth i began to check through the drawers she indicated were his nothing remarkable came to light on top of the chest was one of those brass and walnut caddies where rudd apparently kept his watch keys loose change almost idly i picked it up under it there was a folded slip of paper it was a partially completed appraisal form from a gun shop out in colgate a township to the north of us whats a parker i said when id glanced at it she peered over the slip oh thats probably the appraisal on the shotgun he got the one he was killed with well i dont know they never found the weapon but the homicide detective said they couldnt run it through ballistics anywayor whatever it is they do whyd he have it appraised in the first place he was taking it in trade for a big drug debt and he needed to know if it was worth it was this the kid you mentioned before or someone else the same one i think at first rudd intended to turn around and sell the gun but then he found out it was a collectors item so he decided to keep it the gun dealer called a couple of times after rudd died but it was gone by then and you told the cops all this stuff sure they couldnt have cared less i doubted that but i tucked the slip in my pocket anyway id check it out and then talk to dolan in homicide the gun shop was located on a narrow side street in colgate just off the main thoroughfare colgate looks like its made up of hardware stores uhaul rentals and plant nurseries places that seem to have half their merchandise outside surrounded by chainlink fence the gun shop had been set up in someones front parlour in a dinky white frame house there were some glass counters filled with gun paraphernalia but no guns in sight the man who came out of the back room was in his fifties with a narrow face and graying hair gray eyes made luminous by rimless glasses he wore a dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a long gray apron tied around his waist he had perfect teeth but when he talked i could see the rim of pink where his upper plate was fit and it spoiled the effect still i had to give him credit for a certain level of good looks maybe a seven on a scale of ten not bad for a man his age yes maam he said he had a trace of an accent virginia i thought are you avery lamb thats right what can i help you with im not sure im wondering what you can tell me about this appraisal you did i handed him the slip he glanced down and then looked up at me where did you get this rudd osterlings widow i said she told me she didnt have the gun thats right his manner was a combination of confusion and wariness whats your connection to the matter i took out a business card and gave it to him she hired me to look into rudds death i thought the shotgun might be relevant since he was killed with one he shook his head i dont know whats going on this is the second time its disappeared meaning what some woman brought it in to have it appraised back in june i made an offer on it then but before we could work out a deal she claimed the gun was stolen i take it you had some doubts about that sure i did i dont think she ever filed a police report and i suspect she knew damn well who took it but didnt intend to pursue it next thing i knew this osterling fellow brought the same gun in it had a beavertail foreend and an english grip there was no mistaking it wasnt that a bit of a coincidence his bringing the gun in to you not really im one of the few master gunsmiths in this area all he had to do was ask around the same way she did did you tell her the gun had showed up he shrugged with his mouth and a lift of his brows before i could talk to her he was dead and the parker was gone again i checked the date on the slip that was in august thats right and i havent seen the gun since did he tell you how he acquired it said he took it in trade i told him this other woman showed up with it first but he didnt seem to care about that how much was the parker worth he hesitated weighing his words i offered him six thousand but whats its value out in the marketplace depends on what people are willing to pay i tried to control the little surge of impatience he had sparked i could tell hed jumped into his crafty negotiators mode unwilling to tip his hand in case the gun showed up and he could nick it off cheap look i said im asking you in confidence this wont go any further unless it becomes a police matter and then neither one of us will have a choice right now the guns missing anyway so what difference does it make he didnt seem entirely convinced but he got my point he cleared his throat with obvious embarrassment ninetysix i stared at him thousand dollars he nodded jesus thats a lot for a gun isnt it his voice dropped ms millhone that gun is priceless its an al special gauge with a twobarrel set there were only two of them made but why so much for one thing the parkers a beautifully crafted shotgun there are different grades of course but this one was exceptional fine wood some of the most incredible scrollwork youll ever see parker had an italian working for him back then whod spend sometimes five thousand hours on the engraving alone the company went out of business around so there arent any more to be had you said there were two wheres the other one or would you know only what ive heard a dealer in ohio bought the one at auction a couple years back for ninetysix i understand some fella down in texas has it now part of a collection of parkers the gun rudd osterling brought in has been missing for years i dont think he knew what he had on his hands and you didnt tell him lamb shifted his gaze i told him enough he said carefully i cant help it if the man didnt do his homework howd you know it was the missing parker the serial number matched and so did everything else it wasnt a fake either i examined the gun under heavy magnification checking for fillin welds and traces of markings that might have been overstamped after i checked it out i showed it to a buddy of mine a big gun buff and he recognised it too who else knew about it besides you and this friend whoever rudd osterling got it from i guess ill want the womans name and address if youve still got it maybe she knows how the gun fell into rudds hands again he hesitated for a moment and then he shrugged i dont see why not he made a note on a piece of scratch paper and pushed it across the counter to me id like to know if the gun shows up he said sure as long as mrs osterling doesnt object i didnt have any questions for the moment i moved toward the door then glanced back at him how could rudd have sold the gun if it was stolen property wouldnt he have needed a bill of sale for it some proof of ownership avery lambs face was devoid of expression not necessarily if an avid collector got hold of that gun it would sink out of sight and thats the last youd ever see of it hed keep it in his basement and never show it to a soul itd be enough if he knew he had it you dont need a bill of sale for that i sat out in my car and made some notes while the information was fresh then i checked the address lamb had given me and i could feel the adrenaline stir it was right back in rudds neighbourhood the womans name was jackie barnett the address was two streets over from the osterling house and just about parallel a big corner lot planted with avocado trees and bracketed with palms the house itself was yellow stucco with flaking brown shutters and a yard that needed mowing the mailbox read squires but the house number seemed to match there was a basketball hoop nailed up above the twocar garage and a dismantled motorcycle in the driveway i parked my car and got out as i approached the house i saw an old man in a wheelchair planted in the side yard like a lawn ornament he was parchment pale with babyfine white hair and rheumy eyes the left half of his face had been disconnected by a stroke and his left arm and hand rested uselessly in his lap i caught sight of a woman peering through the window apparently drawn by the sound of my car door slamming shut i crossed the yard moving toward the front porch she opened the door before i had a chance to knock you must be kinsey millhone i just got off the phone with avery he said youd be stopping by that was quick i didnt realise hed be calling ahead saves me an explanation i take it youre jackie barnett thats right come in if you like i just have to check on him she said indicating the man in the yard your father she shot me a look husband she said i watched her cross the grass toward the old man grateful for a chance to recover from my gaffe i could see now that she was older than shed first appeared she must have been in her fiftiesat that stage where women wear too much makeup and dye their hair too bold a shade of blond she was buxom clearly overweight but lush in a seventeenthcentury painting shed have been depicted supine her plump naked body draped in sheer white standing over her something with a goats rear end would be poised for assault both would look coy but excited at the prospects the old man was beyond the pleasures of the flesh yet the noises he madegarbled and indistinguishable because of the strokehad the same intimate quality as sounds uttered in the throes of passion a disquieting effect i looked away from him thinking of avery lamb instead he hadnt actually told me the woman was a stranger to him but hed certainly implied as much i wondered now what their relationship consisted of jackie spoke to the old man briefly adjusting his lap robe then she came back and we went inside is your name barnett or squires i asked technically its squires but i still use barnett for the most part she said she seemed angry and i thought at first the rage was directed at me she caught my look im sorry she said but ive about had it with him have you ever dealt with a stroke victim i understand its difficult its impossible i know i sound hardhearted but he was always shorttempered and now hes frustrated on top of that selfcentered demanding nothing suits him nothing i put him out in the yard sometimes just so i wont have to fool with him have a seat hon i sat how long has he been sick he had the first stroke in june hes been in and out of the hospital ever since whats the story on the gun you took out to averys shop oh thats right he said you were looking into some fellows death he lived right here on the bluffs too didnt he over on whitmore that was terrible i read about it in the papers but i never did hear the end of it what went on i wasnt given the details i said briefly actually im trying to track down a shotgun that belonged to him avery lamb says it was the same gun you brought in she had automatically proceeded to get out two cups and saucers so her answer was delayed until shed poured coffee for us both she passed a cup over to me and then she sat down stirring milk into hers she glanced at me selfconsciously i just took that gun to spite him she said with a nod toward the yard ive been married to bill for six years and miserable for every one of them it was my own damn fault id been divorced for ages and i was doing fine but somehow when i hit fifty i got in a panic afraid of growing old alone i guess i ran into bill and he looked like a catch he was retired but he had loads of money or so he said he promised me the moon said wed travel said hed buy me clothes and a car and i dont know what all turns out hes a pennypinching miser with a mean mouth and a quick fist at least he cant do that anymore she paused to shake her head staring down at her coffee cup the gun was his well yes it was he has a collection of shotguns i swear he took better care of them than he did of me i just despise guns i was always after him to get rid of them makes me nervous to have them in the house anyway when he got sick it turned out he had insurance but it only paid eighty percent i was afraid his whole life savings would go up in smoke i figured hed go on for years using up all the money and then id be stuck with his debts when he died so i just picked up one of the guns and took it out to that gun place to sell i was going to buy me some clothes what made you change your mind well i didnt think itd be worth but eight or nine hundred dollars then avery said hed give me six thousand for it so i had to guess it was worth at least twice that i got nervous and thought i better put it back how soon after that did the gun disappear oh gee i dont know i didnt pay much attention until bill got out of the hospital the second time hes the one who noticed it was gone she said of course he raised pluperfect hell you should have seen him he had a conniption fit for two days and then he had another stroke and had to be hospitalized all over again served him right if you ask me at least i had labour day weekend to myself i needed it do you have any idea who might have taken the gun she gave me a long candid look her eyes were very blue and couldnt have appeared more guileless not the faintest i let her practice her wideeyed stare for a moment and then i laid out a little bait just to see what shed do god thats too bad i said im assuming you reported it to the police i could see her debate briefly before she replied yes or no check one well of course she said she was one of those liars who blush from lack of practice i kept my tone of voice mild what about the insurance did you put in a claim she looked at me blankly and i had the feeling id taken her by surprise on that one she said you know it never even occurred to me but of course he probably would have it insured wouldnt he sure if the guns worth that much what company is he with i dont remember offhand id have to look it up id do that if i were you i said you can file a claim and then all you have to do is give the agent the case number case number the police will give you that from their report she stirred restlessly glancing at her watch oh lordy im going to have to give him his medicine was there anything else you wanted to ask while you were here now that shed told me a fib or two she was anxious to get rid of me so she could assess the situation avery lamb had told me shed never reported it to the cops i wondered if shed call him up now to compare notes could i take a quick look at his collection i said getting up i suppose thatd be all right its in here she said she moved toward a small panelled den and i followed stepping around a suitcase near the door a rack of six guns was enclosed in a glassfronted cabinet all of them were beautifully engraved with fine wood stocks and i wondered how a priceless parker could really be distinguished both the cabinet and the rack were locked and there were no empty slots did he keep the parker in here she shook her head the parker had its own case she hauled out a handsome wood case from behind the couch and opened it for me demonstrating its emptiness as though she might be setting up a magic trick actually there was a set of barrels in the box but nothing else i glanced around there was a shotgun propped in one corner and i picked it up checking the manufacturers imprint on the frame l c smith too bad for a moment id thought it might be the missing parker im always hoping for the obvious i set the smith back in the corner with regret well i guess thatll do i said thanks for the coffee no trouble i wish i could be more help she started easing me toward the door i held out my hand nice meeting you i said thanks again for your time she gave my hand a perfunctory shake thats all right sorry im in such a rush but you know how it is when you have someone sick next thing i knew the door was closing at my back and i was heading toward my car wondering what she was up to id just reached the driveway when a white corvette came roaring down the street and rumbled into the drive the kid at the wheel flipped the ignition key and cantilevered himself up onto the seat top hi you know if my moms here who jackie sure i said taking a flyer you must be doug he looked puzzled no eric do i know you i shook my head im just a friend passing through he hopped out of the corvette i moved on toward my car keeping an eye on him as he headed toward the house he looked about seventeen blond blueeyed with good cheekbones a moody sensual mouth lean surfers body i pictured him in a few years hanging out in resort hotels picking up women three times his age hed do well so would they jackie had apparently heard him pull in and she came out onto the porch intercepting him with a quick look at me she put her arm through his and the two moved into the house i looked over at the old man he was making noises again plucking aimlessly at his bad hand with his good one i felt a mental jolt like an interior tremor shifting the ground under me i was beginning to get it i drove the two blocks to lisa osterlings she was in the backyard stretched out on a chaise in a sunsuit that made her belly look like a watermelon in a laundry bag her face and arms were rosy and her tanned legs glistened with tanning oil as i crossed the grass she raised a hand to her eyes shading her face from the winter sunlight so she could look at me i didnt expect to see you back so soon i have a question i said and then i need to use your phone did rudd know a kid named eric barnett im not sure whats he look like i gave her a quick rundown including a description of the white corvette i could see the recognition in her face as she sat up oh him sure he was over here two or three times a week i just never knew his name rudd said he lived around here somewhere and stopped by to borrow tools so he could work on his motorcycle is he the one who owed rudd the money well i dont know how were going to prove it but i suspect he was you think he killed him i cant answer that yet but im working on it is the phone in here i was moving toward the kitchen she struggled to her feet and followed me into the house there was a wall phone near the back door i tucked the receiver against my shoulder pulling the appraisal slip out of my pocket i dialled avery lambs gun shop the phone rang twice somebody picked up on the other end gun shop mr lamb this is orville lamb did you want me or my brother avery avery actually i have a quick question for him well he left a short while ago and im not sure when hell be back is it something i can help you with maybe so i said if you had a priceless shotgunsay an ithaca or a parker one of the classicswould you shoot a gun like that you could he said dubiously but it wouldnt be a good idea especially if it was in mint condition to begin with you wouldnt want to take a chance on lowering the value now if itd been in use previously i dont guess it would matter much but still i wouldnt advise itjust speaking for myself is this a gun of yours but id hung up lisa was right behind me her expression anxious ive got to go in a minute i said but heres what i think went on eric barnetts stepfather has a collection of fine shotguns one of which turns out to be very very valuable the old man was hospitalised and erics mother decided to hock one of the guns in order to do a little something for herself before hed blown every asset he had on his medical bills she had no idea the gun she chose was worth so much but the gun dealer recognised it as the find of a lifetime i dont know whether he told her that or not but when she realised it was more valuable than she thought she lost her nerve and put it back was that the same gun rudd took in trade exactly my guess is that she mentioned it to her son who saw a chance to square his drug debt he offered rudd the shotgun in trade and rudd decided hed better get the gun appraised so he took it out to the same place the gun dealer recognised it when he brought it in she stared at me rudd was killed over the gun itself wasnt he she said i think so yes it might have been an accident maybe there was a struggle and the gun went off she closed her eyes and nodded okay oh wow that feels better i can live with that her eyes came open and she smiled painfully now what i have one more hunch to check out and then i think well know whats what she reached over and squeezed my arm thanks yeah well its not over yet but were getting there when i got back to jackie barnetts the white corvette was still in the driveway but the old man in the wheelchair had apparently been moved into the house i knocked and after an interval eric opened the door his expression altering only slightly when he saw me i said hello again can i talk to your mom well not really shes gone right now did she and avery go off together who i smiled briefly you can drop the bullshit eric i saw the suitcase in the hall when i was here the first time are they gone for good or just for a quick jaunt they said theyd be back by the end of the week he mumbled it was clear he looked a lot slicker than he really was i almost felt bad that he was so far outclassed do you mind if i talk to your stepfather he flushed she doesnt want him upset i wont upset him he shifted uneasily trying to decide what to do with me i thought id help him out could i just make a suggestion here according to the california penal code grand theft is committed when the real or personal property taken is of a value exceeding two hundred dollars now that includes domestic fowl avocados olives citrus nuts and artichokes also shotguns and its punishable by imprisonment in the county jail or state prison for not more than one year i dont think youd care for it he stepped away from the door and let me in the old man was huddled in his wheelchair in the den the rheumy eyes came up to meet mine but there was no recognition in them or maybe there was recognition but no interest i hunkered beside his wheelchair is your hearing okay he began to pluck aimlessly at his pant leg with his good hand looking away from me ive seen dogs with the same expression when theyve done pottie on the rug and know youve got a roll of newspaper tucked behind your back want me to tell you what i think happened i didnt really need to wait he couldnt answer in any mode that i could interpret i think when you came home from the hospital the first time and found out the gun was gone the shit hit the fan you must have figured out that eric took it hed probably taken other things if hed been doing cocaine for long you probably hounded him until you found out what hed done with it and then you went over to rudds to get it maybe you took the l c smith with you the first time or maybe you came back for it when he refused to return the parker in either case you blew his head off and then came back across the yards and then you had another stroke i became aware of eric in the doorway behind me i glanced back at him you want to talk about this stuff i asked did he kill rudd i think so i said i stared at the old man his face had taken on a canny stubbornness and what was i going to do id have to talk to lieutenant dolan about the situation but the cops would probably never find any real proof and even if they did what could they do to him hed be lucky if he lived out the year rudd was a nice guy eric said god eric you all must have guessed what happened i said snappishly he had the good grace to colour up at that and then he left the room i stood up to save myself i couldnt work up any righteous anger at the pitiful remainder of a human being hunched in front of me i crossed to the gun cabinet the parker shotgun was in the rack three slots down looking like the other classic shotguns in the case the old man would die and jackie would inherit it from his estate then shed marry avery and theyd all have what they wanted i stood there for a moment and then i started looking through the desk drawers until i found the keys i unlocked the cabinet and then unlocked the rack i substituted the l c smith for the parker and then locked the whole business up again the old man was whimpering but he never looked at me and eric was nowhere in sight when i left the last i saw of the parker shotgun lisa osterling was holding it somewhat awkwardly across her bulky midriff id talk to lieutenant dolan all right but i wasnt going to tell him everything sometimes justice is served in other ways tony hillerman b tony hillermans procedurals featuring the navajo tribal police officers joe leaphorn and jim chee represent all the strengths of the american regional mystery novel not only does hillerman open a vista of the southwestern landscape with which he is intimately acquainted but his work offers an understanding of native american culture hillerman was born in the dustbowl village of sacred heart oklahoma where he enjoyed a supportive family life and attended a boarding school for potawatomie indian girls by growing up with potawatomie and seminole friends and neighbours he learned he says that racial difference exists only in the bigots imagination but that cultural differences are fascinating hillermans youthful hopes of becoming a chemical engineer were already dimmed by bad grades in math and chemistry courses when he was drafted to fight in world war ii in the infantry he twice attained the rank of private first class and won the silver star and the bronze star with cluster he also suffered a wound that left him with only one good eye and a need for a job outside a chemistry lab while he was home from europe on a convalescent furlough two crucial incidents occurred a reporter who had read his letters to his family told him that he should be a writer and while driving a truck to the navajo reservation he witnessed a curing ceremony that later became the center of the blessing way his first novel introducing leaphorn before he wrote that novel hillerman studied journalism at the university of oklahoma persuaded marie unzne to marry him and spent seventeen years as a journalist and another five years as a journalism professor at the university of new mexico after writing his second novel which features a political reporter as its sleuth hillerman returned to leaphorn sending him to the nearby zuni reservation to help find a navajo boy suspected of murder this book the dance hall of the dead won the best novel edgar award from the mystery writers of america the series of novels that followed feature either leaphom or jim chee a younger more traditional navajo police officer in the most recent five books the two work in uneasy tandem solving crimes through their knowledge of the culture of their people hillermans books have won awards from the navajos the centre for the american indian the american anthropological association and the department of the interior his colleagues in the mystery writers of america named him a grand master with its background of witchcraft and atmosphere of an impending desert storm chees witch demonstrates how hillerman makes tribal culture and the desert landscape germane to his plots in his tale the unravelling of a contemporary crime is impossible without an intimate knowledge of timeless ritual chees witch snow is so important to the eskimos they have nine nouns to describe its variations corporal jimmy chee of the navajo tribal police had heard that as an anthropology student at the university of new mexico he remembered it now because he was thinking of all the words you need in navajo to account for the many forms of witchcraft the word old woman tso had used was antil which is the ultimate sort the absolute worst and so in fact was the deed which seemed to have been done murder apparently mutilation certainly if old woman tso had her facts right and then if one believed all the mythology of witchery told among the fifty clans who comprised the people there must also be cannibalism incest even necrophilia on the radio in chees pickup truck the voice of the young navajo reading a gallup usedcar commercial was replaced by willie nelson singing of trouble and a worried mind the ballad fit chees mood he was tired he was thirsty he was sticky with sweat he was worried his pickup jolted along the ruts in a windless heat leaving a white fog of dust to mark its winding passage across the rainbow plateau the truck was gray with it so was jimmy chee since sunrise he had covered maybe two hundred miles of halfgraded gravel and unmarked wagon tracks of the arizonautahnew mexico border country routine at firsta check into a witch story at the tsossie hogan north of teec nos pos to stop trouble before it started routine and logical a bitter winter a sand storm spring a summer of rainless desiccating heat hopes dying things going wrong anger growing and then the witch gossip the logical a bitter winter a sand storm spring a summer awry the trouble at the summer hogan of the tsossies was a sick child and a water well that had turned alkalinenothing unexpected but you didnt expect such a specific witch the skinwalker the tsossies agreed was the city navajo the man who had come to live in one of the government houses at kayenta why the city navajo because everybody knew he was a witch where had they heard that the first time the people who came to the trading post at mexican water said it and so chee had driven westward over tohache wash past red mesa and rabbit ears to mexican water he had spent hours on the shady porch giving those who came to buy and to fill their water barrels and to visit a chance to know who he was until finally they might risk talking about witchcraft to a stranger they were mud clan and many goats people and standing rock clanforeign to chees own slow talking peoplebut finally some of them talked a little a witch was at work on the rainbow plateau adeline etcittys mare had foaled a twoheaded colt hosteen musket had seen the witch hed seen a man walk into a grove of cottonwoods but when he got there an owl flew away rudolph bistis boys lost three rams while driving their flocks up into the chuska high pastures and when they found the bodies the huge tracks of a werewolf were all around them the daughter of rosemary nashibitti had seen a big dog bothering her horses and had shot at it with her and the dog had turned into a man wearing a wolfskin and had fled half running half flying the old man they called afraid of his horses had heard the sound of the witch on the roof of his winter hogan and saw the dirt falling through the smoke hole as the skinwalker tried to throw in his corpse powder the next morning the old man had followed the tracks of the navajo wolf for a mile hoping to kill him but the tracks had faded away there was nothing very unusual in the stories except their number and the recurring hints that the city navajo was the witch but then came what chee hadnt expected the witch had killed a man the police dispatcher at window rock had been interrupting willie nelson with an occasional blurted message now she spoke directly to chee he acknowledged she asked his location about fifteen miles south of dennehotso chee said homeward bound for tuba city dirty thirsty hungry and tired i have a message tuba city chee repeated which i hope to reach in about two hours just in time to avoid running up a lot of overtime for which i never get paid the message is fbi agent wells needs to contact you can you make a meeting at kayenta holiday inn at eight p m whats it about chee asked the dispatchers name was virgie endecheenie and she had a very pretty voice and the first time chee had met her at the window rock headquarters of the navajo tribal police he had been instantly smitten unfortunately virgie was a borninto salt cedar clan which was the clan of chees father which put an instant end to that even thinking about it would violate the complex incest taboo of the navajos nothing on what its about virgie said her voice strictly business it just says confirm meeting time and place with chee or obtain alternate time any first name on wells chee asked the only fbi wells he knew was jake wells he hoped it wouldnt be jake negative on the first name virgie said all right chee said ill be there the road tilted downward now into the vast barrens of erosion which the navajos call beautiful valley far to the west the edge of the sun dipped behind a cloudone of the line of thunderheads forming in the evening heat over the san francisco peaks and the cococino rim the hopis had been holding their niman kachina dances calling the clouds to come and bless them chee reached kayenta just a little late it was early twilight and the clouds had risen black against the sunset the breeze brought the faint smells that rising humidity carries across desert countrythe perfume of sage creosote brush and dust the desk clerk said that wells was in room and the first name was jake chee no longer cared jake wells was abrasive but he was also smart he had the best record in the special fbi academy class chee had attended a quick tough intelligence chee could tolerate the mans personality for a while to learn what wells could make of his witchcraft puzzle its unlocked wells said come on in he was propped against the padded headboard of the bed shirt off shoes on glass in hand he glanced at chee and then back at the television set he was as tall as chee remembered and the eyes were just as blue he waved the glass at chee without looking away from the set mix yourself one he said nodding toward a bottle beside the sink in the dressing alcove how you doing jake chee asked now the blue eyes reexamined chee the question in them abruptly went away yeah wells said you were the one at the academy he eased himself on his left elbow and extended a hand jake wells he said chee shook the hand chee he said wells shifted his weight again and handed chee his glass pour me a little more while youre at it he said and turn down the sound chee turned down the sound about thirty percent booze wells demonstrated the proportion with his hands this is your district then youre in charge around kayenta window rock said i should talk to you they said you were out chasing around in the desert today what are you working on nothing much chee said he ran a glass of water drinking it thirstily his face in the mirror was dirtythe lines around mouth and eyes whitish with dust the sticker on the glass reminded guests that the laws of the navajo tribal council prohibited possession of alcoholic beverages on the reservation he refilled his own glass with water and mixed wellss drink as a matter of fact im working on a witchcraft case witchcraft wells laughed really he took the drink from chee and examined it how does it work spells and like that not exactly chee said it depends a few years ago a little girl got sick down near burnt water her dad killed three people with a shotgun he said they blew corpse powder on his daughter and made her sick wells was watching him the kind of crime where you have the insanity plea sometimes chee said whatever you have witch talk makes you nervous it happens more when you have a bad year like this you hear it and you try to find out whats starting it before things get worse so youre not really expecting to find a witch usually not chee said usually judge for yourself chee said ill tell you what ive picked up today you tell me what to make of it have time wells shrugged what i really want to talk about is a guy named simon begay he looked quizzically at chee you heard the name yes chee said well shit wells said you shouldnt have what do you know about him showed up maybe three months ago moved into one of those u s public health service houses over by the kayenta clinic stranger keeps to himself from off the reservation somewhere i figured you federals put him here to keep him out of sight wells frowned how long you known about him quite a while chee said hed known about begay within a week after his arrival hes a witness wells said they broke a cartheft operation in los angeles big deal national connections one of those where they have hired hands picking up expensive models and they drive em right on the ship and offload in south america this begay is one of the hired hands nobody much criminal record going all the way back to juvenile but all nickelanddime stuff i gather he saw some things that help tie some big boys into the crime so justice made a deal with him and they hide him out here until the trial something apparently showed in the tone of the question if you want to hide an apple you drop it in with the other apples wells said what better place chee had been looking at wellss shoes which were glossy with polish now he examined his own boots which were not but he was thinking of justice department stupidity the appearance of any new human in a country as empty as the navajo reservation provoked instant interest if the stranger was a navajo there were instant questions what was his clan who was his mother what was his fathers clan who were his relatives the city navajo had no answers to any of these crucial questions he was as chee had been repeatedly told unfriendly it was quickly guessed that he was a relocation navajo born to one of those hundreds of navajo families which the federal government had tried to reestablish forty years ago in chicago los angeles and other urban centers he was a stranger in a year of witches he would certainly be suspected chee sat looking at his boots wondering if that was the only basis for the charge that city navajo was a skinwalker or had someone seen something had someone seen the murder the thing about apples is they dont gossip chee said you hear gossip about begay wells was sitting up now his feet on the floor sure chee said i hear hes a witch wells produced a proforma chuckle tell me about it he said chee knew exactly how he wanted to tell it wells would have to wait awhile before he came to the part about begay the eskimos have nine nouns for snow chee began he told wells about the variety of witchcraft on the reservations and its environs about frenzy witchcraft used for sexual conquests of witchery distortions of curing ceremonials of the exotic twoheart witchcraft of the hope fog clan of the zuni sorcery fraternity of the navajo chindi which is more like a ghost than a witch and finally of the navajo wolf the antil witchcraft the werewolves who pervert every taboo of the navajo way and use corpse powder to kill their victims wells rattled the ice in his glass and glanced at his watch to get to the part about your begay chee said about two months ago we started picking up witch gossip nothing much and you expect it during a drought lately it got to be more than usual he described some of the tales and how uneasiness and dread had spread across the plateau he described what he had learned today the tsossies naming city navajo as the witch his trip to mexican water of learning there that the witch had killed a man they said it happened in the springcouple of months ago they told me the ones who knew about it were the tso outfit the talk of murder chee noticed had revived wellss interest i went up there he continued and found the old woman who runs the outfit emma tso she told me her soninlaw had been out looking for some sheep and smelled something and found the body under some chamiso brush in a dry wash a witch had killed him how chee cut off the question i asked her how he knew it was a witch killing she said the hands were stretched out like this chee extended his hands palms up they were flayed the skin was cut off the palms and fingers wells raised his eyebrows thats what the witch uses to make corpse powder chee explained they take the skin that has the whorls and ridges of the individual personalitythe skin from the palms and the finger pads and the soles of the feet they take that and the skin from the glans of the penis and the small bones where the neck joins the skull and they dry it and pulverize it and use it as poison youre going to get to begay any minute now wells said that right we got to him chee said hes the one they think is the witch hes the city navajo i thought you were going to say that wells said he rubbed the back of his hand across one blue eye city navajo is it that obvious yes chee said and then hes a stranger people suspect strangers were they coming around him accusing him any threats anything like that you think it wouldnt work that waynot unless somebody had someone in their family killed the way you deal with a witch is hire a singer and hold a special kind of curing ceremony that turns the witchcraft around and kills the witch wells made an impatient gesture whatever he said i think something has made this begay spooky he stared into his glass communing with the bourbon i dont know something unusual about the way hes acting hell of it is i dont know how he usually acts this wasnt my case the agent who worked him retired or some damn thing so i got stuck with being the delivery man he shifted his eyes from glass to chee but if it was me and i was holed up here waiting and the guy came along who was going to take me home again then id be glad to see him happy to have it over with all that he wasnt wells shook his head seemed edgy maybe thats natural though hes going to make trouble for some hard people id be nervous chee said i guess it doesnt matter much anyway wells said hes small potatoes the guy whos handling it now in the u s attorneys office said it must have been a tossup whether to fool with him at all he said the assistant who handled it decided to hide him out just to be on the safe side begay doesnt know much i guess not that and theyve got better witnesses so why worry wells laughed i bring this sucker back and they put him on the witness stand and he answers all the questions with i dont know and it makes the usda look like a horses ass when a u s attorney looks like that he finds an fbi agent to blame it on he yawned therefore he said through the yawn i want to ask you what you think this is your territory you are the officer in charge is it your opinion that someone got to my witness chee let the question hang he spent a fraction of a second reaching the answer which was they could have if they wanted to try then he thought about the real reason wells had kept him working late without a meal or a shower two sentences in wellss report one would note that the possibility the witness had been approached had been checked with local navajo police the next would report whatever chee said next wells would have followed federal rule oneprotect your ass chee shrugged you want to hear the rest of my witchcraft business wells put his drink on the lamp table and untied his shoe does it bear on this who knows anyway theres not much left ill let you decide the point is we had already picked up this corpse emma tsos soninlaw found somebody had reported it weeks ago it had been collected and taken in for an autopsy the word we got on the body was navajo male in his thirties probably no identification on him how was this bird killed no sign of foul play chee said by the time the body was brought in decay and the scavengers hadnt left a lot mostly bone and gristle i guess this was a long time after emma tsos soninlaw saw him so why do they think begay killed him wells removed his second shoe and headed for the bathroom chee picked up the telephone and dialled the kayenta clinic he got the night supervisor and waited while the supervisor dug out the file wells came out of the bathroom with his toothbrush chee covered the mouthpiece im having them read me the autopsy report chee explained wilson began brushing his teeth at the sink in the dressing alcove the voice of the night supervisor droned into chees ear that all chee asked nothing added on no identity yet still no cause thats him the voice said how about shoes chee asked he have shoes on just a sec the voice said yep size ten d and a hat and no mention of the neck or skull right i didnt miss that no bones missing silence nothing about neck or skull bones ah chee said fine i thank you he felt great he felt wonderful finally things had clicked into place the witch was exorcised jake he said let me tell you a little more about my witch case wells was rinsing his mouth he spit out the water and looked at chee amused i didnt think of this before wells said but you really dont have a witch problem if you leave that corpse a death by natural causes theres no case to work if you decide its a homicide you dont have jurisdiction anyway homicide on an indian reservation fbi has jurisdiction wells grinned well come in and find your witch for you chee looked at his boots which were still dusty his appetite had left him as it usually did an hour or so after he missed a meal he still hungered for a bath he picked up his hat and pushed himself to his feet ill go home now he said the only thing you dont know about the witch case is what i just got from the autopsy report the corpse had his shoes on and no bones were missing from the base of the skull chee opened the door and stood in it looking back wells was taking his pyjamas out of his suitcase so what advice do you have for me what can you tell me about my witch case to tell the absolute truth chee im not into witches wells said havent been since i was a boy but we dont really have a witch case now chee said he spoke earnestly the shoes were still on so the skin wasnt taken from the soles of his feet no bones missing from the neck you need those to make corpse powder wells was pulling his undershirt over his head chee hurried what we have now is another little puzzle chee said if youre not collecting stuff for corpse powder why cut the skin off this guys hands im going to take a shower wells said got to get my begay back to l a tomorrow outside the temperature had dropped the air moved softly from the west carrying the smell of rain over the utah border over the cococino rim over the rainbow plateau lightning flickered and glowed the storm had formed the storm was moving the sky was black with it chee stood in the darkness listening to the mutter of thunder inhaling the perfume exulting in it he climbed into the truck and started it how had they set it up and why perhaps the fbi agent who knew begay had been ready to retire perhaps an accident had been arranged getting rid of the assistant prosecutor who knew the witness would have been even simplera matter of hiring him away from the government job that left no one who knew this minor witness was not simon begay and who was he probably they had other navajos from the los angeles community stealing cars for them perhaps thats what had suggested the scheme to most white men all navajos looked pretty much alike just as in his first years at college all chee had seen in white men was pink skin freckles and lightcoloured eyes and what would the impostor say chee grinned hed say whatever was necessary to cast doubt on the prosecution to cast the fatal reasonable doubt to makeas wells had put itthe u s district attorney look like a horses ass chee drove into the rain twenty miles west of kayenta huge cold drops drummed on the pickup roof and turned the highway into a ribbon of water tomorrow the backcountry roads would be impassable as soon as they dried and the washouts had been repaired hed go back to the tsossie hogan and the tso place and to all the other places from which the word would quickly spread hed tell the people that the witch was in custody of the fbi and was gone forever from the rainbow plateau marcia muller b marcia muller has won her way into the record books of detective fiction as the creator of the first wellknown fully licensed totally believable hardboiled female private investigator while muller has used two other women sleuths both amateurs sharon mccone remains her bestknown creation muller was born in detroit and studied english and journalism at the university of michigan before moving to california where she worked on the staff of sunset magazine as an interviewer in san francisco for the university of michigan s institute of social research and as a partner in invisible ink a consulting service for writers although maxine ocallaghan introduced a female private eye delilah west in a short story mullers first mccone mystery edwin of the iron shoes published in is credited with establishing conventions for such characters that are still observed today muller provided her sleuth with a family of characters that includes professional associates at the all souls legal cooperative in san francisco she also endowed her with a sense of humour a mission to see justice prevail and a concern for the powerless many of mccones cases arise from problems faced by people whom she knows personally and they take place in notably realistic settings generally in california the verbal skillsin particular the interviewing expertisethat mccone employs are very significant to solving her cases making verbal acuity another strength emulated by later writers mullers two other series characters are elena oliverez curator at the museum of mexican arts in santa barbara and joanna stark who heads an art security firm the books in which these characters appear often focus on secrets of the past that affect the present in addition to producing fiction muller is an accomplished critic and anthologist having collaborated on a dozen books including three detective novels written with her husband bill pronzini in double for instance the story is told in alternating chapters from the points of view of mullers mccone and pronzinis detective nameless bennys space provides an excellent illustration of mullers technique mccones confident personality emerges the problem she confronts is contemporary the sociology of the neighbourhood is genuine the dialogue rings true and despite the brevity the form requires mullers quick sketches bring even the secondary characters so fully to life that the reader is truly moved by their circumstances bennys space amorfina angeles was terrified and i could fully empathise with her merely living in the neighbourhood would have terrified meall the more so had i been harassed by members of one of its many street gangs hers was a rundown side street in the extreme southeast of san francisco only blocks from the drug and crime infested sunnydale public housing projects there were bars over the windows and grilles on the doors of the small stucco houses dead and vandalised cars stood at the broken curbs in the weedchoked yard next door a mangy guard dog of indeterminate breed paced and snarled fear was written on this street as plainly as the graffiti on the walls and fences fear and hopelessness and a dull resignation to a life that none of its residents would willingly have opted to lead i watched mrs angeles as she crossed her tiny living room to the front window pulled the edge of the curtain aside a fraction and peered out at the street she was no more than five feet tall with rounded shoulders sallow skin and graying black hair that curled in short unruly ringlets her shapeless flowerprinted dress did little to conceal a body made soft and fleshy by bad food and too much childbearing although she was only forty she moved like a much older woman her attorney and my colleague jack stuart of all souls legal cooperative had given me a brief history of his client when hed asked me to undertake an investigation on her behalf she was a filipina who had emigrated to the states with her husband in search of their own piece of the good life that was reputed to be had here but as with many of their countrymen and women things hadnt worked out as the angeleses had envisioned first amorfinas husband had gone into the importexport business with a friend from manila the friend absconded two years later with joe angeless life savings then a year after that joe was killed in a freak accident at a construction site where he was working amorfina and their six children were left with no means of support and in the years since joes death their circumstances had gradually been reduced to this twobedroom rental cottage in one of the worst areas of the city mrs angeles jack told me had done the best she could for her family keeping them off the welfare rolls with a daytime job at a mission district sewing factory and nighttime work doing alterations as they grew older the children helped with parttime jobs now there were only two left at home sixteenyearold alex and fourteenyearold isabel it was typical of their mother jack said that in the current crisis she was more concerned for them than for herself she turned from the window now her face taut with fear deep lines bracketing her full lips i asked is someone out there she shook her head and walked wearily to the worn recliner opposite me i occupied the place of honour on a red brocade sofa encased in the same plastic that doubtless had protected it long ago upon delivery from the store i never see anybody she said not till its too late mrs angeles jack stuart told me about your problem but id like to hear it in your own wordsfrom the beginning if you would she nodded smoothing her bright dress over her plump thighs it goes back a long time to when benny crespo was they called him the prince of omega street you know hearing the name of her street spoken made me aware of its ironic appropriateness the last letter of the greek alphabet is symbolic of endings and for most of the people living here omega street was the end of a steady decline into poverty mrs angeles went on benny crespo was filipino his gang controlled the drugs here a lot of people looked up to him he had power and that dont happen much with our people once i caught alex and one of my older boys calling him a hero i let them have it pretty good you bet and there wasnt any more of that kind of talk around this house i got no use for the gangsfilipino or otherwise what was the name of benny crespos gang the kabalyeros thats tagalog for knights okaywhat happened to benny the house next door the one with the dogthat was where benny lived he always parked his fancy corvette out front and people knew better than to mess with it late one night he was getting out of the car and somebody shot him a drug burn they say after that the kabalyeros decided to make the parking space a shrine to benny they roped it off put flowers there every week on all saints day and the other fiestas it was something to see and that brings us to last march thirteenth i said mrs angeles bit her lower lip and smoothed her dress again when she didnt speak i prompted her youd just come home from work yeah it was late dark isabel wasnt here and i got worried i kept looking out the window like a mother does and you saw the guy who moved into the house next door after benny got shot reg dawson he was black one of a gang called the victors they say he moved into that house to show the kabalyeros that the victors were taking over their turf anyway he drives up and stops a little way down the block waits there revving his engine people start showing up the words been put out that somethings gonna go down and when theres a big crowd reg dawson guns his car and drives right into bennys space over the rope and the flowers well that started one hell of a fightvictors and kabalyeros and folks from the neighbourhood and while its going on reg dawson just stands there in bennys space acting macho thats when it happened what i saw and what was that she hesitated wet her lips the leader of the kabalyeros tommy dragonthe dragon they call himwas over by the fence in front of reg dawsons house where you couldnt see him unless you were really looking i was cause i was trying to see if isabel was anyplace out there and i saw tommy dragon point this gun at reg dawson and shoot him dead what did you do then ran and hid in the bathroom thats where i was when the cops came to the door somebodyd told them i was in the window when it all went down and then ran away when reg got shot well what was i supposed to do i got no use for the kabalyeros or the victors so i told the truth and now here i am in this mess mrs angeles had been slated to be the chief prosecution witness at tommy dragons trial this week but a month ago the threats had started anonymous letters and phone calls warning her against testifying as the trial date approached this had escalated into blatant intimidation a fire was set in her trash can someone shot out her kitchen window a dead dog turned up on her doorstep the previous friday isabel had been accosted on her way home from the bus stop by two masked men with guns and that had finally made mrs angeles capitulate in court yesterday shed refused to take the stand against dragon the state needed her testimony there were no other witnesses dragon insisted on his innocence and the murder gun had not been found the judge had tried to reason with mrs angeles then cited her for contemptreluctantly he said the court is aware that there have been threats made against you and your family he told her but it is unable to guarantee your protection then he gave her fortyeight hours to reconsider her decision as it turned out mrs angeles had a champion in her employer the owner of the sewing factory was unwilling to allow one of his longterm workers to go to jail or to risk her own and her familys safety he brought her to all souls where he held a membership in our legalservices plan and this morning jack stuart had asked me to do something for her what id asked what could i do that the sfpd couldnt to stop vicious harassment by a street gang well he said get proof against whoever was threatening her so they could be arrested and shed feel free to testify sure jack i said and exactly why hadnt the police been able to do anything about the situation his answer was not surprising lack of funds intimidation of prosecution witnesses in cases relating to gang violence was becoming more and more prevalent and open in san francisco but the city did not have the resources to protect them an old story nowadaysnot enough money to go around mrs angeles was watching my face her eyes tentative as i looked back at her her gaze began to waver shed experienced too much disappointment in her life to expect much in the way of help from me i said yes you certainly are in a mess lets see if we can get you out of it we talked for a while longer and i soon realised that amoras she asked me to call herheld the misconception that there was some way i could get the contempt citation dropped i asked her if shed known beforehand that a balky witness could be sent to jail she shook her head a person had a right to change her mind didnt she when i set her straight on that she seemed to lose interest in the conversation it was difficult to get her to focus long enough to compile a list of people i should talk with i settled for enough names to keep me occupied for the rest of the afternoon i was ready to leave when angry voices came from the front steps a young man and woman entered they stopped speaking when they saw the room was occupied but their faces remained set in lines of contention amor hastened to introduce them as her son and daughter alex and isabel to them she explained that i was a detective helping with the trouble with the judge alex a stocky youth with a tracery of moustache on his upper lip seemed disinterested he shrugged out of his high school letter jacket and vanished through a door to the rear of the house isabel studied me with frank curiosity she was a slender beauty with black hair that fell in soft curls to her shoulders her features had a delicacy lacking in those of her mother and brother unfortunately bright blue eyeshadow and garish orange lipstick detracted from her natural good looks and she wore an imitation leather outfit in a particularly gaudy shade of purple however she was polite and wellspoken as she questioned me about what i could do to help her mother then after a comment to amor about an assignment that was due the next day she left through the door her brother had used i turned to amor who was fingering the leaves of a philodendron plant that stood on a stand near the front window her posture was stiff and when i spoke to her she didnt meet my eyes now i was aware of a tension in her that hadnt been there before her children returned home anxiety because of the danger her witnessing the shooting had placed them in or something else it might have had to do with the quarrel theyd been having but werent arguments between siblings fairly common they certainly had been in my childhood home in san diego i told amor id be back to check on her in a couple of hours then after a few precautionary and probably unnecessary reminders about locking doors and staying clear of windows i went out into the chill november afternoon the first name on my list was madeline dawson the slain gang leaders widow i glanced at the house next door and saw with some relief that the guard dog no longer paced in its yard when i pushed through the gate in the chain link fence the creatures whereabouts quickly became apparent a bellowing emanated from the small shabby cottage i went up a broken walk bordered by weeds climbed the sagging front steps and pressed the bell a womans voice yelled for the dog to shut up then a door slammed somewhere within muffling the barking footsteps approached and the woman called yes who is it my names sharon mccone from all souls legal cooperative im investigating the threats your neighbour mrs angeles has been receiving a couple of locks turned and the door opened on its chain the face that peered out at me was very thin and pale with wisps of red hair straggling over the high forehead the dawson marriage had been an interracial one then the woman stared at me for a moment before she asked what threats you dont know that mrs angeles and her children have been threatened because shes to testify against the man who shot your husband she shook her head and stepped back shivering slightlywhether from the cold outside or the memory of the murder i couldnt tell i dont get out much these days may i come in talk with you about the shooting she shrugged unhooked the chain and opened the door i dont know what good it will do amors a damned fool for saying shed testify in the first place arent you glad she did the man killed your husband she shrugged again and motioned me into a living room the same size as that in the angeles house all resemblance stopped there however dirty glasses and dishes full ashtrays piles of newspapers and magazines covered every surface dust balls the size of rats lurked under the shabby danish modern furniture madeline dawson picked up a heap of tabloids from the couch and dumped it on the floor then indicated i should sit there and took a hassock for herself i said you are glad that mrs angeles was willing to testify arent you not particularly you dont care if your husbands killer is convicted or not reg was asking to be killed not that i wouldnt mind seeing the dragon get the gas chamberhe may not have killed reg but he killed plenty of other people what did you say i spoke sharply and madeline dawson blinked in surprise it made me pay closer attention to her eyes they were glassy their pupils dilated the woman i realised was high i said the dragon killed plenty of other people no about him not killing reg did i say that yes i cant imagine why i mean amor must know she was up there in the window watching for sweet isabel like always you dont sound as if you like isabel angeles im not fond of flips in general look at the way theyre taking over this area daly city s turning into another manila all they do is buy buy buyhouses cars stuff by the truckload you know theres a joke that the first three words their babies learn are mama papa and serramonte serramonte was a large shopping mall south of san francisco the roots of the resentment she voiced were clear to me one of our largest immigrant groups today the filipinos are highly westernised and by and large better educated and more affluent than other recently arrived asiansor many of their neighbours black or white isabel angeles for all her bright cheap clothing and excessive makeup had behind her a tradition of industriousness and upward mobility that might help her to secure a better place in the world than madeline dawson could aspire to i wasnt going to allow madelines biases to interfere with my line of questioning i said about dragon not having shot your husband hey who knows or cares the bastards dead and good riddance why good riddance the man was a pig a pusher who cheated and gouged peoplepeople like me who need the stuff to get through you think i was always like this lady no way i was a nice irish catholic girl from the avenues when reg got his hands on me turned me on to coke and a lot of other things when i was only thirteen liked his pussy young reg did but then i got oldim all of nineteen nowand i needed more and more stuff just to keep going and all of a sudden reg didnt even see me anymore yeah the man was a pig and im glad hes dead but you dont think dragon killed him she sighed in exasperation i dont know what i think its just that i always supposed that when reg got it it would be for something more personal than driving his car into a stupid shrine in a parking space you know what i mean but what does it matter who killed him anyway it matters to tommy dragon for one she dismissed the accused mans life with a flick of her hand like i said the dragons a killer he might as well die for regs murder as for any of the others in a way itd be the one good thing reg did for the world perhaps in a certain primitive sense she was right but her offhandedness made me uncomfortable i changed the subject about the threats to mrs angeleswhich of the kabalyeros would be behind them all of them the guys in the gangs they work together but i knew enough about the structure of street gangsmy degree in sociology from uc berkeley hadnt been totally worthlessto be reasonably sure that wasnt so there is usually one dominant personality supported by two or three lieutenants take away these leaders and the followers become ineffectual purposeless if i could turn up enough evidence against the leaders of the kabalyeros to have them arrested the harassment would stop i asked who took over the kabalyeros after dragon went to jail hector bulis it was a name that didnt appear on my list amor had claimed not to know who was the current head of the filipino gang where can i find him theres a fastfood joint over on geneva near the cow palace fat robbies thats where the kabalyeros hang out the second person id intended to talk with was the young man who had reportedly taken over the leadership of the victors after dawson s death jimmy willis willis could generally be found at a bowling alley also on geneva avenue near the cow palace i thanked madeline for taking the time to talk with me and headed for the daly city line the first of the two establishments that i spotted was fat robbies a cinderblockandglass relic of the early sixties whose specialties appeared to be burgers and chickeninabasket i turned into a parking lot that was halffull of mostly shabby cars and left my mg beside one of the defunct drivein speaker poles the interior of the restaurant took me back to my high school days orange leatherette booths beside the plate glass windows a long formica counter with stools laminated colour pictures of disgustinglooking food on the wall above the passthrough counter from the kitchen instead of a jukebox there was a bank of video games along one wall three filipino youths in jeans and denim jackets gathered around one called invader the kabalyeros i assumed i crossed to the counter with only a cursory glance at the trio sat and ordered coffee from a young waitress who looked to be eurasian the kabalyeros didnt conceal their interest in me they stared openly and after a moment one of them said something that sounded like ticktick and they all laughed nastily some sort of tagalog obscenity i supposed i ignored them sipping the dishwaterweak coffee and after a bit they went back to their game i took out the paperback that i keep in my bag for protective coloration and pretended to read listening to the few snatches of conversation that drifted over from the three i caught the names of two sal and hectorthe latter presumably bulis the gangs leader when i glanced covertly at him i saw he was tallish and thin with long hair caught back in a ponytail his features were razorsharp and slightly skewed creating the impression of a perpetual sneer the trio kept their voices low and although i strained to hear i could make out nothing of what they were saying after about five minutes hector turned away from the video machine with a final glance at me he motioned to his companions and they all left the restaurant i waited until theyd driven away in an old green pontiac before i called the waitress over and showed her my identification the three men who just left i said is the tall one hector bulis her lips formed a little o as she stared at the id finally she nodded may i talk with you about them she glanced toward the passthrough to the kitchen my boss he dont like me talking with the customers when im supposed to be working take a break just five minutes now she looked nervously around the restaurant i shouldnt i slipped a twentydollar bill from my wallet and showed it to her just five minutes she still seemed edgy but fear lost out to greed okay but i dont want anybody to see me talking to you go back to the restroomits through that door by the video games ill meet you there as soon as i can i got up and found the ladies room it was tiny dimly lit with a badly cracked mirror the walls were covered with a mass of graffiti some of it looked as if it had been painted over and had later worked its way back into view through the fading layers of enamel the air in there was redolent of grease cheap perfume and stale cigarette and marijuana smoke i leaned against the sink as i waited the young eurasian woman appeared a few minutes later bastard gave me a hard time she said tried to tell me id already taken my break whats your name anna smith anna the three men who just leftdo they come in here often uhhuh keep pretty much to themselves dont they its more like other people stay away from them she hesitated theyre from one of the gangs you dont mess with them thats why i wanted to talk with you back here have you ever heard them say anything about tommy dragon the dragon sure hes in jail they say he was framed of course they would claim that what about a mrs angelesamorfina angeles not that one no what about trying to intimidate someone setting fires going after someone with a gun uhuh thats gang business they keep it pretty close but it wouldnt surprise me filipinosim part filipina myself my mom met my dad when he was stationed at subic bay theyve got this saying kumukulo ang dugo it means the blood is boiling they can get pretty damn mad specially the men so stuff like what you saidsure they do it do you work on fridays yeah two to ten did you see any of the kabalyeros in here last friday around six that was the time when isabel had been accosted anna smith scrunched up her face in concentration last friday oh yeah sure that was when they had the big meeting all of them all of them uhhuh started around five thirty went on a couple of hours my boss he was worried something heavy was gonna go down but the way it turned out all he did was sell a lot of food what was this meeting about had to do with the dragon who was gonna be character witnesses at the trial what theyd say the image of the three id seen earlieror any of their ilkas character witnesses was somewhat ludicrous but i supposed in tommy dragons position you took what you could get are you sure they were all there uhhuh and no one at the meeting said anything about trying to keep mrs angeles from testifying no that lawyer the dragons got he was there too now that was odd why had dragons public defender chosen to meet with his witnesses in a public place i could think of one good reason he was afraid of them didnt want them in his office but what if the kabalyeros had set the time and placeas an alibi for when isabel was to be assaulted i better get back to work anna smith said before the boss comes looking for me i gave her the twenty dollars thanks for your time sure halfway out the door she paused frowning i hope i didnt get any of the kabalyeros in trouble you didnt good i kind of like them i mean they push dope and all but these days who doesnt these days who doesnt i thought good lord the starlight lanes was an oldfashioned bowling alley girded by a rough cliff face and an auto dismantlers yard the parking lot was crowded so i left the mg around back by the garbage cans inside the lanes were brightly lit and noisy with the sound of crashing pins rumbling balls shouts and groans i paused by the front counter and asked where i might find jimmy willis the woman behind it directed me to a lane at the far end bowling alleysor lanes as the new upscale bowler prefers to call themare familiar territory to me up until a few years ago my favourite uncle jim was a top player on the pro tour the starlight lanes reminded me of the ones where jim used to practice in san diegofrom the racks full of tiredlooking rental shoes to the greasyspoon coffeeshop smells to the moulded plastic chairs and cigaretteburned scorekeeping consoles i walked along soaking up the ambiencesome people would say the lack of ituntil i came to lane and spotted an agile young black man bowling alone jimmy willis was a lefthander and his ball hooked back with deadly precision i waited in the spectator area admiring his accuracy and graceful form his concentration was so great that he didnt notice me until hed finished the last frame and retrieved his ball youre quite a bowler i said whats your average he gave me a long look before he replied two hundred almost good enough to turn pro thats what im looking to do odd for the head of a street gang that dealt in drugs and death you ever hear of jim mccone i asked sure damned good in his day hes my uncle no kidding willis studied me again now as if looking for a resemblance rapport established i showed him my id and explained that i wanted to talk about reg dawsons murder he frowned hesitated then nodded okay since youre jim mccones niece but youll have to buy me a beer deal willis towelled off his ball stowed it and his shoes in their bag and led me to a typical smokefilled murkily lighted bowling alley bar he took one of the booths while i fetched us a pair of buds as i slid into the booth i said what can you tell me about the murder the way i see it dawson was asking for it so he and dawsons wife were of a mind about that i can understand what you mean but it seems strange coming from you i hear you were his friend that you took over the victors after his death you heard wrong on both counts yeah i was in the victors and when dawson bought it they tried to get me to take over but by then id figured outnever mind how doesnt matterthat i wanted out of that life aint nothing in it but what happened to benny crespo and dawsonor whats gonna happen to the dragon so i decided to put my hand to something with a future he patted the bowling bag that sat on the banquette beside him got a job here nownot much but my bowlings free and im on my way good for you what about dragondo you think hes guilty willis hesitated looking thoughtful why you ask just wondering well to tell you the truth i never did believe the dragon shot reg who did then he shrugged i asked him if hed heard about the kabalyeros trying to intimidate the chief prosecution witness when he nodded i said they also threatened the life of her daughter last friday he laughed mirthlessly wish i could of seen that kind of surprises me though that lawyer of dragons he found out what the kabalyeros were up to read them the riot act said theyd put dragon in the gas chamber for sure so they called it off when was this week ten days ago long before isabel had been accosted before the dead dog and shooting incidents too are you sure its what i hear you know in a way im surprised that theyd go after mrs angeles at all why the filipinos have this macho tradition specially when it comes to their women they dont like them messed with specially by nonfilipinos so how come theyd turn around and mess with one of their own well her testimony would jeopardise the life of one of their fellow gang members its an extreme situation cant argue with that jimmy willis and i talked a bit more but he couldntor wouldntoffer any further information i bought him a second beer then went out to where id left my car and came facetoface with hector bulis and the man called sal sal grabbed me by the arm twisted it behind me and forced me up against the latticework fence surrounding the garbage cans the stench from them filled my nostrils sals breath rivalled it in foulness i struggled but he got hold of my other arm and pinned me tighter i looked around saw no one nothing but the cliff face and the high board fence of the auto dismantlers yard bulis approached flicking open a switchblade his twisty face intense i stiffened went very still eyes on the knife bulis placed the tip of the knife against my jawbone then traced a line across my cheek dont want to hurt you bitch he said you do what i say i wont have to mess you up the tagalog phrase that anna smith had translated for mekumukulo ang dugoflashed through my mind the blood is boiling i sensed buliss wasand dangerously high i wet my dry lips tried to keep my voice from shaking as i said what do you want me to do we hear youre asking around about dawsons murder trying to prove the dragon did it thats not we want you to quit go back to your own part of town and leave our business alone whoever told you that is lying im only trying to help the angeles family they wouldnt lie he moved the knifes tip to the hollow at the base of my throat i felt it pierce my skina mere pinprick but frightening enough when i could speak i did so slowly phrasing my words carefully what i hear is that dragon is innocent and that the kabalyeros arent behind the harassment of the angelesesat least not for a week or ten days bulis exchanged a look with his companionquick unreadable someones trying to frame you i added just like they did dragon bulis continued to hold the knife to my throat his hand firm his gaze wavered however as if he was considering what id said after a moment he asked all rightwho im not sure but i think i can find out he thought a bit longer then let his arm drop and snapped the knife shut ill give you till this time tomorrow he said then he stuffed the knife into his pocket motioned for sal to let go of me and the two quickly walked away i sagged against the latticework fence feeling my throat where the knife had pricked it it had bled a little but the flow already was clotting my knees were weak and my breath came fast but i was too caught up in the possibilities to panic there were plenty of themand the most likely was the most unpleasant kumukuld ang dugo the blood is boiling two hours later i was back at the angeles house on omega street when amor admitted me the tension id felt in her earlier had drained her body sagged as if the extra weight she carried had finally proved to be too much for her frail bones the skin of her face looked flaccid like melting putty her eyes were sunken and vague after she shut the door and motioned for me to sit she sank into the recliner expelling a sigh the house was quiettoo quiet i have a question for you i said what does ticktick mean in tagalog her eyes flickered with dull interest tiktik she corrected my pronunciation its a word for detective ever since hector bulis and sal had accosted me id suspected as much where did you hear that amor asked one of the kabalyeros said it when i went to fat robbies earlier someone had told them i was a detective probably described me whoever it was said i was trying to prove tommy dragon killed reg dawson why would more to the point who would at the time only four people knew that im a detective she wet her lips but remained silent amor the night of the shooting you were standing in your front window watching for isabel yes do you do that often yes because isabel is often late coming home because youre afraid she may have gotten into trouble a mother worries especially when shes given good cause isabel is running out of control isnt she no she amor when i spoke with madeline dawson she said you were standing in the window watching for sweet isabel like always she didnt say sweet in a pleasant way later jimmy willis implied that your daughter is not exactly a vulnerable young girl amors eyes sparked the dawson woman is jealous of course she is theres something else when i asked the waitress at fat robbies if shed ever overheard the kabalyeros discussing you she said no not that one it didnt register at the time but when i talked to her again a little while ago she told me isabel is the member of your family they discuss they say shes wild runs around with the men in the gangs you know that so does alex and so does madeline dawson she just told me the first man isabel became involved with was her husband amor seemed to shrivel she gripped the arms of the chair whiteknuckled its true isnt it i asked more gently she lowered her eyes nodding when she spoke her voice was ragged i dont know what to do with her anymore ever since that reg dawson got to her shes been different not my girl at all is she on drugs alex says no but im not so sure i let it go it didnt really matter when she came home earlier i said isabel seemed very interested in me she asked questions looked me over carefully enough to be able to describe me to the kabalyeros she was afraid of what i might find out for instance that she wasnt accosted by any men with guns last friday she was no amor that was just a story to make it look as if your lifeand your childrenswere in danger if you testified in spite of what you said early on you havent wanted to testify against tommy dragon from the very beginning when the kabalyeros began harassing you a month ago you saw that as the perfect excuse not to take the stand but you didnt foresee that dragons lawyer would convince the gang to stop the harassment when that happened you and isabel and probably alex too manufactured incidentsthe shotout window the dead dog on the doorstep the men with the gunsto make it look as if the harassment was still going on why would i theyre going to put me in jail but at the time you didnt know they could do thator that your employer would hire me my investigating poses yet another danger to you and your family this is why would i do all that because basically youre an honest woman a good woman you didnt want to testify because you knew dragon didnt shoot dawson its my guess you gave the police his name because it was the first one that came to mind i had no reason to you had the best reason in the world a mothers desire to protect her child she was silent sunken eyes registering despair and defeat i kept on even though i hated to inflict further pain on her the day he died dawson had let the word out that he was going to desecrate bennys space the person who shot him knew there would be fighting and confusion counted on that as a cover the killer hated dawson lots of people did but only one person youd want to protect so badly that youd accuse an innocent man leave my mother alone shes suffered enough on account of what i did i turned alex had come into the room so quietly i hadnt noticed now he moved midway between amor and me a saturday night special clutched in his right hand the missing murder weapon i tensed but one look at his face told me he didnt intend to use it instead he raised his arm and extended the gun grip first take this he said i never should of bought it never should of used it i hated dawson on account of what he did to my sister but killing him wasnt worth what weve all gone through since i glanced at amor tears were trickling down her face alex said mama dont cry im not worth it when she spoke it was to me what will happen to him nothing like what might have happened to dragon alex is a juvenile you however i dont care about myself only my children maybe that was the trouble she was the archetypal selfless mother living only for her children sheltering them from the consequences of their actionsand in the end doing them irreparable harm there were times when i felt thankful that i had no children and there were times when i was thankful that jack stuart was a very good criminal lawyer this was a time when i was thankful on both counts i went to the phone called jack and asked him to come over here at least i could leave the angeles family in good legal hands after he arrived i went out into the gathering dusk an old yellow vw was pulling out of bennys space i walked down there and stood on the curb nothing remained of the shrine to benny crespo nothing remained to show that blood had boiled and been shed here it was merely a stretch of cracked asphalt splotched with oil drippings littered with the detritus of urban life i stared at it for close to a minute then turned away from the bleak landscape of omega street credits barnes linda lucky penny by linda barnes first appeared in the new black mask no copyright by linda barnes reprinted
