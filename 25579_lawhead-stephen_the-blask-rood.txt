stephen lawhead the blask rood part i november paphos cyprus the summons came while i was sitting at my desk the afternoon post had just been deliveredthe office boy placing the tidy bundle into my trayso i thought nothing of it as i slid the paper knife along the pasted seam it was only upon shaking out the small creamcoloured card that my full attention was engaged i flipped the card over on the blotter the single word tonight written in a fine script brought me upright in my chair i felt my stomach tighten as an uncontainable thrill tingled through me this was followed by an exasperated sigh as i slumped back in my chair the card thrust at arms length as if to hold off the inevitable demand of that single portentous word truth to tell a fair length of time had passed since the last meeting of the inner circle and i suppose a sort of complacency had set in which resented this sudden and unexpected intrusion into my wellordered existence i stared at the offending word fighting down the urge to pretend i had not seen it indeed i quickly shoved it out of sight into the middle of my sheaf of letters and attempted to forget about it curiosity and a highlyhoned sense of duty won the struggle resigning myself to my fate i rang for one of the lads and sent him off with a hastily scribbled note of apology to my wife explaining that an engagement of the utmost importance had just arisen and she must soldier on without me for the evening and please not to wait up as i anticipated being very late a swift glance in my desk diary revealed that as luck would have it the familial household was to be appropriated for a meeting of certain august members of the ladies literacy institute and temperance union a gaggle of wellmeaning old dears whose overabundant maternal energies have been directed to the improvement of society through reading and abstinence from strong drinkexcept sherry worthy goals to be sure but unspeakably dull instantly my resentful resignation turned to unbounded elation i was delighted to have a genuine excuse to forego the dull agonies of an evening which if past experience was any indicator could only be described as boredom raised to the level of high art having shed this onerous domestic chore new vistas of possibility opened before me i considered dining at the club but decided on taking an early supper so as to leave plenty of time for the cab journey to the chapel where the members of our clandestine group met on these rare occasions with a contrite heart made buoyant by a childlike excitement i contemplated the range of alternatives before me there were several new restaurants in hanover street that i had been meaning to try with a public house nearby recommended by a junior colleague in the firm off the leash for the night i determined my course when work finished for the day i lingered for a time in my office attending to a few small tasks until i was certain the office boys and junior staff had gone and i would not be followed however accidentally i feel it does no harm to take special precautions on these infrequent occasions no doubt it is more for my own amusement than anything else but it makes me feel better all the same i should not like even the slightest carelessness on my part to compromise the inner circle after a pint of porter at the wallace arms i proceeded around the corner to alexanders chop house where i dined on a passable roast rabbit in mustard sauce and a glass of firstrate claret before the cab arrived as the evening was fine and unseasonably balmy i asked the driver to pull the top of the carriage back and enjoyed a splendid drive through the city and out into the nearby countryside i arranged with the driver to meet me for the return journey and when he was well out of sight walked the last mile or so to the chapel to meet the others upon nearing the place i saw someone hurrying up the lane ahead of me i recognized the fellow as de cardou but i did not hail him we never draw attention to one another in public even the brotherhoods lower orders are advised to refrain from acknowledging a fellow member in passing on the street for them it is a discipline which faithfully applied may lead to greater advancement in time for the inner circle it is an unarguable necessitynow more than ever if such a thing can be possible admittedly these arcane concerns seem very far away from the honest simplicity of life on the greek island where i now find myself here in the sunsoaked hills above paphos it is easy to forget the storm clouds gathering in the west but the writing is on the wall for anyone with eyes to see even i the newest recruit to our hallowed and holy order recognize dangers which did not exist a year or two ago and in these last days such dangers will only increase if ever i doubted the importance of the brotherhood i doubt it no longer our meeting that night was solemn and sobering we met in the star chamber hidden beneath the chancel as it affords a more comfortable setting for discussion i took my seat at the round table and after the commencement ritual and prayer genotti asked to begin the proceedings with a report on the brotherhoods interests in south america and the need for urgent intervention in the worsening political climate while the peace treaty concluded in the first months of last year between chile and brazil remains in force he said efforts to undermine the treaty continue it has come to my attention that agents in the employ of caldero a dangerous anarchistic political faction are planning an attack on the palace of the chilean president this attack will be blamed on brazil in an effort to draw the two governments back into open conflict evans our number two expressed the concern of the group and asked genottis recommendation it is my belief that the presidential staff must be warned of course so that protective measures may be taken i also advocate with the brotherhoods approval monies to be advanced to fund the training of an agent to be placed within caldero and bring about its selfdestruction ordinarily such a proposal would have engendered a lengthy discussion on the manner and methods of implementing a plan this time however pemberton rose to his feet and before debate could begin thanked genotti for his industry on the brotherhoods behalf however he said his voice taking on a sepulchral tone it is becoming increasingly clear that our ventures into the manipulation of political systems cannot continue it is dangerous and potentially destructive to the overall aims of the inner circlenot least because such meddling in the power structures of sovereign nations possesses a vast and unperceived potential to seduce us away from our prime objectives tall and gaunt in his red robe with the golden cross over the heart pemberton looked around the table to ensure that each of us understood him precisely furthermore gentlemen it is increasingly evident that the world has embarked on a new and frightening course and we cannot hope to remain uncorrupted by the increasingly corrosive powers beginning to assert their influence on the individual populations of this planet south america is in ferment eastern europe is rapidly sliding towards political anarchy and chaos the clouds of war are darkening the skies in a dozen places citing example after undeniable example our wise leader revealed to us not only the shape and form but the vast extent of the wickedness about to fall upon an unsuspecting world new threats call for new strategies in short gentlemen we must adapt our methods if we are to survive we must prepare for a new crusade he went on to lay out for us the battle plan which would shape our future from that night when he finished one by one we of the sanctus clarus guardians of the true path stood to renew our sacred vows and pledge ourselves to this new crusade our ancient enemy arms itself and its countless minions with new and ever more powerful weapons of mass destruction so that night we soldiers of the holy light likewise armed ourselves for the coming conflict in the undying spirit of the cele de we summoned the ageold courage of those dauntless celtic crusaders who have gone before us and shouldertoshoulder took our places beside them on the battle line the war will come it is both imminent and inevitable for the present however as i look out on the glimmering cypriot sea and smell the heady blossomscented breeze and feel the warmth of the sun and the gentle abiding love of my good wife i will savour the last lingering benevolence of a more humane era which when it is gone will not be known again tomorrows travails will keep until tomorrow while the sun yet shines i will delight myself in this glorious season and cherish it against the evil day one the feast of st george anno domini my dearest caitriona the worst has happened as old pedar would say i am sore becalmed my glorious dream is ashes and dust it died in the killing heat of a nameless syrian desertalong with eight thousand good men whose only crime was that of fealty to a stubborn arrogant boy i could weep for them but for the fact that i no less headstrong and haughty than that misguided boy will shortly follow them to the grave the saracens insist that i am the esteemed guest of the caliph of cairo in truth this is nothing more than a polite way of saying i am a captive in his house they treat me well indeed since coming to the holy land i have not known such courtesy nor such elegance nevertheless i cannot leave the palace until the caliph has seen me it is for him to decide my fate i know too well what the outcome will be be that as it may the great caliph is pursuing enemies in the south and is not expected to return to the city for a goodly while thus i have time enough and liberty to set down what can be told about our great and noble purpose so you will know why your father risked all he loved best in life for a single chance to obtain that prize which surpasses all others some of what i shall write is known to you if this grows tedious i ask you to bear with me and remember that this my last testament is not for you alone my heart but for those who will join us in our labours in days to come god willing all will be told before the end so now where to begin let us start with the day torfeinar came back from the dead i was with your grandfather murdo at the church helping to oversee the builders working there the previous summer we had purchased a load of cut stone for the arches and thresholds and were preparing the site for the arrival of the shipment which was due at any time your grandfather and abbot emlyn were standing at the table in the yard studying the drawings which brother paulus had made for the building when one of the monks came running from the fields to say that a boat was putting into the bay we quickly assembled a welcome party and went down to meet it the ship was smallan island runner onlybut it was not from orkneyjar nor was it one of king sigurds fishing boats as some had assumed the sailors had rowed the vessel into shallow water and were lifting down a bundle by the time we reached the cove there were four boatmen in the water and three on deck and they had a board between them which they were straining to lower obviously heavy they were at pains to keep from dropping their cargo into the cove they are traders from eire suggested one of the women i wonder what they have brought it looks like a heap of old rags said another the sailors muscled their burden over the rail and waded ashore as they drew nearer i saw that the board was really a litter with a body strapped to it they placed this bundle of cloth and bone before us on the strand and stepped awayas if mightily glad to have done with an onerous task i thought it must be the body of some poor seaman one of their own perhaps who had died at sea no sooner had they put it down however than this corpse began to shout and thrash about unbind me it cried throwing its thin limbs around let me up those on the strand gave a start and jumped back murdo however stepped closer and bent over the heaving mass of tatters torf he said stooping near is that you torfeinar to the amazement of everyone looking on the nearcorpse replied and who should it be but myself unbind me i say and let me up god in heaven cried murdo is it true gesturing to some of the men he said here my brother is back from the deadhelp me loose him i came forwards along with the abbot and several others and we untied my longlost uncle he had returned from the holy land where he had lived since the great pilgrimage the eldest of my fathers two brothers he and the next eldest skuli had joined with baldwin of bouillon in return for their loyal service they were given lands at edessa where they had remained ever since when asked what happened to his brothers murdo would always say that they had died chasing their fortunes in the holy land in all the years of my life till then i had never known it to be otherwise how not there never came any word from themnever a letter or even a greeting sent by way of a returning pilgrimthough opportunities must have been plentiful enough through the years that is why murdo said he had come back from the dead in a way he had for no one had ever expected to see torfeinar againeither in this world or the next but now here he was to my eyes little more than gristle and foul temper but alive still of his great fortune however there was not so much as the pale glimmer of a silver spoon the man i saw upon that crude litter had more in common with the soreridden beggars that huddle in the shelter of the monastery walls at kirkjuvagr than a lord of outremer even the lowest swineherd of such a lord would have presented a more impressive spectacle i swear we untied him and thereby learned the reason he had been carried to shore on a plank his legs were a mass of weeping sores he could not walk indeed he could barely sit upright still he objected to being bound to his bed and did not cease his thrashing until the cords were loosed and taken away after all these years why return now asked murdo sitting back on his heels i have come home to die replied torfeinar think you i could abide a grave in that godforsaken land the holy land godforsaken wondered emlyn shaking his head in amazement torfs wizened face clenched like a fist and he spat holy land he sneered the pigsty is more wholesome than that accursed place and the snake pit is more friendly what about your lands asked murdo what about your great fortune piss on the land growled torfeinar piss on the fortune too let the heathen have it twofaced demon spawn each and every one a plague on the swarthy races i say and devil take them all he became so agitated that he started thrashing around again murdo quickly said rest easy now torf you are among kinfolk nothing will harm you here we carried him to the dun and tried our best to make the old man comfortable i call him old man for that was how he appeared to me in truth he was only a few years older than my father the ravages of a life of constant warring and i think whoring had carved the very flesh from him his skin blasted dark by the unrelenting saracen sun was as cracked and seamed as weathered leather his faded hair was little more than a handful of grizzled wisps his eyes were held in a permanent squint and his limbs were so scarred from wounds that they seemed like gnarled stumps in all the oncehandsome lord looked like a shank bone that had been gnawed close and tossed onto the dungheap we brought him into the fortress and laid him in the hall murdo arranged for a pallet to be made up and placed in a corner near the hearth a screen was erected around the pallet to give torf a little peace from the comings and goings in the hall but also to shield others from the ragged sight of him to be sure the women scurried around and found food and drink for him and better clothesalthough the latter was not difficult for the meanest dog mat would have been better than his own foul feathers my lady mother would have preferred he had a bath before being allowed beneath her roof but he would have none of it when the servingmaid came near with hot water and a little scottish soap he cursed her so cruelly she ran away in tears he called upon heaven to witness his oath saying that the next time he bathed would be when they put him under the turf in the end murdo declared that he should be left alone and ragna had to abide she would not allow any of the maidens to serve him however and said that as he was manifestly unable to make himself agreeable to simple human courtesy he could receive his care from the stableboys hands even so i noticed she most often served him herself that torfeinar had come home to die soon became apparent his sores oozed constantly bleeding his small strength away that first night i happened to pass by the place where he lay on the pallet my father had had prepared for him and heard what i took to be an animal whimpering creeping close i looked on him to see that he had fallen asleep and one of the hounds was licking the lesions on his exposed leg the pain made poor torf moan in his sleep jesu forgive me i did not have it in me to stay by i turned away and left him to his wretched dreams over the next few days i learned much of life in the east sick as he was he did not mind talking to anyone who would listen to his fevered ramblings out of pity i undertook to bring him his evening meal to give my mother a respite from the tedium of the chore and sat with him while he ate thus i heard more than most about his life in the county of edessa in this way i also discovered what had befallen poor skuli true to his word lord baldwin had given torf and skuli land in return for service nor was he ungenerous in his giving the two brothers had taken adjoining lands so as to form one realm which they then shared between them our fortress at khemil was crowned with a palace that had fifty rooms he boasted one night as i fed him his pork broth and black bread his teeth were rotten and pained him so i had to break the bread into the broth to soften it and then feed it to him in gobbets he could gum awhile and swallow fifty rooms you hear that is a great many rooms i allowed he was obviously ill and somewhat addled in his thoughts we had sixtyeight menservants and forty servingmaids our treasure house had a door as thick as a mans trunk and bound in ironit took two men just to pull it open the room itself was big as a granary and hollowed out of solid stone he mumbled in his bread for a moment and then added gods truth in those first days that room was never less than full to the very top i supposed him to be lying to make his sad story less pathetic than it might have been by dreaming impossible riches for himself and it disgusted me that he should be so foolish and venal but cait it was myself who was the fool that night since coming to the east i have discovered the truth of his tale with my own eyes i have seen palaces which make the one at khemil seem like wicker cowsheds and treasure rooms larger than your grandfather murdos hall and filled with such plunder of silver and gold that the devil himself must squirm with envy at such an overabundance of wealth that night however i believed not a word of his bragging i fed him his bread and made small comments when they were required mostly i just sat by his side and listened trying to keep my eyes from his ravaged and wasted body there was an orchard on our landspear trees by the hundreds and three great olive groves and one of figs aside from the principal fortress at khemil we owned the right to rule the two small villages and market within the borders of our realm also since the road from edessa to aleppo ran through the southern portion of our lands we were granted rights to collect the toll in all it was a fine place we ruled as kings that first year jerusalem had fallen and we shared in the plunder at edessa count baldwin was amassing great power and even more wealth he made us vassal lordsskuli and i were lords of edessa under baldwinalong with a score or more just like us all that first year we never lifted a blade nor saddled a horse save to ride to the hunt we ate the best food and drank the best wine and contented ourselves with the improving of our realm then skuli died fever took him mark me the deserts of the east are breeding grounds for disease and pestilence of all kinds he lingered six days and gave out on the seventh the day i buried skuli that same day mindword came to edessa that godfrey was dead the fever had claimed him too or maybe it was poison he fell silent wandering in his thoughts to lead him gently back i asked who was godfrey he squinted up an eye and regarded me suspiciously did murdo never tell you anything my father has told me much of the great pilgrimage i replied indignantly the old mans mouth squirmed in derision he has told you nothing at all if you do not know godfrey of bouillon first king of jerusalem i knew of the man not from my father it is truemurdo rarely spoke of the crusade abbot emlyn however talked about it all the time i remember sitting at his feet while he told of their adventures in the holy land that good monk could tell a tale as you well know and i never tired of listening to anything he would say thus i knew a great deal about lord godfrey defender of the holy sepulchre and his immeasurable folly that night however i was more interested in what torf might know and did not care to reveal my own thoughts so i said godfrey was baldwins brother then he was and a more courageous man i never met a very lion on the battlefield no one could stand against him yet when he was not slaying the infidel he was on his knees in prayer for all he was a holy man torf paused as if remembering the greatness of the man then he added godfrey was an ass after what hed said this assessment surprised me why i asked torf gummed some more bread and then motioned for the bowl he drained the bowl noisily put it aside and lay back why he fixed me with his mocking gaze i suppose you are one of those who think godfrey a saint now i think nothing of the kind i assured him he was a good enough man maybe but he was no saint torfeinar declared sourly the devil take me i never saw a man make so many boneheaded mistakes one after another and just that quickas if he feared he could not make them fast enough godfrey might have been a sturdy soldier but he had no brain for kingcraft he proved that with the iron lance his use of that name brought me up short as you can imagine i tried to hide my amazement but he saw i knew and said oh ayeso your father told you something after all did he he has told me a little i replied although this was not strictly true murdo never spoke about the holy lance at all again the little i knew of it came from the good abbot did he tell you how the great imbecile gave it right back to the emperor the instant he got his hands on it torf gave a cruel little laugh which ended in a gurgling cough no i answered my father never told me that he did by christ i swear he did torf chortled malevolently only godfrey could have thrown away something so priceless the stupid fool it was his first act as ruler of jerusalem too he got nothing in return for it either i can tell you torf then proceeded to tell me how moments after accepting the throne of jerusalem godfrey had been deceived by the imperial envoy into agreeing to give up the holy lance which the crusaders had discovered in antioch and with which the crusaders had conquered the odious muhammedans in order to escape the ignominy of surrendering christendoms most valued possession jerusalems new lord had hit upon the plan to send the sacred relic to pope urban for safekeeping it was either that or fight the emperor allowed torf grudgingly and we were no match for the imperial troops we would have been cut down to a man it would have been a slaughter no one crosses blades with the immortals and lives to tell the tale it seemed to me that godfrey had been placed in an extremely tight predicament by the western lords and i said so pah spat torf the greeks are cunning fiends and deception is mothers milk to them godfrey should have known that he could never outwit a wily greek with trickery his plan seemed simple enough to me i told him there was little enough trickery in it that i can see where did he go wrong he sent it to jaffa with only a handful of knights as escort and the seljuqs ambushed them if hed waited a few days he could have sent the relic with a proper armymost of the troops were leaving the holy land soonand the turks would never have taken it the turks took it i asked is that not what im saying he grumbled of course they took it the thieving devils i thought you said godfrey gave it to the emperor he meant to give it to the emperor growled torfeinar irritably if you would keep your mouth closedinstead of blathering on endlessly you might learn something boy torf called me boy even though i had a wife and child of my own i suppose i seemed very young to him or perhaps very far beneath his regard i told him id try to keep quiet so he could get on with his tale it would be a mercy he grumbled testily i said the seljuqs took the holy lance and if it was up to them theyd have it to this day but bohemond suspected godfrey would try some idiot trick and secretly arranged to follow the relic when godfreys knights left jerusalem the count of antioch got word of it and gave chase prince bohemond of taranto knew about the lance too of course it was bohemond who had taken king magnus into his service to provide warriors for the princes depleted army owing to this friendship king magnus had prospered greatly it was from magnus that we had our lands in caithness torf was not unaware of this he said godfrey and baldwin had no love for bohemond nor for his vassal magnus still he looked around at the wellordered expansive hall i can see the king has been good to you a man must make what friends he can hey i suppose you suppose he laughed at me i speak the truth and you know it in this world a man must get whatever he can from the chances hes given you make your bargains and hope for the best if i had been in murdos place i might have done the same i bear your father no ill in the matter i am certain he will leap with joy to hear it i muttered that was the wrong thing to say for he swore an oath and told me he was sick of looking at me i left him in a foul temper and went to bed that night wondering whether i would ever hear what he knew about the iron lance two torfeinar had indeed come home to die it soon became apparent that whatever health was left to him he had spent it on the journey despite our care of him he did not improve each day saw a diminution of his swiftly eroding strength i fed him the next night in silence owing to my discourtesy of the previous evening he refused to speak to me and i feared he would die before i found out any more about what he knew of the iron lance i spoke to my father about this but murdo remained uninterested he advised me to leave it be it is just stories he remarked sourly no doubt he knows a great many such travellers tales when i insisted that there must be more to it than that he grew angry and snapped it is all lies and dangerous nonsense duncan god knows leave well enough alone well how could i the next evening i found torf in a better humour so i said you said godfrey was a fool for losing the holy lance if he was ambushed by the turks i cannot see what he could have done about it and i suppose you know all about such things now he sneered were you there he puffed out his cheeks in derision had it not been for bohemond the thieving turks would have made off with the prize forever what did bohemond do he pursued the turks and caught them outside jaffa replied torf they fought through the night and when the sun came up the next morning bohemond had the holy lance then it was bohemond who gave the lance to the emperor i replied that he did torf confirmed forgive me uncle i said determined not to offend him again but it seems to me that bohemond was no better than godfrey torf frowned at me and i thought he would not answer after a moment he said at least he got himself something for his trouble in return for the lance he obtained the support of the emperorand that was worth the cost of the relic many times over i can tell you this seemed odd to me i could not understand why he should hold godfrey to blame yet absolve bohemond whose actions appeared in every way just as suspect if not more so realizing that i would only make him angry again i refrained from asking any further questions still i turned the matter over in my mind that night and determined to ask abbot emlyn about it the next day i found the good abbot at the new church the following morning and succeeded in arousing his interest with a few welljudged questions glancing up from the drawings before him he said who have you been talking to my friend i am giving torfeinar his meals in the evening i began and he has told you these tales aye some of them the priest wrinkled his brow and pursed his lips well perhaps he knows a little about it something in emlyns tone gave the lie to his words but you do not believe him i observed it is not for me to say the abbot answered evasively now i had never known the good priest to give me or anyone else cause to doubt him but his answer seemed strange and i suspected he knew much more than he was telling who better i said pursuing him gently my father perhaps emlyn frowned again sometimes he said slowly it is better to let the dead bury the dead i think you will get no thanks from murdo for sticking your nose into the hive true enough i concluded gloomily i already asked him what did he say asked the cleric he said it was all just stories i replied travellers tales and lies the abbot frowned again but said nothing this made me even more determined for i could plainly see that there was more to the tale than they were telling i got no more out of abbot emlyn that day however indeed i might never have got to the heart of the mystery if torf had died before speaking of the black rood that very night his strength failed him he grew fevered and fell into the sleep of death murdo summoned some of the monks from saint andrews abbey to come and do what they could for the old man and emlyn came too along with a monk named padraig as it happens padraig is emlyns nephewthe son of his only sister a thoughtful wellmeaning monk despite the fact that he grew up in eire our good abb has children of his own of course two daughtersone of whom lives with her husbands kinfolk south of caithness near inbhir ness the other niniane is a priest herself as gentle and wise as her father and who through no fault of her own has the very great misfortune to be married to my brother eirik now then it is well known that the cele de are wonderfully wise in all things touching the healing arts they are adept at preparing medicines of surpassing potency and virtue brother padraig set to work at the hearth and in a short while had brewed an elixir which he spooned into the dying mans mouth this he repeated at intervals through the night and by morningwonder of wonderstorfeinar was awake once more he was still very weak and it was clear he would not recover but he was resting much easier now and the fire had left his eyes he seemed more at peace as i greeted him i asked him if there was anything he would like that i could get for him nay he said his voice hollow and rough unless you can get me a piece of the black rood for my confession nothing else will do me any good what is this black rood i asked if there is any of it nearby i am certain my father can get it for you this brought a smile to torfs cracked lips he shook his head weakly i doubt you will find it he croaked there are but four pieces in all the world and two of those are lost forever this rare thing intrigued me but what is it and what has it to do with your confession never heard of the true cross he regarded me hazily of course i have heard of that i told him everyone has heard of that one and the same boy one and the same the black rood is just another name for the true cross this made no sense to me if that is so why is it called black i asked suspicious of his explanation and why is it in so many pieces torf merely smiled and wet his lips with the tip of his tongue if i am to tell you that he replied i must have a drop to wet my throat turning to brother padraig who had just entered the hall and was approaching the sick mans pallet i said he is asking for ale may i give him some a little ale might do him some good replied the monk at least he shrugged it will do him no harm while the cleric set about making up some more of his elixir i went to the kitchen to fetch the ale returning with a stoup and bowl placing the stoup on the floor i dipped out a bowlful and gave it to torf who guzzled it down greedily he drank another before he was ready to commence his explanation so he said sinking back onto his pallet why is the rood called black you ask and i say because it is blackold and black it is and why is it in so many pieces because baldwin had it divided up replied torf with a dry chuckle i was about to ask him why this baldwin should have done such a thing but abbot emlyn entered the hall just then to see how the sick man had fared the night i think he was expecting to see a corpse and instead found torf sitting up and talking with me after a brief word with padraig he came and sat down beside the sickbed it seems that god has blessed us with your company a little longer my friend emlyn said it will not be god torf replied but the devil himself who drags me under never say it chided emlyn shaking his head gently you are not so far from gods blessing my friend of that i am certain torfs lips curled in a vicious sneer pah i am not afraid i did as i pleased and i am ready to pay the ferryman what is owed get you gone priest i wont be shriven as you say allowed emlyn but know that i will remain near and i will do whatever may be done to ease your passing torf frowned and i thought he might send emlyn away with a curse so i spoke up quickly saying my uncle was just about to tell me how the true cross was cut into pieces is this so wondered emlyn indeed so answered torf then what i have heard is true said the abbot the holy cross of christ has been found aye they found it answered torf and i was there i noticed the light come up in his eyes and he seemed to rise to his tale extraordinary murmured emlyn softly godfrey it was who found the crossin the church of the holy sepulchre torf told us he had gone with his chaplain and some priests to pray it was after the western lords had begun returning home leaving only godfrey baldwin and bohemond in the holy land to defend jerusalem well bohemond had sailed for constantinople with the emperors envoy bearing the holy lance into greek captivity baldwin was preparing to return to edessa and we were all eager to go with him for he had said he would begin apportioning the land he had promised his noblemen some of this i know mused emlyn nodding to himself aye well the night before we were to leave jerusalem word came to us that alafdal the vizier of egypt had landed ships at ascalon and that fifty thousand saracens were marching for jerusalem rather than allow them to put the city under siege godfrey decided to meet them on the road before they could raise help from the defeated turks taken together godfreys troops and baldwins amounted to fewer than seven thousand and of those only five hundred were knights the rest were footmen leaving baldwin to prepare the troops for battle godfrey went to the church to pray a swift and certain victory for us despite the odds against us while godfrey was praying one of the priests fell into a trance and had a vision i cannot say how it happened but the way i heard it was that a man in white appeared to him and showed him a curtain this white priest told the monk to pull aside the curtain and take up what he found there when the priest awoke however the curtain was gone and he was staring at a whitewashed wall only no doubt it would have ended there except godfrey came to hear of it and said a wall is sometimes called a curtain so he orders the wall to be taken down and behold there is the true cross god be praised gasped emlyn clasping his hands reverently it seems continued torf ignoring the abbots outburst that when the saracens first captured the city those churches they did not destroy they turned into mosqs in the church of the holy sepulchre they found the true cross hanging above the altar but even those heathen devils did not dare lay a hand on it so they walled it up they mixed a thick mortar and covered over the sacred relic hiding it from view godfrey orders the mortar to be pulled down and there it is the true cross is found the king declares it to be a sign of gods good pleasure and orders everyone to kneel before the holy relic and pray for victory in the coming battle this is difficult to do for the church is very small and there are so many soldiers so he orders the cross to be brought out to us and we all kneel down before it skuli and i find ourselves near the front ranks and we see the cross as the priests walk by two priests led by godfreys chaplain hold it between them and two more walk behind carrying censers of burning incense i look up as it passes by and i see what looks to be a long piece of rough timber slightly bowed along its length it is perhaps half a rod long and thick as a mans thigh i know it is the true cross because it is blackened with age and its surface has been smoothed by the countless hands that have reverenced it through the years the prayers are said and the monks are returning to the church as they carry the cross away someone behind cries out let the cross go before us that is all it takesat once everyone is up and shouting let the cross go before us godfrey hears this and calls for order to be restored he says it has pleased god to deliver this most sacred relic into our hands as a sign of his good pleasure in the restoring of his holy city as we have kept faith with god so god has kept faith with us the enemies of christ are even now marching against us cries godfrey his voice shaking with righteous rage i say this crossthis black roodshall go before us into battle from this day forth it shall be the emblem of jerusalems defenders so that those who raise sword against us shall know that christ himself leads his holy army to victory against the enemies of our faith the monks begin chanting rejoice o nations with gods people for he will avenge the blood of his servants he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and that is how it began so saying torf slumped back exhausted by the effort i stared at him in amazement that he should recall so much of what happened that day long ago brother padraig who had crept near to hear the tale motioned to me to fill the bowl again i poured the ale and held the bowl to the sick mans lips torf drank and revived somewhat rest now suggested emlyn we will talk again when you are feeling better a bitter smile twisted torfeinars lips i will never feel better than i do now he whispered anyway there is little more to say we rode out from jerusalem the next day and met the arabs on the road from ascalon two days later they were not expecting us to attack and had not yet formed a proper invasion force two knights carried the cross between them and godfrey led the charge we fell upon alafdals confused army and scattered them to the winds we routed the infidel and sent them flying back to their ships torf drank some more and pushed the bowl away that was the first time the black rood went before us into battle but it was not the last he shook his head almost sadly not the last by god how did the holy cross come to be cut into pieces i asked he turned his head to look at me and i saw that the light of life was growing dim in his eyes godfrey did it when the troops saw that victory was assured whenever the cross was carried into battle they refused to fight unless it went before them he swallowed and closed his eyes but the turks and saracens were relentless and the cross could not be everywhere at once so he cut it up i surmised torf gave the ghost of a nod what else could he do i swear that man never looked further ahead than the length of his own two feet with everyone clamouring for a piece of the relic godfrey commanded that it should be cut in half the priests let him do this wondered emlyn in dismay aye the priests helped him do it said torf his voice growing thin and watery the patriarch of jerusalem objected but godfrey convinced him in the end you said they cut it into four parts i pointed out remembering what he had told me before this brought a flicker of irritation from torf who opened an eye and said they sent one half to the church at antioch to replace the iron lance which had been taken by the emperor this was to be used by the armies in the north the second half was kept in jerusalem to be used in southern battles over the years those two pieces became four surmised the abbot it is not difficult to see how this could happen you said that only two remain i pointed out what happened to the others torf sighed heavily the long talk was taxing his failing strength one piece was given to the emperor and the other two have fallen into the hands of the heathen infidel he sighed again his voice growing softer i cannot say more after awhile he drifted away i thought he had died but brother padraig pressed an ear to his chest and said he sleeps regarding the dying man he added i do not think he will wake again soon i rose reluctantly in the few days i had known torfeinar i had grown to like the crusty old crusader to be honest gait he had breathed an air of excitement into me although i had heard tales of the great pilgrimage all my life it always seemed to me something that happened too long ago and far away to interest me torfs unexpected appearance awakened the realization that the crusade continued in faroff lands men were fighting still in the holy land great deeds were still to be done torfs arrival also awakened questions in my mind why did my father regard his brothers appearance with such cool dispassion i had never known murdo to be a callous unfeeling man yet he showed his dying brother scant consideration or compassionand not so much as a crumb of curiosity about his life in the east what had passed between the two of them all those years ago was it fear i heard in his voice when i asked about the iron lance or was it something else after a brief word with padraig abbot emlyn rose to leave the hall and i followed him out into the yard determined to get some answers to my questions three i think your uncle will soon be standing before the throne of heaven emlyn said when i caught up with him in the yard i do not expect him to last the night i should tell your father he will want to know it seems to me i ventured that my father knows all he wants to of torfeinar the little round abbot regarded me with his quick eyes you think he does not care for his brother he replied but you are wrong in that young duncan murdo cares very much he hides it well then i concluded sourly emlyn stopped in his tracks and faced me there is more to this than you know murdo has his reasons for feeling and behaving the way he does nor will i tell him how he should feel or how he should act in this matter the force with which this was said surprised me it took emlyn aback too i think for he quickly added in a softer tone the wounds were deep at the time i think torfs return has reopened them and they are painful indeed accepting his appraisal i suggested then maybe it is time those old wounds were healed once and for all maybe that is why torf has come home abbot emlyn began walking again you could be right perhaps it is time we his voice drifted off as he turned the matter over in his mind i hurried after him what i demanded time for what he waved me off saying leave it with me i will speak to your father and then i called after him and then we shall see what we shall see the abbot hurried away and i found myself alone for the moment and with nothing to doa rare enough circumstance for me i decided to go and see if rhona was busy thinking maybe she would like to ride with me down to the sandy cove below the cliffs south of the bay rhona and i had been married for seven years and in that time had produced three children two boys and a girl sadly both boys died in the summer of their first year only you gait the smallest and scrawniest infant i ever saw survived to see your second year it seems so long ago now but that day the sun was high and the weather dry and i still had it in mind to have a son one day it seemed to me a splendid time to make a bairn or at least to try i found rhona sitting on a stool outside the storehouse peeling the outer skins from a bunch of onions to make the dye for caitrionas new gown she announced then seeing my expression rhona laughed and said did you think i would make you eat them for your supper if you cooked them i would eat them i replied oh you would she began taking the bowl from her lap i raised her to her feet and what is this youre about it is a fine day my love come out with me i thought you had work to do at the church the stone has not arrived yet and father can look after the builders i thought we might ride down to the cove she stepped closer holding her head to one side and you think i have nothing better to do than go flitting off with you all day i saw the hidden smile playing at her lips it is well other people have plenty to do since the young lord of this manor is an idle scapegrace well i sniffed if you do not wish to go i suppose i could ask one of the servingmaids perhaps the one with the soft brown eyes would not spurn an invitation from lord murdos handsome son lord murdos handsome son she said her mouth twitching with suppressed laughter i happen to know bishop eirik is away to inbhir ness on business for the abbey lady i said drawing her close to steal a kiss it was myself i was talking about not my bookish brother i made to kiss her then but she turned her face and i caught her cheek instead not here in the yard where everyone can see she gasped putting her hands on my chest and pushing me gently away then come away with me i slipped my hands around her slim waist and untied the apron covering her pale green gown the day is beautiful and so are you let us take our pleasure while we may someone has been listening to the maysingers she said drawing the apron over her head very well i will go with you duncan murdosson she bent and picked up the bowl of onion husks but i must put these away first i will saddle the horses and meet you at the gate i said stealing another kiss and hurrying away the horses were quickly readied and we were soon racing over the gorse and brackencovered hills to the south of the estate the lands of my fathers realm are great in extent but the soil is thin and rocky in most places also our vassals are not so numerous as other estates which means that we must all work the harder to survive that said there are good fields and grazing land to the west and fine fishing in the wide bay between the high sheltering headlands banvard has prospered us well enough and while we may not have possessed the ready wealth of more favoured realms we nevertheless raised enough in grain and cattle to feed ourselves and our vassals with plenty left over for gainful trade from what my mother had told me about her youth in orkneyjar it seemed to me that growing up in caithness was much the same and like my father life in the wild empty hills suited me not that we had forsaken orkney forever heaven forbid it we regularly traded at kirkjuvagr and murdo often took part in the councils there once a year the king held court at orphir and we always attended though we were lords of scotland now in many ways those lowscattered northern islands still held us in their sway indeed on a crisp day we can see the dark isles across the water like storm clouds spreading along the horizon or like a bevy of grey seals the islands raise their sleek heads from the surrounding sea on the day that rhona and i rode out however my mind was on other things with the sun on my back my lovely lady wife by my side and a good horse under me my thoughts were on the sweet joy of life itself i felt the fresh sea air on my face and smelled the damp earth and the flowersweet scent of green growing things and the blood ran strong in me we reached the cove and i tethered the horses at the clifftop where they could get a little grass rhona and i climbed down onto the sandy beach where we settled in a sunwarmed hollow in the long sea grass rhona untied the bundle she had brought with her and produced a loaf of bread a lump of cheese and an appleall of which i cut up with my knife and shared out between us after our little meal we lay back in the hollow and enjoyed the warmth of the sand and sun and the sound of the lazy waves on the shore rhona came readily into my embrace and we abandoned ourselves to our loving and afterward dozed in one anothers arms i awoke with my head upon my wifes breast and the sun lowering in the west the tide was lapping around the base of the dune the shadow of the cliffs had reached our oncesunny hollow and the air was growing cool i lifted my head and kissed my lady and she awoke with a shiver we should be getting back i suggested before they send the hounds to find us one more kiss my love said rhona pulling me close again we dressed quickly returned to the horses and rode slowly back to the dun enjoying the fiery extravagance of a setting sun which set the heavens ablaze with scarlet purple and gold even before reaching the road leading up to the fortress i knew something was amiss lashing our mounts to speed we hastened up the road through the open gates and into the empty yard i dismounted and helped rhona from her saddle letting the reins dangle we started for the hall and were met by brother padraig i took one look at his face and said is it over then your uncle died a short while ago he answered simply i nodded may god have mercy on his soul i whispered and felt rhona slip her hand into mine the lord and lady are with the body now padraig informed us abbot emlyn is saying prayers poor soul sighed rhona was anyone with him when he died i was at his bedside my lady the monk answered he did not awaken from his sleep i thought to rouse him at sunset to give him a drink of the potion but his spirit had flown we went in to find a veritable crowd around the dead mans bed servingmen and maids mostly a few vassals and half a dozen monks in attendance with emlyn they were standing with their heads bowed hands folded as the good abbot softly intoned the prayers for the soul of the newly departed rhona and i came to stand behind the monks and listened until emlyn concluded his prayer whereupon the brothers arranged themselves in order around the dead mans bed raised it and began carrying it from the hall moving to my fathers side i said i am sorry hes gone i cannot help feeling we should have done more for him murdo shook his head he wanted nothing from us in his life but to be allowed to die in peace as he asked so he was given he appeared about to say more but turned away abruptly following the monks out into the yard my mother laid her hand on my sleeve as she passed by there is an end to all things she whispered giving my arm a comforting squeeze let this also end i wondered at her words and would have asked her what she meant but she moved on quickly and rhona came up beside me it is sad she sighed only a few days ago no one cared whether he was alive or dead i reminded her nothing much has changed rhona looked sideways at me but everything has changed she said women i think feel these things differently i do not pretend to understand them torfs body was taken to the nearby monastery where it was washed and wrapped in a shroud of clean linen and prepared for burial i had long heard it saidand now know it to be truethat the roman church is bereft in the face of death the rites attending a souls passing are solemn and severe the roman priests make no effort to lighten the burden of grief to be borne by the mourners it is almost as if they view death as a punishment for the audacity of having accepted the gifting givers boon of life or as the sorry and inevitable end of sinful flesh the cele de however see in death a friend whom the all wise has entrusted with delivering his children from the pain and travail of mortal existence into the eternal paradise of his gracious kingdom when bodies and hearts become too sick or broken to go on brother death comes to lead the suffering spirit away to its rightful home accordingly this journey is accompanied with laments and dirges for those left behind but with songs of praise and happiness also for the one who has gone ahead while the body was being prepared for burial murdo determined that a grave should be dug in the corner of the churchyard although as he said torfeinar had not been one of the lords better sheep he was still a member of the flock i offered to help with this chore but my father would not have it any other way but that he should dig the grave himself at dusk the corpse was brought out and borne to the gravesite in the churchyard where most of the settlements inhabitants had gathered the sun had set with a fine and radiant brilliance touching the clouds with fire and setting the sky alight in the golden twilight the linen grave clothes gleamed like rarest samite and the faces of both monks and mourners glowed we sang a lament for a departed warrior and then abbot emlyn led us in a psalm he said a prayer following which he invited those closest to the deceased to toss a handful of earth into the grave murdo stepped forwards picked up a fistful of dirt and let it fall and i followed his example i suppose despite our brief acquaintance i felt some innate kinship with torfeinar for all his profligate ways he was still part of the clan and we did for him what we would do for any family member we sang a psalm while the monks undertook to shovel the dirt into the grave the deep hole filled up quickly and a single flat stone with his name scratched onto it was raised upon the mounded earth whereupon we went back to the hall to drink and eat a meal in torfs memory as we reached the hall i glanced up and saw two stars shining over the steep thatched roof one for torf and one for skuli i decided in the same instant the monks began singing again and it seemed to me that the stars shined more brightly farewell torf i murmured to myself may it go well with you on your journey hence we feasted in torfeinars memory that night and after the ale had made several rounds murdo rose to his feet and spoke briefly of his brother he talked about their life together growing up in orkneyjar and his fathers love and admiration for his firstborn son i could not help noticing however that he breathed not a word of their sojourn in the holy land by that i knew the old wound had been reopened in my fathers heart that night rhona and i clung to one another in our bed exulting in our loving and celebrating the life running strong in us next day the mundane chores of the settlement resumed the awaited ship arrived with its cargo of cut stone and we began the sweaty task of unloading the ship and dragging the heavy blocks up to the site of the new church murdo put as many men to the chore as could be spared from other duties but it was hard labour still by days end we were well exhausted each and every one and torfs death and funeral were of no more account than the ripple of a pebble tossed into the sea as the weeks passed however i found myself thinking about some small thing or other torf had told me about the holy land once i asked murdo for further explanation but he just told me that whatever torf had said was best forgotten the ramblings of a sick man he declared flatly he is dead and that is that i will not speak of it again of course this only served to increase my appetite the more all through the rest of the summer and the harvest season i fairly itched for some word of the great pilgrimage and its many battles but little enough came my way no one on the estate or any of the other settlements had taken the cross or made the journeysave abbot emlyn and murdo when i asked the good abbot what happened in the holy land to make my father so closemouthed on the subject he replied one day perhaps he will feel like talking about it no doubt it is for the best towards the end of harvest that year rhona told me that our childmaking efforts had borne fruit also we were to have a baby in the spring i remember cait looking at you when my lovely lady wife told me the glad news you were sitting by the hearth stirring a bowl of water with a wooden spoon which your mother had given you so you could cook with her did you hear little one i shouted you are to have a brother oh i was so certain the child would be a boy and i would have a son at last we dreamed this happy dream all through the long cold winter as rhonas belly swelled she often remarked she had never carried a child so large and heavya sure sign that a manchild would be born in the spring at winters end we awaited the appointed time eagerly one morning we awakened to the sound of the snow melting from the roof into puddles below the deep overhanging eaves i felt rhona stir beside me and turned to find her watching me did you sleep well my heart i asked how am i to sleep she replied this son of yours gives me no rest at all he kicks and squirms the whole night through placing a hand to the bulging dome of her round stomach i said it is only because he is eager to come out and meet his family it is because he is his stubborn fathers son she replied sweetly stroking my hair with her fingertips little cait awakened and scampered into bed with us she snuggled down between us and proceeded to wave her feet in the air while singing a song about a fish it was a fine and happy moment with my best beloved and i revelled in it looking back now i cherish it all the moreknowing the dark unendurable days which lay ahead four the birth pangs came on her early the next morning but rhona continued with her ordinary chores until midday when the pains grew severe i ran to alert my lady mother who came with one of the older women of the settlement who often served as midwife and one of her servingmaids to help they took matters in hand and ragna sent me off to the church to help murdo with the building promising to fetch me as soon as the birth drew near i was still there when ingrid the servingmaid came running a short while later lord duncan you must hurry what i said climbing down from the scaffolding is my son born already my lady said you were to come as fast as you can she replied wringing her hands in her apron i took her by the shoulders to steady her tell me what has happened it is your lady wife she said oh please come now hurry my father heard the commotion below and called down to know what was happening i explained quickly and he sent me off saying he would find abbot emlyn and follow as soon as he could i raced down the hill to the dun through the gate into the yard and to our house there were several women standing outside the door i pushed through them and went in ragna met me at the bedside her face grave and sad there is not much time my son she said softly taking my hand she wanted to see you i heard the words but could make no sense of what she was saying what is wrong mother the birth has torn something inside rhona she replied gently she will not live bbut i stammered but she will be well and the childwe were going to there will be time to speak later she said leading me towards the bed pluck up your courage my son and go to your wife i stepped to the side of the bed and rhona her face greywhite with the pallor of death opened her eyes and smiled weakly i stared in disbelief only a short while ago that same lovely face had been glowing with love and life how was it possible that such a change could occur so swiftly she lifted a finger and motioned me closer i bent to place my ear near her lips so sorry my soul she said her voice the merest breath of a whisper i tried to get a son for you shh i whispered trying to soothe rest now we will talk about it later i love you she said her lips barely moving kiss me i pressed my lips to hersthey were dry as husks and cold farewell my heart she sighed a tremor passed through her body i took her hand and clasped it tight her breath went out in a long slow exhalation and she lay still farewell i said my throat closing on the word as the tears came i raised her hand to my lips and held it there then i took her in my arms for the last tune i bent my head and put my face next to hers and held her closeuntil i felt my mothers hands on my shoulders drawing me gently away i allowed myself to be gathered into my mothers embrace and we stood for a time motionless while she spoke words of comfort and courage to me abbot emlyn and my father arrived then the abbot stepped into the room and discerned instantly what had happened his round shoulders slumped and his cheerful face dissolved in misery murdo rushed to the bedside as if he would command the life back into rhonas dear body only when he beheld the stark white skin and her empty upward gaze was he persuaded that there was nothing to be done he turned to ragna and me put his arm on my shoulder duncan my son he said drawing me close i am so sorry we three stood there together for a time our tears flowing freely abbot emlyn stepped forwards and began the rites for the dead stretching his hands over the stillwarm body he began chantingnot in latin or greek but in the ancient and honorable tongue of the celtsasking the swift sure hand to enfold the soul of my best beloved and guide her swiftly to her eternal home then he folded rhonas hands over her breast straightened her limbs and told the servingwomen to find rhonas finest clothes to me he said god has called his faithful daughter to join him in paradise tonight we will sing a lament for the empty place she leaves behind tomorrow we will celebrate her life and rejoice in her receiving her justlyearned reward look your last upon her dear friend and i will return in a little while to take the body away and prepare it for burial i looked at him in dismay so soon i thought why does it have to be so soon but i said nothing merely nodding my assent instead emlyn left and i turned once more to the bed already she seemed more at ease the pinched tightness of her features had relaxed and she appeared to be sleeping peacefully for a fleeting instant my heart leapt up with joy i felt like shouting see it has all been a dreadful mistake she lives rhona is with us still but no released from the pains of death her body was taking on something of its natural calm stooping over her i brushed the damp strands of hair from her face and kissed her forehead go with god my soul i said straightening it was then that i saw the small still form beside her wrapped in swaddling clothes looking like little more than a lump in the bed was the tiny body of my son darkhaired his small face clenched like a fist against a world he would never know he lay beside his mother i beheld the body and felt my own dear mother beside me the little one did not draw breath she told me there was nothing to be done i nodded and rested my hand on his still chestmy hand almost covered his whole body god bless you my son may we meet one day in blessed jesus court we waited with the bodies until the monks came to take them away to the monastery i could not bring myself to accompany them nor take part in the preparations instead i went down to the sea and walked along the beach until nightfall and emlyn sent brother padraig to fetch me back to the hall there is food and drink prepared he told me and everyone is waiting no i replied harshly go back and tell them to eat without me master duncan he said gently so mild and compassionate in his reproof i had not the heart to refuse him again and so allowed myself to be led back to the hall upon entering glanced around quickly and niniane was the first person i happened to see she stepped swiftly towards me and folded me into her arms dear dear duncan she sighed i am so sorry so very sorry i allowed myself to be consoled for a moment and then asked how is it you are here i was on my way to the abbey i arrived in time to help prepare the her body lost in my grief i had not been aware of the comings or goings around me is eirik with you she shook her head there was some trouble in inbhir ness the son of a visiting nobleman accidentally killed a local chieftains son the clan has sworn a blood oath and the unlucky boy has taken sanctuary at the monastery eirik thought it best to stay on until matters were resolved niniane regarded me sadly rhona was a good friend to me and i will try to be as good a friend to you i will help in any way i can i thanked her kindly and escorted her to the table where the food was being served they had saved a place for me at the board beside my mother who was holding little gait in her lap you dear heart unaware of the sombre proceedings held out your hands to me and wanted me to play with you but i could not i merely sat and gazed glumly at your happy little face deaf to your childish pleadings all i could think was that i would gladly change places with my poor dead wife it was my fault after all if i had not been so insistent on having a son my beloved rhona would still be alive i would be sitting next to her it would be her face her bright eyes i was gazing into now it would be rhonas hand reaching to take mine there was singing that night but i remember almost nothing of it emlyn sang a lament as i recall and some of the women of the settlement likewise sang and padraig played the harp but my mind like my heart was with my beloved lying cold and alone on her bier in the church and i drew no consolation from the kindly expressions of those around me a more wretched man there never was than myself that night when at last everyone departed for their beds i left the hall too i thrashed around in my empty bed for a time and at last unable to rest i rose and walked the clifftops above the dark restless sea until morning following the death service in the old wooden church we buried rhona in the new churchyard she would have approved of her final resting place i think as there was a plum thicket growing nearby and she was always fond of plums i was the last to leave the yard i knelt a long time by that mound of stones gathered from the beach wondering how i could go on living when my light my life lay under that heap of earth and rock the next days brought no solace i went about my various chores with dull efficiency a man bereft of all hope and life seeing no good thing hearing no kindly word taking joy in nothing around me at night i roamed the clifftops my wretched condition persisted until i could bear it no more one night with the moon shining full in the yard i rose and went out my feet found the familiar path leading down to the shore heartsick weary with grief i walked down onto the beach and out into the sea god help me i could endure the gnawing ache no longer i felt the cold water surge around my knees but i kept walking if i had any thought at all it was that the pain would soon be over and i would be with my beloved forever i felt the water rising around meto my thighs and then my waistyet still i walked on and would have gone on walking but as the black water swirled around my chest i heard a voice call out to me from the shore duncan wait i recognized the voice it was padraig not to be dissuaded i paid no heed to the call but struggled ahead in all determination in a moment i heard the splash of footsteps in the water as padraig pursued me not wishing to be caught or dissuaded from the course before me i made no answer and pushed deeper into the water duncan he shouted here duncan i have something for you ignoring him i continued on the water was up to my throat and the swell of the waves tugged at me raising me off my feet he shouted after me again and then i heard another voice a childs voice frightened crying casting a backward glance over my shoulder i saw him striding after me holding caitriona in his arms so unexpected was the sight of her i stopped and turned around what do you mean by this i shouted get her away from here he waded nearer and dearest gait your tiny face was twisted in fear and your hands were reaching out to me to help you to save you from the water and the night and the strangeness of what was happening come now padraig called would you leave without saying farewell to your daughter better still why not take her with you stretching his arms he held the child out to me take her back to shore you fool i shouted angrily he merely shook his head i glared at him have you gone mad here he said holding her out to me again gait began to shriek as the cold water splashed around her legs take her now and make an end of it it will be a kindness you are mad i growled perhaps he allowed still it would be better i think to have died in the arms of your loving father than to lose both parents before you are old enough to remember either of them as you mean to end your life so be it you might as well end her life too enraged i strode forwards and snatched the dear babe from his arms stupid priest you know nothing about children true he agreed placidly but i know this water is freezing and night is far gone and i miss my warm bed could we go back now do you think cradling my squalling child in my arms i started towards the shore we walked back to the dun in silence gait had ceased crying by the time we reached the house padraig bade me farewell and i went in wrapped my darling girl in one of her mothers warm mantles and put her in her bed i sat with her until she was asleep i slept as well and woke the next morning when i heard voices outside thinking padraig must have told someone what had taken place in the night i grew embarrassed and went outside to face the stares of disapproval and reproach but it was just some women from the settlement coming to bring me and little caitriona some food they gave me the baskets and departed saying how they would be glad to help look after the bairn whenever i needed them the women went their way then but all day long i kept thinking someone would mention the previous nights incident no one did after vespers that evening i saw padraig leaving the chapel and went to thank him for not breathing a word to anyone about my shameful behaviour of the night before he looked at me curiously behaviour what shameful behaviour could that be he said you know i muttered irritated that he would make me speak it out so bluntly i went walking down by the sea how very strange he said mildly his face betraying no hint of guile i too went walking in my sleep last night now try as i might i can remember very little about it leaning close he said between ourselves i would consider it a kindness if you would not tell the abbot we are not supposed to leave the monastery after prayers well i told him you can trust me to keep your secret only see that it does not happen again oh i have repented of it a hundred times already he gave me a look of shrewd appraisal i do not think i will have occasion to sleepwalk again that concluded the matter and nothing else was ever said either by padraig or anyone else let me tell you i also have repented of that night a hundred times since then nevertheless god is good out of that disgraceful incident he brought a friendship which is beyond all price for from that night padraig became my dearest companion and spiritual advisormy anam cam as he calls it my soul friend another result of that nights folly was that i began to consider what i might do to make amends for my cowardly lapsea selfimposed penance while some might consider it overly pious or even rank sanctimony let them think what they will i know how close i came to throwing away gods inestimable gift that night had i drowned myself cait i would have condemned myself to an eternity of misery that i know instead the gifting giver has blessed me beyond measure though i sit in splendoured captivity awaiting the death decree i am yet the most grateful of men for having known the love of true friends and the graceful happy child that is my daughter and for having been allowed to dare and do much for the advancement of my saviours invisible kingdom ah well make of it what you will whatever the workings of the mysterious inner heart i began to contemplate some mighty work of atonement that i might do as i pondered on what form this great deed might take i found release from the shock and sorrow of my rhonas sad death my zeal and appetite for life returned and along with it a fresh desire for the things of the spirit padraig noticed my newfound devotion one night after vespers while we talked together over a bowl of ale he said beware duncan you will be wanting to become a priest next what would be wrong with that i replied defiance hardening my voice do you think it above me my brother is a priest remember i know well enough what would be required i could i surrender he held up his hands i spoke in jest you would make a fine priest of that i have no doubt despite his words i heard the reservation in his tone and yet he put out his lip and regarded me thoughtfully but made no reply come now what is in your mind far be it from me to discourage anyone from seeking the priesthood and yet you would discourage mehey well that is a fine thing you misunderstand he said quickly there are many priests among the cele de but few noblemen our lord has blessed you richly duncan if you would do something to honour him let it be in the manner whereby he has created you as a nobleman you mean he spread his hands look at all your father has accomplished for the good of the cele de do you imagine it would be half so much if he had been a monk a trifling thing a few simple words lightly spoken but it started me thinking in a new way i thought about what my father had done as a young manmuch younger than myself he was when he followed the great pilgrimage these thoughts grew to fill my every waking moment and soon i could think of nothing else could it be i wondered that i too was being called to join the pilgrim way some few nights later i happened to mention my musings to my father we were at table for our evening meal as always in murdos hall there were a number of vassals and friends gathered around the board some of the stonemasons working on the new church had been invited to sup with us that night so the ale and conversation flowed liberally talk turned to torfeinars return and how he had fared in the holy land someone said he had heard that torf left an enormous fortune in the east and others began speculating on how much this unknown wealth could be and whether it was in gold or silver their ignorance and frivolity vexed me and i said perhaps i will go to the holy land myself and claim this fortune and become king of edessa my mother directing the servingboys and listening to the table talk with but half an ear turned to me as if i had said i meant to burn down the hall with everyone in it the smile on my fathers face vanished in an instant his head turned slowly towards me if i had uttered the most obscene blasphemy imaginable i do not think his expression could have been more aghast he swallowed the bit of bread he was chewing forcing down his growing anger that was illspoken he said his voice strained and low idle fancies are the work of the devil i started to object that it was no idle fancy that i had been considering just such an undertaking but i glimpsed lady ragna desperately trying to warn me off their reaction rankled me truly yet the swiftness and force with which my innocent comment roused my lords wrath took me aback i mumbled a vague apology and begged his pardon the tension of the moment melted away and talk resumed but nothing more was said about the holy land when the opportunity presented itself i rose and left the hall when i arrived at the church the next morning my father took me aside your mother thinks i was too quick to judge you last night she thinks i condemned you out of hand for a comment worth less than the breath to speak it i looked him in the eye what do you think lord he glanced away i think my good wife is wise and over the years i have learned that her opinions in such matters are to be trusted he shrugged and his eyes swung back to me if you tell me she has rightly divined the heart of the thing and promise me you will never speak of such things again i will forgive you fully and freely and say no more about it forgive i said my voice harsh with outrage is it a sin now to speak of the holy land as surely as i am your son my lord i will think and speak as i please he glared at me only a fool jests about things he does not understand i never knew you for a fool boy lest i say something i would later regret i turned and started away there is another possibility i said looking back over my shoulder and what is that he growled after me it was no jest his unreasoning obstinance hardened my determination i confess i found myself dwelling on the things torfeinar had told me regarding the holy land and imagining what it would be like to go there i did not work at the building that day instead i spent the day out in a boat beyond the headlands with three of the vassals catching mackerel for the smokehouse as the fishing was good we did not return until it was almost dark and then spent half the night gutting the fish so they would be ready for the drying racks in the morning indeed i was busy tying the flayed and split mackerel to the birch poles when abbot emlyn approached me so my father has sent you to chastise me i said mockingly no doubt he has grown tired of shouldering the burden all by himself the kindly cleric looked at me and sighed you are that much like another young man i once knew he said stubborn as stone if you are looking for the cause of the trouble i told him you come looking in the wrong place the fault lies not with me but with my lord come he said motioning me to his side walk with me i had it in me to refuse im busy i told him come with me duncan he insisted gently the fish can wait who can resist the kindly abbot anything thus i found myself falling into step beside him we walked across the yard and out from the caer our footsteps found the track down to the sea and so we followed it passing the field where some of the vassals were chopping thistles the breeze was out of the north and i could smell the clean windwashed air faintly tinged with salta sign of cool bright weather to come we came onto the pebbled shingle and walked for a time the sound of our feet crunching in the stones made a hollow sound tiny white crabs swarmed the rotting seaweed at the high tide mark darting out of sight as we passed at last the abbot drew a long breath and said i am disturbed duncan i thought i knew what he would say next i waited for the rebuke and prepared to defend myself against his unjustified disapproval murdo is not himself this so surprised me i stopped walking and turned to him what your father and i have been friends for many years but i have never known him to be this contrary and shorttempered nor i for the life of me i cannot think what has happened to make him so disagreeable and changeable yes the abbot agreed lord murdo is the steadiest and most resolute of men it hurts me to see him more miserable by the day he looked at me distress furrowing his forehead what can he be afraid of do you think why afraid i said dismissing the question i have never known my father to be afraid of anything i think he is just getting set in his ways and resents anyone else having a different opinion emlyn shook his head gently you know that is not true i suppose not i allowed but why do you say he is afraid look deep enough and you will find that fear is usually at the bottom of all our sins and failings he is afraid i will go to the holy land i had not intended saying that indeed the words were out before i had even considered them even so i knew them to be true the moment i heard them emlyn did not disagree why should he be afraid of that do you think because i began slowly he thinks i will become like torfeinar and forsake my family and my birthright perhaps it is something like that the cleric replied we resumed walking the breeze ruffled the waves as they lapped at the stones making a sound like chuckling your father never speaks of the great pilgrimage emlyn continued after a moment no he does not for your father the great pilgrimage brought nothing but hardship and grief like many others murdo lost nearly everything he cherished in life ever since he returned he has worked at replacing all that he lost and he has succeeded admirably well torfeinars return reminded him of this i mused more than that the abbot assured me if torf had not returned the past would have remained only a memorypainful though it may be i began to see what he was telling me murdo is afraid i will go to the holy land and he will lose me too all things considered it is not an unreasonable fear he looked at me but i kept my eyes straight ahead so i would not have to meet his gaze i see so you are united with him in this it is not like that duncan what if i were to tell you that god was calling me to undertake the pilgrimage myself how would you counsel me then he did not reply at once and so i thought i had him at my mercy i boldly pressed my advantage well abbot i demanded obey my father or obey godwhich is it to be when he did not answer i glanced across at him and saw that he was squinting into the distance as his eyes searched the faroff sea haze on the horizon there is a ship he told me someone is coming where i quickly scanned the horizon there he said pointing to a patch of bright water out beyond the headland who could it be i wonder we watched as the tiny speck grew slowly larger it was a sizeable ship with red sails speeding swiftly towards us on the landward breeze all at once the answer came to me eirik a moment later we were both hurrying back along the path towards the dun to alert the others that my brother had finally returned five that night we welcomed eirik home with a modest feast and sat him in the place of honour at table he was happy to be back in gods country he said and far away from the southern scots and their interminable squabbles you would think common dignity the rarest most valuable substance in all the world the way they ward and worry over it he said and if any of them ever get any of the stuff why he is the most miserable man you ever saw for he must be on constant guard lest anyone besmirch it with a careless word too true concurred emlyn ruefully i once heard of a man from dunedin who killed a beggar for stepping on his shadow are they all so contentious in the south said ragna if that is so i never want to go there what say you murdo asked one of the masons you and abbot emlyn have been further south than anyone hereabouts are the fellows so bloodthirsty as that murdo glared at the man for raising the question worse he muttered ominously and though the men asked for a story he bluntly refused to say more eirik marked his fathers bad manners but wisely passed on to other matters he asked the mason about the new church which was beginning to resemble something more than just a heap of rubble on bare ground this proved a durable subject and we finished the meal with a retelling of the work almost stone by stone after supper eirik came to me and expressed his sorrow at hearing of rhonas sad death i accepted his condolences and he asked what has happened to father while i was away a bear with a sore head growls less is he feeling well he is well enough i allowed a ghost has returned to haunt him eirik raised his eyebrows at this and begged me to say more i told him about torfeinars untimely return and his lingering death i begin to see now replied eirik the old wounds are reopened that is exactly what emlyn says i replied myself i think the two of them have a secret this intrigued eirik and it flattered me to have my elder brother hanging on my every word so i continued recklessly indeed i said i think something happened while they were on the great pilgrimage togethersomething they have forbidden one another ever to mention aloud although i was speaking out of utter ignorance i had struck closer to the truth than anyone could have known emlyn keep a secret wondered eirik it must be something terrible indeed oh aye i said carelessly whatever dark deed it conceals has reared its head once more and it has made our fathers life a misery ever since and it was something to do with torf you say asked eirik perhaps i replied but that is not what i said rather it was something torf said what did he say why he spoke of many things mostly it was to do with his life in the holy landhis battles and treasures and the like father would not listen to him he called it travellers tales and dangerous nonsense did he now eirik pondered this for a moment then asked tell me brother was murdo vexed from the first or might there have been a particular moment when his disposition changed from the very first i told him from the moment he clapped eyes to torfeinar he was i halted as it occurred to me what my brother was really asking no now that i think about it i said considering the matter more completely it was when torf began talking about the relics this intrigued eirik which relics he asked leaning forwards his expression keen the holy lance and the black rood it was when i asked our lord about those two relics that he grew angry he would never listen to anything torf had to say about them he said it was all lies and he refused to hear a word of it when i asked emlyn about it he declined to tell me anything he told me it was not for him to say a very mystery said eirik already i could see the plot forming in his mind and likely to remain a mystery there is no power on earth to make lord murdo change his mind true allowed eirik pursing his lips and nodding we shall see we shall see my elder brother is tireless when it comes to achieving the unobtainable tell him a thing is impossible or impracticalbetter still impossible and impracticaland that is the thing he wants nothing else will do his ceaseless energy knows no impediment no restraint no limit as a boy growing up i watched him lavish the utmost of his strength and effort on all manner of hopeless enterprises do not think i judge him overharshly cait he would be the first to admit it you only have to ask him and he will tell you he glories in it all the more so because every now and then he succeeds as much to his own amazement as anyones one of his impossible achievements was gaining a bishopric at an age when most priests are only beginning to entertain the possibility of becoming an abbot another was niniane if you want to hear the tale of that courtship cait ask your gracious aunt it is a tale well worth hearing over the next few days eirik went to work on the problem i could see him thinking about it as he attended his priestly duties he schemed well into the autumn with it had i not known my brother i might have imagined he had forgotten about it not at all he was only waiting for the best possible moment to pounce you see he was up against a man whose capacity for daring the impossible exceeds even his own lord murdo ranulfson himself no doubt eirik believed that if his chance was squandered it would surely never come again true enough but the swift sure hand was already moving to bring about its own inscrutable purposes as you shall see just after harvest eirik left the abbey and went to make a circuit of the realm he took four brothers with him loaded a few supplies and trade goods on a horse and set off he was gone but three days when he returned abruptly saying he had had a vision everyone gathered around to hear what had taken place we were camped beside a stream he told us and i was tending the fire while the brothers prepared our porridge i was bending to the flames when i heard someone calling to us from the nearby wood i looked around and asked the brothers who it could be for all we were far from any settlement but they heard nothing i waited a little and the voice called out again and yet once more did these good brothers hear a sound no they never did here the bishop said ask themtheyll tell you what did you hear demanded one of the vassals we did not hear anything at all replied the monks and while i was considering what this might mean a man came out of the wood he was dressed all in white and he called me by name when i hailed our visitor and pointed him out to the brothers here they could not see him we never did see him confessed the clerics we neither saw nor heard anything at all the vassals agog at this wonder turned in wideeyed amazement to one another and i began to smell a rat strange to say however i noticed that murdo had grown very quiet and now wore a most thoughtful expression on his face this stranger asked me to walk with him and truth to tell i did not want to go eirik said but he said fear nothing brother no harm will come to you so i said who are you lord for i thought it might be an angel speaking to me oh aye murmured the vassals knowingly as if they were well used to conversing with angels eirik raised his hands for quiet and continued the stranger looked at me and said i am a friend and well known to your family and i did not know what to say to this how can this be i ask i have never seen you before this brings a smile to my strange visitors lips brother eirik he says to me for he knows my name as i say come i must be about my business he turned and walked a little away from the camp and bade me to follow i did and he said the day is coming when the church your father builds will be my home tell murdo to look for me i agree to deliver the message and ask what name shall i give him and this is the strangest part of all for the stranger merely raised his hand in farewell and replied tell him the lord of the promise is well pleased with his servant and then eirik concluded he disappeared into the wood the way he had come the vassals gabbled in astonishment and when it was certain the bishop had no more to tell them they went away shaking their heads in awe of this miraculous occurrence i have delivered the message father eirik said what does it mean it was yourvision murdo replied sharply you tell me with that he turned on his heel and walked quickly away the bishop sent his monks along to the abbey and i walked with eirik to the hall that was well done i told him when we were alone how did you find out about the white priest he stopped in midstep and turned to me how did you know he was a priest he demanded you must have said it just now i said nothing about that he insisted adamantly and i felt a sudden tingle raise the hairs on my arms was he a priest i asked you know very well that he was eirik said but i kept that part of my tale back on purpose you have had it from someone else and so have you i accused i know what youre trying to do the vassals may be gulled by your talk of visions in the night but i am not i doubt murdo will be taken in by it either eirik regarded me with a look of exasperated pity duncan duncan what are you saying do you think i made up a tale is that what you think of course you did i told him it is nothing to me one way or the other but he rolled his eyes and shook his head what are you telling me now it was true in the name of all that is holy it is the very truth he declared it happened just as i told it why would i concoct such a tale to discover the secret the light of understanding broke over my brother just then murdo and emlyns secretis that what you mean you believe i made up a story to try to draw them into confession yes i admitted that is what i thought and i hope it works too brother replied eirik with a smile you are far more devious than i imagined i do believe you have the guile of the young lord murdo himself about you and no mistake but surely as god is my witness he vowed earnestly it happened just as i said very well i allowed accepting him at his word but will it work do you think it might replied eirik thoughtfully tapping his lower lip with a fingertip we will have to be shrewd about it say nothing to either of them leave it with me i think i know a way we parted company then and he hurried off to the abbey when i called after him soon he answered leave it with me that night at supper eirik came to the table dourfaced and grim of aspect he said little and stared at his food as if he suspected poison when anyone spoke to him all they received was a cheerless nod or a halfhearted grunt his doleful humour so permeated the meal that conversation ceased halfway through and people began to speak in furtive whispers so as not to disturb the melancholy cleric murdo as host of the meal at first tried to ignore his sons gloomy demeanour when at last that became impossible he finally gave in and asked is it ill you are you seem to have the weight of the world around your neck eirik raised his eyes slowly as if contemplating at the cause of all human misery take no thought for me father he intoned solemnly the weight i bear is mine alone is there nothing we can do for you my son asked lady ragna i fear not he said with a heavy sigh the vision was given to me and it sickens inside me ere i discern its meaning this i will do though i fear the effort will drive me to madness he rose from the bench and made to depart i am sorry i should not have come to table tonight i have spoiled a good meal and beg your forgiveness my lord he made a bow towards mother my lady i wish you a good night a glance passed between the lady and lord ragna urged her husband with her eyes wait said murdo calling eirik back there may be a remedy for your ills come back and sit down eat something i will summon the abbot and we will talk when you are feeling better my lord said eirik resuming his place once more dare i hope that you know something to help put my mind at rest perhaps allowed murdo perhaps but this is not the place to discuss it eat something son recover your appetite if you can and the abbot will be here shortly murdo dispatched one of the servingboys to fetch the abbot and the meal continued in a more convivial spirit than before eirik i noticed recovered his appetite wonderfully well by the time abbot emlyn arrived my brother was well into his third barley loaf and second bowl of stew the ample abbot settled at the board declining an offering of meat but accepting a bowl of brown ale the other guests eager to learn the outcome of the curious affair fell silent and all eyes turned towards the head of the table good abb began murdo somewhat uncomfortably it seems our bishop has been suffering for the sake of his extraordinary vision indeed replied emlyn turning sympathetic eyes on the young churchman i would that you had come to me my friend what is the matter eirik explained briefly whereupon emlyn turned to murdo if this is not a sign from our lord and saviour i do not know what it can be it was my thought too replied murdo he stood and called to the servingboy bring a jar of ale to my treasure room turning to his other guests i beg you forgive our absence friends this matter is best discussed in private please linger as long as you like my lady wife will see the jars remain filled with that the three of them rose from the board and started from the hall those left at table were suddenly stricken with the knowledge that they were to be left out of the discussion and never discover the mysterys resolution i include myself in that number for i was not invited to share their private deliberations i watched them walk away and felt a mighty disappointment pinch me hard the meal ended and the guests drifted away i sat for a time with my mother glumly watching the fire on the hearth and feeling as forlorn as a hound banished from my masters side haldi the servingboy appeared after awhile with the jars of ale ragna called to him as he moved towards the door at the far end of the hall bring the tray to me haldi she said he came and lay the tray on the table she dismissed him saying they will be some time at their talk i think help cook in the kitchen and then you can go to bed i will see to the lords ale haldi thanked her and ran off glad at the prospect of finishing his chores early rising then my mother yawned and said i have grown tired myself and believe i will go to bed perhaps you would not mind undertaking this duty duncan by all means my lady i replied i am only too happy to oblige she kissed me on the cheek and i bade her good night then so as not to waste another moment i snatched up the tray and hastened off to the treasure room where the mystery of eiriks vision was being revealed six the treasure room is a small chamber in the centre of the house with no windows and but a single low door its walls are good solid stone and very thick it was i believe the first part of the house to be constructed and all the restthe sleeping rooms stores workrooms kitchen and hall was built around it many an eastern potentate has such a room i have learned but few noblemen in the north the reason is that such wealth as men possess in the wild northlands resides in the land itselfthe fields cattle grazing land and the like murdo owns wealth like this in abundance to be sure but he also possesses a treasure that would make many a king grow heartsick with envy if the full extent of it were ever known murdo has ever been circumspect about his treasure he never speaks of it and seldom even visits the room wherein it is housed once as a boy of six or seven summers i sneaked the great iron key from its hiding place and waited until everyone was about some other chore and then let myself in to see what i might find the room itself was even to my childish eye small and low there was a table in the centre of the room with one chair and a candletree with halfburnt candles there were four large oaken chestsone on each walland each chest was bound in broad iron bands which were likewise locked i had no keys for any of the locks but the discovery of those chests proved almost as exciting as an entire silver hoard i put my eye to the centre lock of the largest chest and beheld the dusky glimmer of gold within footsteps outside the door prevented me from carrying out similar examinations of the three remaining chests but that solitary glimpse was enough to fuel my fevered imaginings for many days afterwards ah but the truth gait is more marvellous by far one day you will see for yourself that night however the treasure was far from my thoughts i entered the low candlelit room with the jars of ale and before anyone remarked on my presence began filling the bowlsas if this were my usual chore i filled emlyns first then moved on to eiriks and lastly to murdos cup he thanked me and then recollected himself and asked what had become of haldi i replied that the lady had sent him to help the cook and asked me to serve in his stead since you are here eirik said yu might as well stay and hear this the suggestion sat ill with my lord i could tell he was on the point of refusing when abbot emlyn spoke up yes let duncan stay do you think it wise asked murdo doubtfully he must know the truth the abbot declared if he is to serve it yes let him stay his words sent a thrill of excitement through me was there more to this than i guessed murdo held his frown for a moment longer and we all waited for him to make up his mind very well he relented at last so be it he directed me to close the door and sit down i did as he asked and settled atop the great oak chest i had tried to peek into years before we have been speaking of your brothers vision my father told me what i am about to say is known only to three other people in all the world emlyn my old friend is one of them your mother is the other he paused then as if uncertain how to continue speak it out emlyn exhorted gently it is for the best i do believe murdo nodded turning to eirik he said a long time ago when i was a young manlittle more than a boyi too saw the white priest this surprised me twice he added once in antioch and once in jerusalem he appeared to me and asked me to build him a kingdom murdo paused remembering and added with a wave of his hand to signify not only the house and caer but the lands and fields of the settlement beyond this i have tried my best to do the promise said eirik he said the lord of the promise was pleased he has found favour with your efforts my lord murdo nodded thoughtfully many things happened in the holy land and most of them are best forgotten though i have remained true to the vow i made i had lately begun to think i would not live to see it fulfilled indeed i had not thought to hear from him again until today said eirik until today confirmed murdo forgive me lord i said but who is this white priest is he a phantom perhaps replied my father he might be an angel i cannot say he told me his name was andrew and he appeared in the form of a monk at least he looked like one to me he paused remembering then added indeed although i did not know it i believe he guided me through all that followedevery step of the way from that day to this murdo went on to explain how he had been deep in the catacombs of the monastery of the church of saint mary outside the walls of jerusalem when he had his second encounter with the white priest i was alone for just a moment waiting for the others to return and he appeared to me murdo explained his voice taking on a softer edge as his mind took him back through the years to that portentous meeting we talked and he asked me to serve him i asked what he wanted me to do and he said he wanted me to build him a kingdom where his sheep could safely graze he said make it far far away from the ambitions of smallsouled men and their ceaseless striving make it a kingdom where the true path can be followed in peace and the holy light can shine as a beacon flame in the night you see said murdo with a slightly embarrassed smile i have remembered every word of it all these years was that the first time you heard of the true path i asked not at all replied murdo surprised at the question it was emlyn here who told me ronan and fionnyou remember them you and eirik met them once or twice when you were boysalso instructed me although at the time i took little of what they said to heart i hated priestsand with good reasonas many will tell you then this is even more remarkable than i knew said eirik how so asked emlyn the cele de have always been the guardians of the true path and keepers of the holy light and so i truly believe replied my brother adamantly but today a man appeared to me in a vision and told me that he was coming here to live why does everyone seem to know about the white priest but me i have never spoken of it before now said murdo nor has emlyn who else could possibly know eirik put out his hand towards me duncan knows he said and told them about our conversation earlier that day is this true duncan murdo asked and i confessed that it was how did you come by this knowledge torfeinar told me before he died i answered and related what he had said about the sacred relics and their mysterious guardian torf said the white priest appeared to the pilgrims in antioch and told them to dig in the church to find the lance of the crucifixion spreading my hands in a profession of innocence i added i had no way of knowing it was part of any secret abbot emlyn had grown very quiet and thoughtful he regarded murdo with a look of kindly reproach my father becoming increasingly agitated finally burst out very well thrusting a hand at the abbot he said if it will put an end to your pestering i will tell them everything so saying he moved to one of the chests and i thought he meant to unlock it instead he slid one of the iron bands to one side and withdrew a long rod with a flattened hook at one end my curiosity increased as he walked to the centre of the chamber and selected a flagstone on the floor slipping the hooked end of the rod into the crack between the stones he quickly prised it up and lifted it away kneeling down he reached into a stonelined cavity and pulled out a long thin bundle bound in leather which he brought to the table and began unwrapping eirik and i gathered close to see what it could be and emlyn stepped to the table standing with his hands clasped a look of rapture on his round face beneath the leather was a layer of fine linen and beneath that another my heart beat fast as the last wrap was pulled away to reveal a length of old pitted iron crooked with age and ruddytinted with rust from the way both murdo and emlyn reverenced the object i could see that it was a very valuable nay sacredthing but for the life of me i could not imagine what made it so i beheld the slender rod and my heart sank this this is the great secret they had protected these many years eirik on the other hand appeared dumbstruck he gave out a gasp and went down on his knees raising his hands and closing his eyes he then lowered his face to the floor and lay there in an attitude of prayer for his part murdo merely gazed on the object in silent wonder what is it i asked at last my father glanced at emlyn the abbot stretched out his hand and held it flat above the thing and said behold the iron lance i looked at it again less than a span in length and bowed in the middle it had an ugly stub of a blade at one end and a small hole at the other could this bit of scrap which i had taken for a fragment of broken hearthwarea piece of a spit for roasting meat say could it be the selfsame spear which had pierced the blessed saviours side if that is so i replied i wonder that the emperor himself is not camped outside our walls at this very moment or that the pope in rome has not made pilgrimage to pay homage watch your tongue boy warned murdo you stand very close to blasphemy and i will not hear it emlyn put out a conciliatory hand and said you promised to tell them everything turning to me he said a simple explanation will soon set your mind at ease duncan the reason we are left in peace with this inestimable treasure is that neither the pope nor the emperor nor anyone else in christendomknows we possess the holy lance for all the world knows the sacred relic resides in the treasury at constantinople that is what torfeinar believed i confirmed he told me that he was there the day prince bohemond gave the lance to the emperors envoy he said he saw it with his own eyes many people were there that day the abbot assured me i was one of them oh yes i was standing on the quay in jaffa harbour when bohemond arrived and i too saw him give the sacred lance to the emperors envoy dalassenus murdo allowed himself a small satisfied smile people do not always see what they think they see he said and taking up the jar he poured out some ale then emptied the bowl he then explained how this had come to be that night he revealed his longkept secret to usas he will tell you little cait when you are older why have you never spoken of this till now i asked when he finished if you had seen half of what i saw in jerusalem murdo replied you would not ask terrible it was cried abbot emlyn like wolves loosed among lambs they gorged themselves on the blood of the helpless their greed knew no restraintand what they could not carry off they destroyed the good abbot almost shaking with disgust bent his head and concluded sorrowfully they broke their vows and disgraced themselves before god and man they had the chance to show the world the benevolence of true christians instead of presenting themselves the best of men they behaved as the very worst after a moment he said this makes the task of the cele de all the more precious and important perhaps suggested eirik that is why the white priest is coming to make this his home no doubt reflected murdo no doubt syou are right about that he placed his hand reverently on the holy lance then picked it up and handed it to me my fingers closed on the length of old iron it was cold to the touch as you might expect and slightly heavier than it appeared beyond that there was nothing at all remarkable about it i passed the ancient weapon to eirik who bowed his head as he received it and said a prayer when he finished we bound the sacred relic in its linen and leather wrappings and replaced it in its hiding place beneath the floor that night i could not sleep for thinking about the strangeness of the tale i had heard all my life i had lived in that house and never once suspected it concealed one of the holiest objects the world has ever known what is more i had touched it and held it in my hands i thought about the western noblemen their greed and wickedness and the insufferable arrogance of the pope blithely sending so many thousands to their graves as i lay sleepless thinking these thoughts there kindled in me a righteous rage that such faithless men should hold sway over the poor and humble in their care then as restless night gave way to placid dawn i conceived the plan which for better or worse has led me to my fate seven i told no one of my plan i wanted to live with the decision for a time to let it grow and ripen if it would on the whole it is best not to rush headlong into schemes hatched in the dead of night daylight so often reveals the cracks that charmed night conceals and i had no wish to be foolhardy thus i went about my work in the usual way and no one was the wiser eirik resumed his circuit niniane joined the retinue this time and abbot emlyn undertook a journey to orkneyjar murdo threw himself into the building work making himself and everyone around him busy dawn to dusk we went about our chores amiably but never speaking of the things he had revealed that night or the marvellous treasure hidden in the centre of the house the days began to dull and the nights to lengthen work on the new church slowed as more often than not the labourers had to finish the days work by torchlight some of the masons would stay on with us through the winter to keep the worst ravages of gale and ice from undoing their efforts others however were growing anxious to return to their homes in the south they watched the skies and when orkneys geese started flying they flew too murdo had agreed to transport any who wished to leave to inbhir ness where they could get ships to take them home to eoforwik i went along mostly to help with the boat on the return while one man may sail a boat it is easier with two and my lord is very particular about his boat with sarn shortfinger at the tiller we made good speed down the coast it had been some time since i was last in inbhir ness and i looked forward to getting any news i could especially of the holy land since the weather was fair and appeared likely to remain that way for a few days i convinced sarn to stay a day in the town he agreed it would be no bad thing and once we had seen the stone masons settled aboard a ship leaving that night we walked along the harbour and talked to the sailors i found no one who had any word of the holy land but the harbour master said we might pay a call at one of the drinking halls fronting the quayside this we did but with no better result no one knew anything after our second hall and third bowl of ale sarn asked why do you want to know about the holy land have you never been curious sarn i was once he replied thoughtfully i wanted to know where the badger cub went he held out his hand and i saw that his middle finger was shorter than the others i found out and i was never curious after that he was quiet for a moment then added that is why the sea is better no badgers we finished our bowls and walked around the town to clear our heads i saw an old woman who was making shoes from lambskin and leather she had a small pair made for a child and adorned with little birds of red and blue thread cleverly sewn these i bought for my daughter they kept you warm all winter gait and i think you would be wearing them now if your feet had not grown too big there was a baker in the town also who made little hollow loaves of bread filled with spiced meat and turnips i bought two of these and some black bread and sausage for our supper we fetched a jar of ale from the hall at the quay before retiring to the boat for the night sarn and i ate our meal and listened to the talk of the sailors around us some of them got drunk and started to sing after awhile they left off singing and started fighting instead and three of them ended up in the water they were fished out by their shipmates and wandered off to find more to drink things grew more quiet after that so sarn and i rolled ourselves in our cloaks and went to sleep we left early the next morning and were at sea as the sun was rising on our return to banvard we beached the boat and staked it down for the winter murdo was glad the masons had found swift passage home as it would make them all the more eager to return next year this comment innocent as it undoubtedly was cast me into a despondent humour at first i thought i was merely disappointed that my efforts in inbhir ness had failed although it was not as if i had counted on learning anything of particular significance still i had hoped as the days darkened around me so darkened my mood i grew irritable and grumbled when people spoke to me i lashed out angrily at trifles and made myself miserable holding grudges for imagined slights one night i dreamed of rhona and the dream reawakened the grief i imagined was finished i began feeling her absence more acutely than ever i spent whole days staring at the fire while the wind whined in the eaves other times i walked out along the shore in the snow and sleet until my feet froze and my face turned blue i would start in my sleep and awake with the feeling that i was being strangled the queerness of it frightened me so that i refused to close my eyes when i lay down it was then i realized the source of my distress my plan had come to maturity but i was unwilling to face it having occupied myself with it from the feast of saint brighid to saint thomas mass it was time to begin doing something about it fearing the opposition my decision was certain to ignite i hesitated and this was the source of my misery my father would not welcome my decision this i knew nevertheless i resolved to announce my plan at the yuletide festivitiesimagining that any objection to my scheme would be muted by the general celebration having resolved myself the clouds of gloom lifted for me and i undertook to help with the feastday preparations which pleased and gratified my mother greatly yuletide found me in good spirits some of the vassals remarked that i had finally ceased pining for the loss of my dear wife accordingly i received the kindly attentions of certain daughters whose parents no doubt hoped for a noble match while i enjoyed their blandishments i did my best not to encourage their hopes my mind and heart were set on other things and i would not be dissuaded from my purpose still i did not lack for female companionship and passed a most pleasant yule i might wish now my darling gait that i had taken one of them to my heart for your sake to have provided you with a mother ere i departed would have been a blessing alas the notion occurred to me far too late i waited for my chance to reveal my plan finally on the last night of the festivities when the year had turned we gathered for the twelfth night celebration murdos hall was filled with vassals monks and friends from orkneyjar the vats were filled with spiced ale the cauldrons with stewed beef and pork with brown beans and steaming jars of mulled wine lined the long tables at the lords invitation we took our places at the board and began to eat and drink other dishes were brought and placed before us in their turn sausages cooked with ale and apples fish with fennel and smoked oxtongue roasted with sour cabbage on each table were small mountains of special round loavesthe twelfth night bread baked specially for the feast we ate and drank our fill of these delights and when the first pangs of hunger had receded abbot emlyn rose from his place and called the hall to silence my friends said the cleric lifting his voice above the cheerful rumble on such glad occasions it is good to pause and give thanks to the true lord of the feast who has so bounteously provided for his people with that he clasped his hands and bowed his head his prayer of thanks was simple and sincere and shorta quality which greatly endeared the abbot to his flock for when emlyn prayed one never got the feeling he was trying to chastise or rebuke his congregation by another means nor did he use the opportunity to display his erudition to impress or humble those beneath hima temptation far too many clerics do not resist when emlyn prayed he merely spoke his mind to his creator the gifting giver he so evidently loved when he finished my lord murdo rose next he instructed everyone to fill their cups and bowls and said we drink to the year now begun may the god of goodness and light bless us richly and may our realm prosper in every good and worthy thing we drank to that and he said if it shall please our great redeemer this time next year we will gather to consecrate the new church amen cried abbot emlyn so be it we raised our cups again and then i was on my feet every face turned towards me in anticipation before god and this brave company i said i pledge myself to undertake the pilgrimage to jerusalem for the sake of my soul if it should please god to reward my journey with success i will pray for our realm and ask the good lords blessing on us all this unexpected declaration was met with astonishment gasps and murmurs of surprise filled the hall emlyn stood quickly and came to my side he looked at me inquiringly are you so resolved he asked i am i replied he gathered me in a strong embrace saying god bless you my son it is the saviour king himself who has put this into your heart i thanked him and was suddenly swarmed by others who thronged me to wish me well and to add their pledges of support to my own several of the younger men offered to accompany me and others to send gifts of provisions or gold to aid the journey everyone it seemed was delighted with the purpose of my pilgrimage everyone that is except the one whose approval i valued the most murdo my lord stood looking at me as if he had taken an arrow through the heart then very slowly he walked to where i stood the hard expression on his face soured the mirth and all laughter ceased as an uneasy silence descended over the hall i could hear the fire crackling in the hearth as he stepped before me his eyes burning with rage that was ill spoken he breathed his voice softas if he struggled mightily to restrain it my mother distraught joined him my lord i said it has long been in my mind to do this thing i believe god has called me to his service we will speak of this later murdo said stiffly let us speak now i countered recklessly later murdo insisted this is not the time to pursue a family dispute i made to reply that this was as good a time as any when i felt my mothers hand on my arm trying to restrain me she implored me with a silent shake of her head as you will lord i replied yielding to ragnas gentle entreaty we will speak later the feast resumed but slowly and i felt like a rowdy cub that had just been slapped down by an annoyed bear i sat for a while trying to shrug off my reproof but it was no use the rebuke rankled and i could not easily stifle my resentment after awhile i found a chance to slink away and left the hall unnoticed i went out into the freezing night and felt the sting of the icy wind on my hot face what i asked myself had i expected did i really think murdo would clap his hands and extol my pilgrimage with high words and praises no what had happened was what i feared would happen nothing more the trouble was my own making if there was any consolation it was this at least i had announced my intention come what may my plan was no longer a secret all the next day i waited to be summoned to my lords chamber to receive the reprimand i knew was coming but it did not come the day passed and nothing was said we bade farewell to our guests and saw them away out of consideration for me no mention was made of my announcement of the previous night the day turned foul so i stayed in with little cait and took supper with my mother in the evening he is that angry with you duncan she said pursing her lips in her vexation he has snapped and snarled like a wolf with a toothache all day and refuses to come to the table she stopped ladling the soup into the bowl and looked at me you must go to him and tell him it was a mistake how so i asked he may not like it but it was no mistake i mean to go to jerusalem just as i said true i would go with a better heart if i had his blessing but with his approval or without it i will go she frowned duncan please you do not know what you are saying do i not my lady i said have i lived so long in this house that i know nothing of such things that is not what i meant she replied placing the bowl before me she sat down and folding her hands leaned towards me across the board when he returned from the pilgrimage she said your father vowed that neither he nor any of his family would ever again journey to the holy land you have gone against him in this and i fear the outcome i am sorry mother i replied but i knew nothing of this vow i wish you had said something son i could have told you she regarded me with sad eyes is it so important this pilgrimage my lady it is i replied earnestly it is all i have thought about since rhona died i believe god has put the desire in my heart and he alone can take it away and if you go it will kill your father ragna pointed out she frowned again and reached out to squeeze my hand believe me murdo could not stand the torment of your leaving the torment would be mine i said sharply not his lady ragna shook her head gently no she said because he knows even if you do notwhat lies before you he has been there duncan and he knows the dangers you will face he could not live with the hardship and suffering that would befall you if god has put it in my heart to go and i do not go i replied what am i to do then how am i to live with that eight i left banvard without speaking to my father again and the regret of that bitter leaving pains me still believe me cait i would give the world and all its treasures to have departed with a blessing from the one person in the world whose approval alone would have sustained me through the trials i have faced but murdo was implacable in his opposition he refused to speak to me until i repented of my plan this i could not do i have since had many occasions to wonder what he would have said if he had known the true purpose of my pilgrimage would it have made a difference who can say know this my soul and remember it always i have no fear of death for me to leave this life is to enter the next in triumph but the thought that i will die in this foreign land without ever seeing the faces of those i have loved best in life fills me with grief so strong it does take my breath away even so i bear my lot patiently for your sake and pray the caliph tarries yet awhile so that i may finish what i have begun it is a most curious captivity i declare i am given the best of food and drink my modest needs are met without the humiliation that so often accompanies captivity i even have a servant to attend me and in many ways i am treated as an honoured guest with all courtesy and respect even so i accept all i am given with gratitude knowing it could so easily be otherwise the muhammedans are a noble people never doubt it if peace were ever possible i think we should find ourselves brothers under the skin alas too much blood has been shed on both sides of the battle line for it to be forgiven there will never be peace between our peoples until our lord christ brings it at his return this i most heartily believe now i will tell how i came to marseilles on the morning i took the boat i asked sarn to accompany me i did not tell him where i was going i had made my farewells the night beforenot that anyone knew itand rose at dawn and went down to the bay to rouse sarn out of his nest of oars and sailcloth in warm weather he always slept in the hut beneath the cliff on the strand i let him think we were going fishing until we had made the headland and then i told him to sail for inbhir ness it was then he looked at the pack i had brought aboard where are you going lord he asked i am going away for a while i told him it is the pilgrimage so a sly expression passed over his open honest features giving him a look of mild imbecility of course everyone in the realm knew about my desire to undertake the pilgrimageand my fathers unyielding opposition to it the entire settlement had discussed it at length and most had taken sides have you made a wager on me he smiled readily yes lord he admitted without guile you are your fathers son some of the others said you would stay but i knew you would go once you have seen me to inbhir ness you can go back and collect your winnings i told him the wind is good we will be there before dusk he announced looking at the sky indicating my small bundle of belongings he said are you certain you have enough food to see you to jerusalem the abbot says it is very far away i have enough i allowed to see me three or four days after that i am in gods hands it is for him to provide do you have a sword he asked regarding my sad bundle doubtfully if i need a sword i will get one i told him true pilgrims carry no weapons he frowned at this but returned to his tiller and i to the contemplation of the task ahead of me it was my intention to follow my fathers example by going to inbhir ness and begging passage as a crewman for any ship sailing south i did not think it would be more than two or three days before i found a ship to take me on certainly when i bade farewell to sarn and sent him home i did not think to see him again but two days later i was still waiting at the quayside when he returned i saw the ship as it came into the harbour and recognized it my heart sank i imagined my lord had come to take me back but it was not murdo he had brought with him it was padraig if you have come to talk me out of leaving you can turn around and go home i told him bluntly my mind is made up i am on pilgrimage the tall softeyed monk regarded me mildly then i am a pilgrim too he replied what do you mean i asked suspiciously did my father send you to bring me home or not lord murdo says that if you leave now you leave forever you must never think to see your home again for the dead do not return he considers me a dead man is that it that is what he told me to say well you have said it you can go back and tell him that i must do what god has given me to do my uncle said that is what you would say padraig observed placidly abbot emlyn said that if you were determined to carry out your plan then i was to accompany you accompany me all the way to jerusalem yes lord affirmed the monk i am to be your servant and guide thank you padraig i told him but this is my decision you are free to go home tell the abbot i cannot accept responsibility for any life but my own i thank him for his kindness however sarn will tell him i am going with you he raised his hand and declared hear me pilgrimage is a sacred undertaking we go on faith or we do not go at all but if we travel with hope trusting in our great redeemer we need have no fear for we shall meet angels along the way who will befriend us look you as much as i would like your company i cannot allow you to go to jerusalem with me i said you have no provisions no cloak no water skin pointing to his bare feet i added you do not even have shoes padraig smiled my cloak and staff are in the boat if i have need of anything else god will supply it out of his matchless bounty sarn who had been listening to this exchange from his place at the bow rope spoke up that is the same thing you told me lord he chuckled you stay out of this i snapped i glared at them both daylight was quickly fading and twilight gathering if i sent them back now it would be dark before they reached the estuary very well i relented you can stay here with me tonight but you must leave in the morning padraig said nothing but set about making a fire sarn tied the boat to a post driven into the earthen bank that served as part of the harbour wall that finished he brought out a bundle and began unwrapping itloaves of bread dried fish and pork and other things to make a meal there is ale in the stoup he said lady ragna thought you might like a last good drink before going to the holy land stepping over the bow and into the ship i found the jar how did you know i would still be here the seaman shrugged there were no trading ships when i left you if any came they would not have departed so soon so now it is sarn the shrewd i suppose he smiled we would have drunk the ale whether you were here or not see you do not drink too much i warned lightly you are leaving in the morningboth of you together we ate our meal and night gathered around us torches were lit along the bank and we sat drinking ale and watching the flickering light along the quayside it was quiet there were few ships in the harbour and most of the sailors were at one or the other of the towns inns there are not many ships coming here i think sarn observed how long will you wait as long as it takes i replied slightly annoyed by the question i talked with a man yesterday who was at rouen in the spring he said the franks are raising men for the holy land rouen repeated padraig that is where lord ranulf and the northern noblemen joined the crusade it is i confirmed then maybe we should go there suggested the monk is that not the very thing i plan to do i retorted my irritation growing as soon as i can get a ship you already have a ship padraig pointed out sarn could take us i might have resented the idea if it had not struck me as faintly ridiculous he might i agreed haughtily if he had a chart and provisions enough for such a trip sarn brightened his smile wide in the dark i have these things i stared at him had the two of them conspired in this the boat is too small i complained truly i had imagined sailing into jerusalem aboard a norse longship like the one my father had journeyed in small yes sarn conceded amiably but the boat is sound and the weather good it could easily be done where did you get a chart i asked the monastery provided the chart padraig replied and explained how abbot emlyn had personally supervised the copying and preparation and you have provisions these we have also confirmed sarn enough for three men for several weeks of daysalthough the abbot does not think it will take so long we can depart in the morning padraig pointed out if you have no objection that is since you both seem to be determined i said then i will allow it you can accompany me to rouen and i shall be glad of the company once we reach the port however i continued raising a finger in warning you will turn around and sail home is that understood they both regarded me curiously is that understood i repeated it is a long way to frankland padraig mused perhaps it would be best to wait until we see what we find when we get there so we sailed for rouen leaving the next morning as soon as it was light enough to navigate the river estuary the winds were steady and the weather stayed fair we made good speed the first five or six days keeping the coast in sight by day and night sometimes we made camp on land most often we slept in the boat we lost sight of land only once when fog stole the coast for a night and part of the next day it was only upon crossing the narrows and coming in sight of the prankish coast that the weather soured and we were lashed by the tail of a thunderous storm the wind shrieked and hurled stinging waves over the rails time and again padraig clung to the mast and prayed sarn and i bailed with cup and water stoup we stood off the coast until the storm had passed then almost shaking with relief and singing psalms of thanksgiving proceeded south to the sea mouth of the river the franks call seine the city of rouen lies a fair way up river and as there was considerable movement to and fro on along the coast we had no difficulty finding the right channel to take us inland indeed we followed a large flemish trading vessel and arrived two days later while sarn tended the boat padraig and i talked to the masters and pilots of other vessels to learn who might be heading south padraigs latin was good and i was pleased to find that mine sharpened quickly as i regained the rhythms of the speech id been taught since boyhood it seemed that i had arrived at the right place for the wharf was very busy as it happened i was offered passage on no fewer than three ships in exchange for work after discussing the matter with padraig i decided to accept a place aboard a danish ship sailing for genoaone of the places marked on sams map indeed we were walking along the wharf to inform the ships master of my decision when two men appeared on the quay their arrival caused such a commotion of excitement that padraig and i turned aside to see what they were about tall and lean they walked with the confident authority of kings their darkbearded faces haughty and lordly as they scanned the waterfront before them the long swords at their belts were freshly burnished and gleamed their high boots were new they wore simple tunicsone brown the other white the one in white i noticed also had a broad cross of red cloth sewn upon his chest a group of sailors sitting on the wharf stood abruptly i heard one of them murmur a name i turned to the man and asked what he had said he pointed to the red cross on the mans tunic and said templars turning to padraig i repeated the word and added have you ever heard the name he confessed his ignorance and suggested we join the crowd which was quickly gathering around the two men and see what they had to say friends shouted the man in the white tunic come closer he motioned the people nearer and when the throng had formed around him he proclaimed in the name of our blessed saviour i greet you and beg your kind indulgence my name is renaud de bracineaux and you can see by the cross on my surcoat that i am a knight of the order of the poor fellowsoldiers of christ and the temple of solomon a flutter of excitement coursed through the crowd whatever this order of poor fellowsoldiers might be it aroused great interest and enthusiasm among the people more of whom were running to join the throng i will not detain you from your errands the knight continued i merely wish it to be known that our illustrious grand master hugh de payens has lately arrived from jerusalem for the purpose of inducing men of noble lineage to join our order which is dedicated to the aid of christian pilgrims in the holy land and the protection of the true cross these last words caused my ears to burn i determined to speak to this knight in private and was even then calculating how this might be accomplished when he said i thank you for your courtesy my sergeant and i will remain in rouen until dawn tomorrow if anyone should wish to speak with us further the knight dismissed the crowd with a blessing and the knot of people slowly dispersed several young men wanted to hear more and followed the two knights as they walked from the quayside padraig and i fell in behind and soon found ourselves before a low wooden house fronted by a wickerwork stall from which a man was selling bread and ale and roast fowl the sawn stumps of trees topped with planks formed benches on which his patrons might sit to enjoy their meals friends said renaud it would be a very blessing if you would consent to join gislebert and myself in our midday repast of course we all agreed right readily whereupon the templar called tothe keeper of the inn to supply us liberally with an assortment of his wares the merchant and his wife busied themselves at once producing bowls of frothy brown ale baskets of bread and platters of roast fowl padraig and i found places on one of the benches the young men talked excitedly and asked many questions which the knight answered patiently explaining what would be required to enter their orderas well as the rich rewards awaiting all who donned the white surcoat we drank and ate our fill and listened carefully to all that was said i quickly discovered that this order of the knights of the temple was in fact a monastic order made up of noblemen sworn to christs service for an agreed period during which they were required to forsake family and possessions and swear a vow of poverty chastity and unswerving loyalty to their brother knights in exchange for their vow the newlyaccepted brothers would receive a horse a fine hauberk of ringed mail a sword shield battle helm and a fine white surcoat with the distinctive red cross hear padraig i whispered they are monks monks with swords this is wonderful he nodded gazing on the knights in amazement indeed who had ever heard of such a thing when the young men departed pledging themselves to return later with the permission of their families to undertake initiation into the order the templar turned to me what say you my friend he asked amiably is there any way i can be of service to you i thank you most heartily for your generosity i replied in my best latin as i myself am a pilgrim even now bound for the holy land much of what you have said interests me greatly this is most fortuitous is it not gislebert he cried to his companion my friend he said to me i ween by your speech that you are a nobleman rest assured that should you undertake holy orders you would be admitted to the highest rank of our brotherhood our lord christ requires the services of such men to protect his people in the holy land from the savage predations of the infidel i granted that attractive as the opportunity to join the poor fellowsoldiers of christ undoubtedly was i had undertaken a separate vow which i could not lightly put off i understand renaud replied sympathetically still i would be remiss in my sworn duty if i did not point out that a rare opportunity exists which may be of value to you what is that our illustrious grand master has sought and received the commendation of pope honorius ii to grant full ordination of limited duration to any brother who wishes it how long would be required i asked intrigued by the notion whatever god in his wisdom has laid on your heart my friend answered renaud speaking strictly for myself i would think two years to be a sufficient duration to aid the brotherhoodalthough i have known many men to pledge five years or seven a few have promised service for only a year as the spirit leads i see i mention this because he said smiling his teeth a white flash of lightning against the dark cloud of his beard you seem a most thoughtful and capable man and one who takes his vows in solemn earnest also since you travel in the company of a monk i am persuaded that you understand the sanctity of our duty better than most tell me have i misjudged you in no way my lord i replied then permit me to suggest that you need not put off your vow at all merely suspend it for a season i stood and said be assured i will consider your offer carefully i thanked him for his generosity and wished him farewell rising the templar nodded to his sergeant gislebert who went to settle with the proprietor for the ale and food while he walked a little way with me tomorrow we must continue on our way he said and went on to explain that his brother knights were likewise searching the towns and cities for men to undertake service in the holy land we will come together in marseilles at summers end he said and sail from there to otranto where we will join bohemond and travel to the holy land while he was speaking a quarrel flared up between the owner of the stall and the templar sergeant as my attention was given wholly to renaud i did not hear how the altercation began but suddenly the owner of the stall was shouting but this is not enough sir you asked for the best and i gave you the best out of the corner of my eye i saw the innkeeper holding out his hands in dismay at the few small coins he had been given it is more than enough gislebert told him flatly be quiet it is all you get he made to turn away but the innkeeper put out a hand to stop him the templar reacted as if he had been struck a blow from a sword he spun around hand upraised ready to strike be quiet you he hissed do you want the whole city to know you are a thief is there some trouble sergeant called renaud taking an interest at last i asked for ten deniers cried the aggrieved merchant it is a fair sumask anyone it is an honest sum he thrust out his hand to show the small coins he gives me but seven seven only that is not fair the templar raised his hand to silence the man give him what he asks gislebert he said adding let us be more careful where we trade next time it is a fair price the proprietor insisted accepting the additional coins from the grudging sergeants hand ask anyone in the city they will tell you he appealed to no one the templar had already turned back to me and was saying we must be on our way my friend but remember if you should change your mind you will be most welcome to join us only he added you must decide very soon it is a long way to marseilles again i promised to think about all he had said thanked him for the food and drink and bade him farewell pax vobiscum called the knight raising his hand in benediction after us god go with you pax vobiscum replied padraig we walked on in silence retracing our steps to the quayside where we joined the traders and porters passing to and fro along the wharf with their baskets kegs bundles and chests of goods unable to rein in his curiosity any longer padraig said are you truly thinking of joining them it is tempting i confessed but no my thoughts are otherwise then what are you thinking my lord i am thinking i replied that if a pilgrim were bound for the holy land he could not do better than to travel in the company of gods own knights nine we spent the rest of the day and most of the next trying to discover more about this marseilles for although padraig professed to know of the place he had no idea how far it might be nor by which route it could be found we showed sarns map to the pilots of no fewer than six of the larger ships and asked them if they could show us where it might be two of them had never heard of the place one knew the name and told us it was on the south coast but had never been there and three pilots tried to buy sarns chart for themselves then as the sun was going down a slender young man approached the place where our boat was tied sarn and i were sitting on the wharf discussing the problem and padraig was stirring among the supplies in preparation of our evening meal the stranger came to where we stood and bowed low before us pax vobiscum he said i would be most grateful if you could tell me if i am speaking to the men who have been inquiring about marseilles his speech although flawless lacked warmthas if he were uttering words he was being forced against his will to speak i regarded him closely his eyes were large and dark against his sallow skin his hair was black and thick and cut close so that the curls were tight to his scalp like a knitted cap his limbs were thin the clothing that hung on his bony frame however was of the finest cut and cloth and well made on his thumb was a huge ring of gold and a fat purse hung at the wide belt which gathered his long tunic around his toonarrow waist a large knife with a bone handle protruded from the folds we have been asking about marseilles i replied and explained that it was our wish to join the templar fleet travelling to the holy land his large dark eyes which had appeared somewhat cloudy or hazy suddenly brightened at my affirmation this is your boat he said pointing to the sturdy craft behind us it is yes i replied and you are its master yes he asked almost quivering with excitement the boat belongs to my father i told him but i have the use of it splendid he cried and i thought he would swoon when he had calmed himself he said please do not think me brazen but i would like to hire your boat i admire your boldness i told him but i must disappoint you my boat is not for hire you see we i have money he said quickly i will pay whatever you ask it is very important that i return to my home in anazarbus as soon as possible again i fear i must disappoint you i replied and explained that so far as we could understand it was a very long voyage to our destination and that we possessed as anyone could see only a small vessel with four passengers it would not only be uncomfortable but dangerous as well i am very sorry i told him still this is a busy port no doubt you will soon find someone else who can take you he frowned as sorrow overtook him and i thought he would cry his head dropped forwards and he looked at his feet then he drew a deep steadying breath and said i have no wish to appear impertinent but the extremity of my plight makes me persist where others would graciously relent if i offend you i beg your forgiveness it seems to me however that you contemplate sailing to marseilles by sea sarn smiled his latin was good enough to understand most of what the young man was saying sailing is best done at sea he replied dryly of course allowed the stranger a man of your obvious skill would find it so i merely wish to point out a fact that might have escaped your notice you see there is another way you know this other way i asked indeed yes and you would show us of course yes if i were a passenger in your boat he said it would be in my best interest to reach our destination by the fastest way possible he smiled his face suddenly glowing with triumph what do you say my friend i will most happily be your guide now it was sarns turn to frown he leaned near putting his head close to mine i do not like this fellow he said how can we be certain he knows what he is talking about we will find out more i told him to the thin young man i said what you say intrigues me i do confess perhaps you would care to have supper with us and we will sit together and discuss the matter glancing at padraig who was beginning to assemble the various items for our meal the young man said you are most gracious lord i will sup with you but i must beg you to allow me to contribute something to the meal despite my assurances that this was not in any way necessary he hastened awayonly to reappear a short while later accompanied by a man carrying a large bundle in one hand and two goodsized jars in the other at the young mans direction the man placed the jars and bundle on the ground and with a low nod of his head hurried away please said the young stranger indicating that we should open the bundle sarn obliged pulling the knot in the cloth which opened to reveal a veritable feast there were spitroasted fowl and fish of several kinds freshbaked bread dried fruit and sweetmeats there was a stew of beans and pork in a sauce of savoury herbs and little cakes made with honey and almonds and covered in tiny white seeds there was enough for all of us and more besides pointing to the two jars he said i did not know if you preferred ale or wineso i brought both sarn was delighted with the banquet and grinned happily perhaps we might listen to what he has to say he whispered and began laying out the food i called padraig to come join us and bade the young man to sit down i am duncan murdosson of banvard in caithness i said and this is sarn shortfinger my pilot and padraig ap carradoc my friend and advisor the young man professed himself delighted to make our acquaintance and bowing low declared i am lord roupen son of prince leo of armenia he sat down on the wharf removing his shoes and crossing his legs padraig blessed the meal then handed the bowls and cups around and we began to eat the food was excellent and we were soon licking our fingers and smacking our lips our young friend however picked at his food as if he found it distasteful or unpalatable he smiled wanly from tune to time as sarn unable to help himself exclaimed over the various dishes your generosity has won the favour of our pilot it would seem i observed pouring wine into the young lords cup but i cannot help noticing that you do not share his enthusiasm for our meal alas it is so he sighed exquisite as it surely is i cannot eat this fare sarn heard this and asked is it because you are a jew roupen smiled sadly i am neither a jew nor a muhammedandespite what many believe the princes of armenia have been christians for a thousand years he glanced with pensive sadness at the food alas my lack of appetite is due to a unknown malady with which i have been inflicted since coming to this country i am sorry to hear it you are most kind still i have been far more fortunate than my bodyguard and advisorthey took ill and died of it he went on to tell how he had come to paris as part of a royal delegation hoping to establish formal relations with the prankish king there were fifteen men and women altogether and all had succumbed to the mysterious illness dying within a few days of one another i too was taken seriously ill and was many weeks under the shadow of death by gods decree i alone have survived that is unfortunate i replied pouring wine into his cup i can well understand your desire to return home as swiftly as possible i handed him the cup which he accepted bowing his head in gratitude we drank together for a moment and i asked this other way i said would i be wrong in thinking it was by river he nodded raising two fingers there are two rivers with but a short distance between them larger ships would find them too narrow and shallow to navigate but your boat will have no difficulty whatever sarn put his head near mine and whispered to me my pilot wishes to know if you have navigated these rivers yourself do you doubt me sir replied the young man suddenly irate the route i propose was the same as that by which my companions and myself arrived in frankland by all means assure your expert pilot that aside from a short distance which must be covered by wagon it is possible to do what i suggest otherwise i would not have mentioned it do not misunderstand i replied it is not your honesty that concerns him it is your memory i explained quickly about sarns map which the pilot hoped to enlarge by adding the details of our journey the young lord smiled thinly again i must ask your forgiveness my many travails in this land have made me unduly suspicious and quick to judge i beg your indulgence it will not happen again we drank some more and he seemed to relax a little i had already decided that his knowledge of the river route would be invaluable to us but i did not wish to tell him so without the ready consent of my fellow passengers so after the meal i asked him to allow us a moment to discuss the matter we spoke our northern tongue so that he would not overhear what we said i think we would be well advised to take this fellow on i began a journey by river has much to recommend it over a voyage by sea i say we take him at his word and let him guide us to our destination padraig added his approval he is a fellow christian and comes seeking our aid he is obviously unwell to turn him away would be an offence against heaven and one we might regret it is true our craft is small sarn said but if he helps me with the map i will be happy to share deck space with him he nodded considering his decision then added he must control his tongue though if he can do that we will get on well enough then we are agreed i concluded i will tell him roupen came close to tears on learning of his good fortune he took my hands in both of his and pledged his perpetual gratitude and fealty now then he said recovering himself somewhat we must establish the price of my passage we have agreed to take you in exchange for showing us the way padraig told him nothing more is necessary but he would not hear of it the service you do me is invaluable i will pay for my passage and gladly nor will my father be slow in rewarding you richly for your inestimable assistance taking the pouch from his belt he untied it and began shaking gold coins onto his palm he counted out twenty golden bezants sorted them into two equal stacks and passed one of them to me this for my passage to marseilles he said tipping the gold into my hand and you will receive as much again when we arrive safely raising the second stack he held it before me this is for the necessary provisions for the journey i am the son of a prince and accustomed to the best of food and drink wherever i go therefore i expect the boat to be supplied accordingly i accepted the gold gladly and without disagreementwhich i could see surprised padraig somewhat truly it was not a matter of courtesy or generosity i had come away from banvard without so much as the price of a small fish in my purse i had professed my faith in god to provide for us and the appearance of young lord roupen seemed to be the gifting givers way of answering our need i was in no wise minded to shun the open hand of the almighty upon agreeing to the bargain i said we will depart tomorrow as soon as we have gathered supplies for the journey come to us as soon as you are ready we will await you here he smiled with slight embarrassment if it would not trouble you too much he said i would find it agreeable to spend the night aboard the boat then you will have no need to wait for me later sarn pointed out that it was not so much a matter of waiting but of trusting this fellow is afraid we will leave without him the pilot said after all now that we have his gold we do not need him our friend is right to be wary i told him of the four of us he has the most to lose i think we can tolerate his distrust until he knows us better i think you should tell him we are not thieves or cutthroats sarn insisted otherwise he will wear us out with his watching day and night you tell him i said he will thank you for your concern seeing that i meant it the pilot approached the young man and in halting latin established the fact that we were christian pilgrims and not vicious thieves bent on slitting his belly and dumping his corpse in the river at first opportunity what roupen made of this assurance i cannot say but sarn certainly seemed pleased to have sworn the innocence of his intentions we gave our noble passenger the bottom of the boat for his bed sarn slept on the tiller bench and padraig and i slept on the wharf as soon as the port began to stir the next morning we bought the few things we needed and with a prayer to speed us on our way set off up river ten sailing on a river is more tedious than navigation by sea it is not without certain benefits however if the wind fails you can always get out and walk along the bank and if necessarywhen confronted by strong currents or a contrary windyou can tow the boat also since a river runs only where it will there is less chance of losing your way the franks called the river seine and it was to be our constant companion for a good many days roupen said that the next town we should come to would be paris which we would reach in five days in fact we reached it in four days we paused only long enough to gather a few more provisions and then set off again straightaway for the merchants of paris were a haughty imperious tribe and overenvious of the gold in our purses as we began to adjust to this new way of voyaging i found the days most pleasant sometimes we walked and sometimes we sailed occasionally we towed the boat with ropes tied to the bow even going with the current it was hard work but there were three of us to spell one another so no one had to bear the brunt of the labour too long still at the end of a days towing we were heartily glad we had only a fishing boat and not a fully laden longship the weather remained warm for the most part and exceedingly dry as we slipped further and further into the heart of frankish land we passed through many settlements along the way some large with fine stone churches most smalla scattering of huts on a muddy track beside the river tiny fields and a cattle enclosure or two we bought supplies and provisions as required often we bargained with the farmers themselves or more likely their wives who were more canny in their dealings in this way we got fresh eggs milk and bread meat and cheese and as summer passed fruit apples plums of all kinds pears and berries on this honest fare the sallow young lord began to regain his former health his colour improved and his strength increased he still tired more easily than the rest of us but undertook such chores as he was able with never a breath of complaint as roupens stomach could not take heavier meat we fed him with fish from the river sarn grew very adept at catching fine brown trout which we enjoyed almost as much as the mackerel we got at home roupen appeared fascinated by sarns ability to tease the fish out of the dark water he watched with such fierce concentration whenever sarn threw out the line that the seaman undertook to teach him by way of exchange the young man offered to help sarn with his latin the two of them became good friends sarn is of a cautious disposition he gives away little of himself unless he is satisfied his gift will not be squandered or belittled he saw in roupen someone who would honour his friendship and the young lord found a steadfast companion who did not demand anything of him save simple kindliness consequently under sarns affable instruction roupen began to lose some of the stiff wariness in his demeanour one day he startled us all by laughing out loud at something sarn was attempting to say he threw back his head clutched his sides and shook with mirth while we looked on in amazement as the veil of melancholy with which he habitually cloaked himself was suddenly ripped away revealing a young man who i suspect had not known a moments solitary delight in years his outburst intrigued me but i did not like to embarrass him so i waited until the next day to ask him about it sarn and padraig were towing the boat i was minding the tiller and roupen was braiding a bit of rope sarn had given him for practice what is it like for you at home he thought for a long moment and then said it is like living in a churcha very great church full of priests and penitents and pilgrims in my fathers palace worship never ceases indeed prayers ascend on clouds of incense day and night and the bells ring continually from my father the prince to the least stableboy everyone says his prayers six times a day some would consider that a very paradise i remarked perhaps it would be he allowed if the whole world did not seek our destruction every hand is against us and we are continually on guard lest our enemies crush us and scatter our ashes to the four winds when i asked how his people had managed to make so many enemies he explained that it was ever thus the latin church does not recognize our faith he said mournfully they think us worse than infidels and byzantium will not rest until they have brought us under the rule of the emperor also since we are first and foremost christians the muhammedans harass and abuse us at every turn it was for that reason my father sent the delegation to the king of the franks it was our hope that we might form an alliance with one or more rulers in the west who could use their authority to prevent the crusaders from attacking us in return we would offer to help them maintain the pilgrim roads and keep their pilgrims safe from thieves and turks did the king listen roupen shook his head sadly the chance never came we made proper representations to his advisors and courtiers who accepted our gifts and promised to bring our concerns before the king but the day of audience was always delayed for one reason or another when the king finally deigned to see us the sickness had done its work and there was no one leftexcept me and i was too ill to keep my head upright let alone hold lengthy converse with the king he sighed and his shoulders slumped by the time i was well enough to speak to him the king had long since gone away with his courtiers to his hunting estates in the north at least you are alive to try again i pointed out no doubt that is why god has spared youso you can help your people perhaps he conceded reluctantly although i have never understood why god does anything if the lord of hosts wanted me to help my people he might simply have allowed me to speak with the king as we had planned he paused thoughtfully adding and saved the lives of fourteen people into the bargain the ways of heaven are mystery itself agreed padraig i glanced up to see that the boat was drifting near the bank padraig was listening and offered this observation in all sympathy i will pray that the great king makes his purpose known to you in a way you will understand we changed places with sarn and padraig slipping our arms into the loops of the tow ropes and with a long steady pull to get the boat moving started off again the day was fair and the sun hot and i soon found myself dreaming about what might be happening at home in scotland i thought about you dearest gait and wondered what you were doing at that very moment i imagined you picking berries with ragna or chasing the geese with a willow switch i thought about abbot emlyn and it gave me some comfort to know that whatever befell us on this journey he would be praying for us this put me in mind of the true purpose of my pilgrimagea thing which i had not shared with a single living soul not even padraig i knew i would have to tell him one day soon but thought it would not hurt to wait a little longer as it happened that day was a sabbath so when we camped for the night padraig performed a worship service for us i sat on the riverbank listening to his clear strong voice singing the ancient words in gaelic while onebyone the timid stars kindled and took light i sat there thinking i had never heard anything so beautiful and wished rhona was with me to share it although the days seemed to pass in lazy almost effortless succession we were all the time growing closer to the most difficult portion of our journey the portage over the hills leading to the saone valley upon our arrival at the settlement which marked the end of the navigable stream we found men who earned their living by hauling boats and passengers and goods from one valley to the other for a fee they were prepared to guarantee safe passage overland to the next river as roupen had dealt with these men before he undertook to make the arrangements sarn was not content to entrust his boat to roughhanded strangers so he accompanied the young lord to help him choose an acceptable carrier for our vessel they returned a short while later well satisfied with the arrangements they had made the haulier will come with his wagon and oxen tomorrow morning sarn informed us we must have all our goods and belongings stacked on the shore so he can draw the boat out of the water he pointed to a place a little way upstream where long pine poles had been laid down sidebyside on a shallow slope of the bank that is where we must wait next morning we were ready by midday we were still waiting meanwhile two more boats had arrived and both had been hauled out of the water and carried away and still there was no sign of our haulier twice i sent sarn to look for the fellow to no avail when he finally arrived the day was hastening from us here i am he called it is dodu at your service we were told you would come this morning i snapped we have been standing here all day dodu apologized and explained that on setting out that morning he noticed one of the axles on his wagon had split and the repair had taken longer than he hoped he would have sent his boy along to tell us he said but the child had injured his foot and stayed at home the haulier spoke plainly his latin the uncomplicated speech of a child he smiled and spread his hands starting off with a broken axle would never do he said such things only get worse never better i agreed with him and he set about his work humming cheerfully to himself and calling endearments to his docile pair of brownandwhite spotted oxen the wagon was little more than two sets of wheels on heavy axles joined by a strong iron chain which could be adjusted according to the size of the boat to be carried once he had pulled the boat from the water we raised the bow of the craft by way of long poles and attached the front wheels with ropes the oxen straining at their wooden yokes pulled the craft higher up the bank and we levered up the stern and attached the rear wheels we then replaced all the goods and rigging back in the boat and lashed the mast to the bow and stern by the time we finished the sun was well down and we were growing hungry nevertheless i was anxious to get at least a little further along the trail before stopping for the night so we made a start as it had been dry for many days the road the boatmen used was high and wellkept we moved out from the trees which grew along the river and started up a long rising slope towards the crest of the first hill the heat of the day was swiftly fading and the calls of homewinging birds filled the air the oxen moved slowly sturdy legs stumping their heavy hooves raising little puffs of dust with every step the haulier goad in hand walked beside them coaxing them along with whistles and little clucking noises he was a simple humble soulone of those who not blessed with an overabundance of wit nevertheless make up the lack with a pleasant kindly disposition dodu was so goodnatured i forgave him his lateness and shortly felt the peace of the evening settle over me we walked a while and reached the top of the first hill i looked back down into the valley the way we had come the river was hidden by the trees which formed a dark ruffled line stretching away into the gathering twilight the soft night air smelled of dry grass and sage the scent of wood smoke drifted up from the valley a stone wall separated the road from a small field twilight was deepening around us so we decided to halt there for the night sarn made a fire and padraig busied himself cooking a porridge of dried peas and barley which we ate with hard black bread after the meal padraig sang a song and dodu told us a story about a man from his village who found an image of the holy virgin in the moss on the side of his cattle byre everyone came to see this wonder including the lord and the local priest who declared it a miracle and commanded that the image be accorded all respect the mans wife had gone blind the previous winter he explained and when the woman was brought before the cow byre her eyes began to sting tears fell in a very flood the haulier told us she cried out and wiped her eyes with the hem of her mantle and when she raised her head her eyesight was restored roupen listened idly stirring the fire with a stick was anyone else healed by this miraculous image he asked his face illumined by the glowing embers alas no replied dodu word spread far and wide of course and the sick and lame began to come in their numbers what happened wondered sarn it rained and the image washed away from that day to this he concluded it has never been seen again sarn nodded sagely and padraig smiled to himself but roupen made a noise through his nose as if a bug had crawled into his nostril the haulier turned his head to regard the young lord indignantly what do you doubt what i say is true i can show you the cow byre and i can show you the woman i am certain you can roupen said still stirring the embers i do not doubt you in the least it merely seemed queer to me that god should trouble himself so with moss and mysterious images if he wished the womans sight restored why did he not simply heal her better still whyif he wanted to help the poor womandid he allow her to go blind in the first place who are you demanded dodu angrily that you know the ways of the lord god almighty i am no one replied roupen his voice sinking in dejection please do not upset yourself over anything i have said it is merely the buzzing of a gnat in your ear nothing more with that he snapped the stick in half and tossed it into the fire he drew up his knees to his chin and sat staring into the fire but said nothing more the rest of the night talk dwindled after that and we fell asleep where we laywaking at dawn to continue on we made slow but steady progress throughout the next day and had the road to ourselves passing no one in either direction we camped for the night beside the road as before only to be awakened just before dawn by the sound of horses coming up the hill i heard the faint clop of the hooves and awoke at once padraig rose and stood beside me how many he asked peering into the darkness can you see them no i told him two or three at least maybe more the moon had set and although i could hear the riders coming nearer with every step i could not see them wake the others i told him there may be trouble the monk had just turned to his task when a voice called out ho what have we here the horses stopped a few muted words were exchanged and one of the riders came on alone he emerged out of the nighta big coarselooking fellow with a frayed cloak over his broad shoulders he sat for a moment looking down at us i could see him taking the measure of our group hail and welcome i said stepping boldly forwards you are early to the trail the man leaned forwards patting the neck of his horse it is a sin to waste the day abed he replied grinning easily this way we also avoid the jostling crowds since you are in a hurry i replied please do not allow us to delay you there is the road and you are welcome to it still smiling he looked across to the boat and the oxen which were tethered nearby that is a heavy chore he observed hauling boats over hills perhaps we can do you a service we have no money i told him bluntly we could not pay you did i say anything about payment the man asked as if aggrieved by my suggestion i am certain we can come to an agreeable arrangement he made a motion with his hands and his comrades came forwards i heard the cold ring of steel as swords were drawn from hangers and three more riders appeared short swords in their fists padraig having roused the others came to stand beside me in the name of christ he said softly leave us in peace the foremost riders smile turned nasty as he drew his sword from beneath his cloak we mean to lighten your load friends nothing more give us no trouble and youll get none get up all of you stand over there he directed us a few paces away padraig and i obeyed at once the haulier groggy with sleep and rubbing his eyes stumbled forwards complaining sarn glowering and muttering in norse came next roupen wary but silent followed as he stepped from the road to take his place beside me i saw his hand twitch at his stomach and his belt slid free he dropped it to the ground behind him while the leader of the thieves kept watch over us his men began tossing everything out of the boat they worked with such deftness and quick purpose could see they were well accustomed to their labour they made a heap of everything they found bundled it up and tied the bundles behind their saddles while we stood watching powerless to prevent them then when they turned their attention to the oxen dodu started forwards no no he cried take everything else take our food take our goods but leave my beasts shut up you warned the thief get back but the haulier paid him no heed he rushed forwards making for the place where the oxen were being untied the chief bandit wheeled his horse his arm flashed out and i heard a dull crunching thud dodu moaned and fell sprawling in the dust padraig started to his aid swinging around to face us once more the thief said you there stand still or youll get the same i pulled padraig back just get on with it i growled take it and leave having secured the oxen one of the thieves began leading them away the others returned to their horses and climbed into their saddles you see we are happy to oblige pointing with the tip of his sword he indicated roupens purse on the ground now then if you will kindly hand me that belt and purse we will be on our way roupen made no move but glared stubbornly ahead his mouth clamped shut in defiance so the bandit chief called to one of his men who retrieved the belt and then searched the young lord roughly from head to foot finding nothing else he passed the belt and purse to his master who snatched it up the rogue wheeled his mount and started away kill them he called over his shoulder the thug swung towards us brandishing his sword i could see him trying to work out which of us to murder first as roupen was the nearest and the weakest he decided to begin the slaughter with him i waited until he turned towards the young man and then simply stretched out my foot and tripped him as he passed the brute sprawled forwards on his hands and knees but failed to release his grip on the sword the blade struck the dirt and bent near the hilt stepping quickly forwards i stomped down hard on his forearm just above the wrist and heard a crisp snap the brigand yelped in surprise and pain as i bent down and snatched the weapon from his unresisting fingers get up i told him he sat up slowly scowling at me and rubbing his injured arm sarn ran to the boat and looked inside they have taken everything he called even the water skins meanwhile padraig hurried to the hauliers aid rolled him over and put his face near dodus nose and mouth he is alive the monk announced then feeling carefully around the injured mans head and neck he added there is no blood i think he will live but we must try to wake him i joined padraig to help with this task and gave sarn and roupen the chore of tying up the thief truss him tight i told them i want him secure for the next magistrate we meet with padraig on one side and myself on the other we gently raised the inert bulk of the unlucky haulier into a sitting position we were just steadying him when i heard sarn shout i looked up to see him rolling on his backside his legs kicking in the air as the thug made for his horse with three great bounds he gained the saddle lashed his mount to speed and raced after his nowdistant comrades leaving us to ourselves once more there was nothing to be done in the dark so as padraig tended the gooseegg on dodus head i built up the fire again and then we all settled down to wait for the dawn daylight confirmed that sarn was right the bandits had indeed robbed us of everythingexcept the boat and that could not be moved without a team of oxen how far is the next settlement i asked the haulier far enough he replied sorrowfully those oxen are my living without them i am destitute ruined he grabbed his head and moaned i am ruined how far i asked again tell me dodu he thought for a moment if this is the first hill he began it is i confirmed we passed no others this was the first then there are three more hills before the next settlementa half days walk he sighed closing his eyes half a day ahead and two behind i said i guess we go on but we will get no help there it is two farms and a pigsty only they have nothingnot even a dog after that i said how far to the next there are no others dodu sighed until you come to the sane there is a mill and the miller keeps oxen to turn the wheel how far is the mill four days he moaned and miller babeau is a very disagreeable man leaving the haulier to his misery i rose and went to the boat i leaned my weight against the stern and gave it a push the wagon wheels creaked as it rocked forwards slightly what are you thinking asked padraig we cannot pull the boat all the way to the river we cannot leave it here objected sarn quickly if you do you leave me behind as well i will not abandon my boat peace i told him i am not for abandoning the boat if we can haul it to the next settlement you and roupen can stay there and guard it while we walk to the mill padraig gazed down the slope before us and up the long rising incline to the next crest in the distance it grows no shorter for staring at it i told him then we had best get started eleven using the ropes with which we had towed the boat on the river i attached them to the stern two men on each rope i said handing one of the ends to padraig we will lower the boat down the hill a step at a time and the fifth man wondered sarn he will stand ready to place a beam under the wheels to stop the wagon if it begins to roll too fast where will we get this beam asked dodu i looked at the mast but it was too long and unwieldy for one person alone also i did not wish to risk damaging it beneath the wheels of the wagon we will use stones until we can find a tree branch large enough thus with padraig and sarn on one rope dodu and me on the other and roupen carrying two large stones borrowed from the wall beside the road we began at first it appeared we would have an easy time of it once we got the wagon onto the road the slope fell away so gradually that we had only to keep the rope taut to prevent the boat from rolling too fast halfway down the hill the haulier said this is not so bad now i know how my team feels in yoke wait until we start up the other side before you decide whether you wish to change places with your oxen padraig remarked we reached the bottom of the hill and stopped to rest the sun was moving higher and the day growing warmer a few wispy clouds trailed across the sky but they would provide no shade the air was still so there would be no cooling breeze i saw a long hot exhausting day stretching out before usand with no food or water at the end of it to refresh and strengthen us the incline of the next hill proved not so steep as it first appeared roupen who had but light work on the way down more than doubled his labour he was continually darting from one side of the wagon to the other to place the stones behind the wheels to prevent the boat from rolling backward after each hard pull of the rope had gained us a few precious paces by dint of hard work we reached the top of the hill by midday and stopped for another rest we looked both ways along the road but saw no other travellers nor any signs of habitation anywhere nearby padraig found a small spring in a rocky cleft low down at the side of the hill we all went down to drink our fill and then climbed the hill once more to sit in the shade of the boat we dozed through the heat of the day and then rose once more to our work taking up the ropes with stiff hands again the downward slope was gentle and we made short work of it reaching the bottom of the hill in less than half the time the ascent required the next hill appeared but little steeper than the one we had passed that morning so i was confident we could reach the top by nightfall we will camp for the night up there i said exhorting my exhausted little band there are some trees for shelter i think we best move along if we are to finish before dark this brought groans of displeasure as we resumed our places once more we were well tired now the days labour had worn away our strength each step was a struggle for but small advance in the end my hope of reaching the hilltop by nightfall proved wildly optimistic the moon rose while we were yet but halfway to the top and the stars were alight in the clear blue heavens long before we put the stones behind the wheels for the last time and fell sprawling into the long grass beneath the trees too tired to talk we slept where we dropped the next day was much like the one beforesave that we were stiff and aching from our rough sleep and the previous days exertions and the hill rising before us was steeper than either of the two we had conquered the settlement is in the valley beyond dodu said once we gained the top there is a wide meadow and a stream we will get water and something to eat then why are we waiting demanded sarn the sooner we reach the settlement the sooner we can get something in our stomachs the first part of the ascent went well but when the incline grew suddenly steeper and we could no longer move the boat by pulling on the ropes we were forced to push the day passed in a haze of sweat and blistering sunlight the muscles in my shoulders back and legs knotted my throat grew dry and my tongue seemed to swell in my mouth my feet tangled time and again so that i had to struggle to stay upright each slow agonizing step became a battle of will and determination as we fought our way to the top where we collapsed in the middle of the road to lay gasping and staring up at the sky the sweat running from our bodies in rivulets after a time i sat up and looked down into the valley as dodu had said the settlement was little more than two clusters of buildings huddled together beside the road with fields on either side there was a small stone enclosure for pigs a few hayracks a raised storehouse and a stand of trees beyond the fields it may not have been much but god be praised it was not far and the slope was not steep the end is in sight i told them the hard work is over we have but to ease the wagon down the hill and rest is oursfood and drink as well we will eat and drink tonight i said and sleep on straw come our supper awaits i wonder if they have any beer said sarn i will gladly settle for bread and water remarked padraig listen to you now said the haulier still puffing as he climbed laboriously to his feet down there lives the woman who makes the best ale from the seine to the saoneand smoked pork chops too i always buy a few whenever i pass why have you kept this from us till now demanded sarn you should be telling us this from the first i did not want to cause you an injury replied dodu thinking about such things on an empty stomach can cause a man to forget what he is doing our shadows were long on the hilltop as we rose to take up the ropes for the last time with groans and moans and much gritting of teeth we eased the boatladen wagon down the slope one step at a time with each step the farm holding came nearer and i could almost taste the ale in the jar i was jolted out of this pleasant anticipation when sarn struck his foot against a stone and fell i heard him cry out and saw him sprawling in the dust the rope flying from his hands suddenly unbalanced dodu stopped and reared back with all his might unfortunately he could not hold the weight by himself and was jerked off his feet before i knew it padraig and i were plummeting down the hill trying desperately to slow the freewheeling wagon roupen dashed to our aid he ran up and shoved the tree branch in front of the wheels but the wagon was already moving too fast the wheels bumped over the branch and kept on rolling there was nothing for it but to throw off the ropes and save ourselves padraig stumbled still clinging to the rope and was dragged through the dust let go padraig i shouted releasing my grip the boat sped down the slope rattling and creaking as it bumped over the closerutted road faster and faster it fell slewing this way and that gathering pace with astonishing swiftness as it careened down the hill padraig climbed to his feet and brushed himself off pray god it does not hit the house he said even as he spoke one of the wagon wheels struck the side of the rut the front wheels bounced and turned sending the wagon onto a new coursestraight for the nearest dwelling padraig raced past me shouting with all his might danger he cried danger get out of the way what anyone might have made of this warning i cannot say but suddenly we were all flying down the hill after the runaway boat despite our fatigue and aching muscles we ran like madmen for the settlement shouting for all we were worth danger get away the onrushing wagon struck a bump in the road and veered into the long grass growing beside the road the grass brushed against the hull of the boat and slowed the plummeting wagon somewhat a stone wall forming part of the pig enclosure stood beside the house the wagon ploughed through the grass scraping the side of the boat against the wall knocking two or three tiers of stone from the top this slowed the wagon furtherbut not enough to prevent the impending collision the keel of the boat hit the midden heap showering dung and debris into the air the wagon bounded into the air and came down with a terrible crash as it drove into the side of the house padraig was the first to reach the wreckage he put his head through the hole in the wall and called to see if anyone was hurt i was next to reach the house i do not think anyone is here he said turning to me sarn two steps behind me came running up is the boat damaged he climbed up onto the hull and looked inside roupen his thin limbs trembling with excitement came to stand beside me never in my life have i seen such a thing he said his voice quavering as he gulped down air it was he paused to find the word he wanted magnificent the hull is unharmed announced sarn much relieved i wonder where everyone has gone said padraig moving around the corner of the house to search the yard on the other side is no one here asked roupen he put his head in through the collapsed wall looked quickly and then said that is a mercy someone might have been killed sarn climbed out of the boat and began examining the place where the hull had scraped against the wall padraig reappeared to tell us that there were no animals in the pens or in the barn and no one in the fields behind the houses then he disappeared again to search the buildings across the road is there any ale asked dodu strolling up at last redfaced and puffing from the unaccustomed exertion he sat down on the rim of a wagon wheel and drew his sleeve across his sweating face i am dying there is no one here i informed him impossible replied the haulier in all the years i have been coming this way there is always someone here look for yourself i said the house is empty and so are the fields padraig returned just then with a wooden bucket in his hands i found the well he said handing the bucket to me i passed it to roupen who put his face in the water and began slurping away while the bucket made its slow round i asked padraig what else he had discovered there is fodder in the crib he said and water in the trough there is grain in the storehouse we will have meal and water at least dodu moaned and shook his head sarn stepped around the stern of the boat and said bad luck the mast is broken the end splintered when it struck the house can it be repaired perhaps he said unhappily we will have to see he walked away shaking his head what should we do now asked roupen padraig has found meal and water i replied let us see if we can find anything else to eat while dodu and roupen searched the farm houses padraig and i set about making a fire in the yard i took wood from the pile beside the door and a flint and iron from inside the nowruined house while i struggled with lighting the fire padraig found a cooking pot and filled it with water from the well he took a quantity of ground meal from a bag in the storehouse and added it to the water he then brought the pot to me and when the fire was going sufficiently he placed it on the flames and sat down to keep watch over it dodu and roupen emerged from the neighbouring house the young lord with a small bag in one hand and a bowl in the other dodu carried a crock and a wooden cup i knew there would be ale he said placing the crock carefully at his feet he sat down and began to pour out the sweet brown liquid i found salt said roupen offering me the bag from the bowl he produced two large eggs and a wedge of hard milkywhite cheese he handed the eggs to padraig saying maybe we could boil them i have a better idea replied the monk taking the bowl from roupens hand he cracked the two eggs against the side and emptied them into the bowl then taking the cheese he broke off a portion and proceeded to crumble it into the bowl whereupon he reached in and stirred the eggs and cheese with his fingers very fast until the mixture was a pale yellow colour roupen watched fascinated are you a cook in your monastery padraig smiled the abbey is not large he explained so each of us must take his turn with the various chores so saying he upended the bowl into the cooking pot with the meal and water which was beginning to simmer on the flame he reached for the bag of salt withdrew a small handful and shook it into the pot as well now then he said taking up a stick from which he began stripping the bark we wait we passed the ale cup around the circle to occupy ourselves while we waited for the pot to boil sarn having decided that his mast might wait until he had a bite to eat joined us and demanded his share of the ale which dodu reluctantly supplied after a time the pot began to boil and padraig stirred it with his stick sarn went into the house to see if dodu had overlooked any jars of ale i lay back and closed my eyes and listened to the pot burbling away the smell of the porridge brought the water to my mouth and my stomach growled i was just remembering the last meal i had eaten before leaving home when i felt a touch on my arm i opened my eyes and saw roupen kneeling over me his eyes were on the yard behind us i rolled over and looked where he was staring and saw only the trees of the wood behind the field what do you see i asked someone is there he whispered padraig stopped stirring he placed the stick across the top of the pot and gazed into the deepshadowed wood are you certain i asked the young man nodded i stood and motioned padraig to my side we will go have a look you stay here and guard that pot i told roupen padraig and i walked to the end of the yard and started across the field watching the trees for any sign of movement but could see nothing in the shade we halted at the edge of the field and i called into the wood come out we have seen you there is nothing to fear we need your help come out so we can talk to you we waited no sound or movement came from the wood i started to shout again but padraig said let me try he advanced a few more paces alone and raised his hands in priestly blessing pax vobiscum in the name of our great redeemer i give you good greeting he paused and waited for a moment then added i have made a meal of porridge come and share it with us what are you doing i complained there is barely enough for us ignoring me padraig said the porridge is ready please come and eat we cannot feed the whole countryside i complained hush duncan be still the overgenerous monk repeated his invitation and we waited some more perhaps roupen was mistaken i thought no doubt hunger had him seeing things before i could suggest this to padraig however i heard a rustle in the leaves and out from the forest stepped a wizened old man with a small knife in one hand and a broken tree branch in the other his wrinkled face was set in a glare of defiance as he challenged us to do our worst twelve peace father padraig said we are pilgrims and mean no harm the old man came on a pace or two further and then halted he raised the broken branch in his hand and pointed it at padraig are you a priest truly he asked in crude latin i am replied padraig still holding out his hands come let us break bread together and you can tell us what happened here the man threw down his rude weapon and gave a nod of approval to the two old women cowering behind him all is well he called that one is a priest at this the women ran forwards and fell upon padraig they seized his hands and began kissing them and crying aloud praises to god the monk allowed himself to be handled for a moment and then turned and herded his new flock towards the house upon reaching the yard they went at once to where roupen was waiting beside the pot of porridge and stood looking longingly at the steaming bubbling food sarn and dodu appeared just then having searched the second house to no avail the old people recognized the haulier and ran to him dodu dodu they cried and began gabbling at him in a strange language he patted them on the shoulders and listened his expression growing sorrowful finally he raised his head and said to us they have been robbed two days ago no doubt it was the same bandits we met on the road dodu listened some more and then said they took all the pigssix of them you knowand the two cows as well annas husband tried to prevent them and they thumped him on the head the old man made a motion with his hand showing how the blow had struck his friend his mouth turned down in a frown of sorrow and disgust he died yesterday said dodu exchanging a few more words with the old farmer he added sadly they buried him in the woods beside the stream where they have been hiding the old women nodded vigorously and pointed to the woods behind them it seems they had seen us coming down the hill and fearing another attack had run into the woods that had probably saved them from injury when the boat came crashing through their house i pointed this out and then led them to the side of the house and showed them the wreckage they clucked their tongues and muttered to one another but allinall appeared far more interested in the porridge than the ruin of their poor dwelling one of the old wives crawled into the house through the hole in the wall and began rummaging around in the debris she brought out some wooden bowls and passed them to her friend from another corner she produced a bag and passed that to me when i opened it i found hard bread in small loaves next she found a wooden ladle which she carried to the boiling pot and with a flick of her hand dismissed roupen from his post settling herself beside the pot she dipped in the ladle blew on the food to cool it and then tasted she puckered her lips and then called a command to the old man who hurried away at a trot he went to the storehouse and disappeared inside emerging a few moments later carrying a brown bundle the size of a baby which he brought to his wife she lay the bundle in her lap and unwrapped the cloth to reveal a fine side of smokecured bacon taking a small knife from her sleeve she began cutting off strips of meat and dropping them into the porridge next the old man produced two onions which she also cut up and stirred into the pot with the ladle in a little while the aroma wafting up from the pot had improved marvellously the old woman tasted again then smiled a wide gaptoothed grin and we all took up our bowls and gathered around as she ladled out the thick stew we crumbled the hard bread into the steaming porridge raised the bowls to our lips and lapped up our first meal in three days there was enough to ease the hunger pangs and give us strength to pull the wagon away from the house we spent the rest of the day helping clean up the wreckage and moving their few belongings to the other house which owing to a hole in the roof they had not been using for several years that night the old women made flat bread on the hearthstones and stewed bacon in ale they then wrapped the strips of meat in the bread and gave them to us to eat like that it was simple fare but good and filling and we slept that night without the gnawing ache in our stomachsexcept for roupen whose unsteady stomach could not abide such rough food he ate with us but paid the price with pains and bloaty farting which kept him wakeful and miserable all night early the next morning while the others slept padraig and i set off for the mill on the sane i had decided that our best hope lay in getting to the river head as soon as possible if we were lucky we might persuade one of the hauliers to leave the river and return with us to retrieve our boat how to pay for this service was a vexing problem but inasmuch as we had according to dodu at least a threeday walk ahead of us i was confident we would think of something along the way in any event it was abundantly clear there was no help for us at the settlement they were poor farmers made all the poorer by the cruel robbery of their livestock and few pitiful belongings even to stay with them put that much more strain on their already fragile resources indeed it would be enough of a hardship feeding those who remained behind sarn and dodu to guard the boat and roupen to rest and strengthen himself at least sarn and dodu would work for their food for i had promised the farmer while we were away the two men would repair the damage done to their little house roupen however i advised to take his ease on the evidence of his indigestion the previous night it was clear that he was far from fully recovered from the illness that had taken the lives of his friends what little strength he had gained while on the river had been spent in dragging the boat up and down the hills i thought a few days idleness would stand him in good stead he had other ideas however which i discovered when padraig and i stopped to rest at midday the old wives had sent us off with a bag of bread and two skins of water after walking briskly through the morning pausing only once for water we stopped beside the road for a bite to eat we were sharing a bit of bread and talking when roupen suddenly came into view on the road behind us as soon as he came close enough for speech i stood and said i thought we agreed you would stay with the others is something wrong no lord he said i thought you might be needing my help i thanked him for the thought and said as it is padraig and i are perfectly capable of dealing with the hauliers you may as well rest and take your ease for the journey to come no doubt your powers of persuasion rival those of great moses himself replied the young lord but unless the hauliers of the saone are very different from those we have seen so far he replied i think it unlikely you will convince them to work for you without pay i allowed that this was true and pointed out that he had lost his purse to the bandits as well since you have no money i cannot see how you mean to help in the matter the thin young man smiled at this and raised his fist in the air he came forwards until his hand was before my eyes then he opened his fingers to reveal the large gold ring he had been wearing on his thumb the night we were robbed i thought they took everything from you i said i saw them search you i hid it in my mouth the moment padraig wakened me he smiled suddenly and i saw a boldness in him i had not seen before and if they had searched me better i would have swallowed it it came into my mind that here was a young man who perhaps for the first time in his life was truly enjoying himself content no longer to be left behind he had followed us half the day just to take part in whatever would happen next sending him back would be a rejection not easily forgiven since it obviously meant so much to him i relented come along then i said passing him my waterskin and a piece of bread we will be glad of the company so it was that three of us entered the little mill town on the saone three days later the settlement was well placed at a bend in the river with the mill up river of the town above the mill the stream coursed over the stones of a narrow rocky ford too rough and shallow for boats below the settlement however it widened into a navigable stream once more looking down into the valley from the hillside we could see several boats in the water although whether these were arriving or departing we could not tell i determined to waste no time but to get down to the water straightaway and talk to the hauliers to see how matters stood the road led first to the mill so we passed by quickly and on towards the settlement as we hurried past roupen halted in the road and turned around padraig and i walked on a few paces before realizing he was no longer with us i cast a glance over my shoulder and saw him standing stock still and staring into the field beside the mill where the miller kept his oxen and cattle the field was small and surrounded by a low stone wall two cows and a pair of oxen stood at the end nearest the mill i called to roupen and when he made no answer padraig said he has seen something still anxious to hasten on and speak to the hauliers i resented having to stop with our destination so near what is it i demanded irritably without taking his eyes from the field he raised a hand and pointed to the cattle those are dodus oxen the young lord said i looked across at the two big animals standing in the field and said let us not judge hastily after all one ox looks very much like another they are roupen insisted i walked behind them long enough to know pointing to the two milk cows he added and i suspect those cows belong to the farmer i glanced at padraig who shrugged unhelpfully and said even if what you say is true i cannot see what we can do about it we have other before i could finish there came a prodigious squealing from somewhere behind the mill roupen started towards the sound someone is being killed he said aye agreed padraig mildly a pig the squeal came again more frenzied more terrible the unfortunate creature was suffering dreadfully and still its agonies were not cut short for a slaughtering i remarked it is poorly done and unless they do things differently here it is very early in the year to butcher your pigs unless added roupen they are not your pigs with that we started back along the road towards the milla huge wooden structure of hewn oak beams infilled with river stone set in mortar a great wooden water wheel turned slowly in the stream gushing from the rocky ford the yard was wide and covered with flagstone so the fullyladen wagons would not become enmired when it rained that stone paving however was the solitary gesture towards order or cleanliness as we drew closer the stink of the place hit us full in the face dung and rancid straw stood in mucky heaps either side of the low barn adjoining the house filling the air with a sour stench to make the eyes water and the gorge rise mounds of human excrement were piled on the ground beneath the upper windows of the millhouse and dog dirt was scattered over the yardalong with horse manure left where the dray animals had dropped it our miller is a very earthy fellow observed padraig the house itself was in need of repair the roof had once been handsome red tiles but many of these were missingand indeed quite a few lay smashed in the yardthough some had been replaced with illfitting chunks of flat stone the mill wheel was green with moss which clung in dripping slimy beards from the spokes and paddles the door of the barn had fallen off and was leaning against one wall and the wall of the ox pen was collapsed the gap repaired not with the stone which still lay on the ground but with tree branches and bits of rope a pair of bony thinshanked brown oxen stood with their heads down lacking i expect the strength to move sharing the toosmall pen were five fat pigs laying in the dung their feet bound at the far end of the yard lay an enormous round grinding stone which was turned by means of a pole attached to a centre post if not for the four men standing nearby i would have thought the mill derelict and abandoned but i saw the old grindstone and realized that this was what dodu had been talking about when he said the miller kept oxen when dry summer turned the stream to a bare trickle no longer capable of turning the great water wheel the miller hitched his beasts to the grindstone and kept his customers supplied the men were completely engrossed in the activity before them and took no notice of us as we strolled into the reeking yard another sharp pig squeal tore the air with a distressingly human scream and a sick feeling spread through me as sight confirmed what i had already guessed was taking place a young boyperhaps eight or ten years oldarmed with a spear was making sport of killing the poor pig encouraged by those who stood cheering his efforts the boy was enthusiastically torturing the animal he had already put out both eyes and carved a long bloody slice of hide from the back now he had the spear thrust up the wretched creatures backside and was jerking the shaft back and forth while the bawling pig its feet tied so it could not escape spewed blood from its mouth as it shrieked the expression of demented glee on the boys face filled me with cold rage that this should be allowed was abhorrent that it should be encouraged was monstrous i started forwards and felt padraigs hand on my arm pulling me back be careful he warned there is great evil in this place shaking off his hand i said they should be punished for what they are doing they will be punished never doubt it he assured me but you may not be the instrument of that punishment god i think has other plans for you then what would you have me do i demanded it may be our presence will suffice to shame them he said and if not it is in gods hands duncan he stared at me truly oh very well i relented i took a deep breath and put aside my anger when i had calmed myself once more i proceeded towards the men calling out to let them know we were there at my greeting one of the men turned slowly and regarded us with dull malevolence what do you want he said his deep voice sharp with irritation at having been interrupted in his pleasure behind me i heard roupen gasp and whisper to padraig it is the bandit who robbed us although i was taken aback quite as much as roupen i could not allow the man to see that i recognized him so i said we have come to ask if you have any oxen we might borrow for a day or two ask a haulier he grunted turning away again i grind grain for my pay you see i persisted moving nearer we have had a slight misfortune on the road if we could persuade you to lend us two of your oxen all would be well we could pay you for your trouble the big man spun around angrily and are you deaf as well as stupid he growled spittle flying from his fleshy lips at his shout two of the men with him turned one of them bent down and picked up a chunk of wood which was lying beside the grindstone hefting it like a club i would not ask i told the man if need were not great a few days no moreand the beasts would be well treated i said this last to embarrass him but he took no notice this is a mill not a stable he roared get you gone before i set the dogs on you he kicked at a lump of dog dirt and sent it flying at me the man with the chunk of wood raised it in the air and made as if he would attack since there was nothing to be gained by provoking them further i quickly retreated i had taken but a step or two when i felt a sharp thump on my back as the wood chunk struck me between the shoulder blades i did not look back but straightened and continued on to the sound of the miller and his friends laughing at me well demanded the young lord as i rejoined them was he the man who robbed us no i told him this man is older and heavier even so the resemblance is too strong to be happenstance padraig nodded in agreement brothers then that is my guess i said be they brothers sisters or husband and wife snarled roupen with unusual fury i say those piebald oxen belong to dodu and the pigs were stolen from the farmer peace i told him as day follows night i am certain of it then why are we running away we are not running away i replied starting off once more we are going to find a place to rest rest he fumed while they laugh at us and torture those animals with impunity no i said while we wait for darkness to befriend us roupen frowned with dissatisfaction cowards he muttered padraig stepped close he means explained the monk resting his hand on the young mans shoulder that having been as meek as doves now we will become as shrewd as serpents to bring a measure of justice to bear on the crimes of these wicked men we gave the brute a chance to treat us courteously and fairly i said now we will do business in a way he understands what are you going to do asked roupen wait and see i told him striding on thirteen we laid up in a neighbouring field under a rack of drying hay dozing on and off through the long afternoon the rest through the heat of the day was welcome and it was not until the sun began to set that we stirred i had taken the measure of the millhouse and yard and knew how i wished to proceed my only worry was the dogs the miller had mentioned although i had not seen the beasts i had seen ample sign of them in the lumps of dung scattered across the filthcovered yard i did not know how many there might be nor whether they were large and fierce or small and noisy the oxen will trouble us not at all i told my fellowthieves it is the pigs that will prove difficult even if we can avoid rousing the dogs the pigs will squeal as soon as we go among them we talked about this for a time and then padraig said leave the pigs to me i will take care of them with that he rose and walked out into the field where he lay down on his stomach and stretched out his arms on either side what is he doing wondered roupen praying i said for pigs for all of us in a little while the last of the daylight faded and a fine blue twilight descended over us i lay back and listened as night gathered the little river settlement to its sleep from the trees along the river came the raucous chatter of rooks in their high nests and from the surrounding fields the homely sound of cattle lowing as they trailed towards barn and byre here and there dogs barking and the rusty clinking of goat bells when at last darkness grew full we set to work setting roupen on the road to watch between the mill and settlement should anyone come along padraig and i hurried to the field where dodus oxen were being held it was as i expected the wall was illmade and halffalling down and the animals had not been stabled for the night nor cared for in any way but merely left out in the field to browse as they would we quickly found a weak place in the wall leaned hard against it and pushed it down we then began shifting the fallen stones to clear a path through the breach thus we had only to remove enough stones to lead the oxen out and our aim was swiftly accomplished hurrying into the field i loosed the patient beasts hobbles and led them out while padraig followed with the milk cows rejoining roupen on the road i said we have what we came for we can leave now and all will be well if we proceed any further we may lose everything i looked at my fellowconspirators what is it to be if you do not free those pigs i will declared roupen firmly it is not right those rogues should prosper so the pigs are nothing to us padraig pointed out but they are life or death for the farmer and his wife and sister i think we should try very well i said we are agreed whatever happens there will be no looking back in regret turning to the young lord i said lead the cattle away we will join you on the road i am going with you he replied oxen are slow and easily overtaken i told him patiently if we are followed it would be well if you were out of sight i am going with you roupen repeated crossing his arms over his chest before i could object further padraig raised his hand let us go together if trouble arises we may have need of another pair of hands seeing i was outnumbered i surrendered tethering the animals beside the road we started for the mill coming to the edge of the yard we halted to listen all was quiet in the holding save for the slow creaking scrape of the water wheel as it turned in the stream no light shone from inside the house the moon was rising casting a thin watery light over the empty yard i could see the ox pen with the starving oxen in it and the dark shapes of the five remaining pigs i do not see any dogs i whispered they must be inside or sleeping suggested roupen either way we must go quietly so we do not wake them we moved with all stealth across the yard the stink of the place struck me like a slap in the face a pile of entrails and offal marked the place where the pig had been killed and these added their sicksweet pungence to the heady reek we made short work of dismantling the decrepit enclosureindeed we had to be careful the wall did not collapse of its own and the resulting crash wake the miller and his dogs when we had opened a sizeable breach i turned to padraig if you know any runes for silencing pigs i whispered say them now to my surprise he said i have already done so he then instructed roupen and me to move well away and remain still then stepping to the breached wall the canny monk paused pressed his hands together and bowed his head after a moment he crossed himself and entered the pen he proceeded to go among the pigs stooping over them to unbind their feet and moving on speaking softly to them all the while he soon had them on their feet and then with a gentle urging led them out into the yard they followed at his heels like faithful dogs he did not stop as he passed us but walked briskly from the yard and out onto the roadand even then he did not stop but continued walking back the way we had come casting a last glance at the millhouse to see if we had been discovered i said to roupen we had best hurry and fetch the cattle or padraig and his pigs will leave us behind the moon had risen higher and the road stretched out before us as a softly glowing stream undulating its way into the hills by the time we got the cattle moving padraig was far ahead i could see him striding along surrounded by his little band of swine trotting contentedly with him it seems a strange thing to say but i have known padraig since he came to the abbey as a stripling youth and hardly a day has passed since our first meeting when i have not seen or spoken to him even so i was always discovering new and curious things about him his ability to amaze was in itself amazing in this respect he was like his uncle abbot emlyn who with a word or act regularly astonished the settlement it was as if a spring from which one drew water every day continually revealed hidden depths they were celts of course and this accounted for part of it the abbey and its teaching was also partly responsible how much i had no way of knowing but gait i was very soon to discover that the abbey of saint andrew was responsible for a great deal more than the peculiarities of a few of its clerics once over the first hill and out of sight of the mill padraig stopped and allowed us to catch him he stood in the road surrounded by his herd as if by an adoring congregation i would have waited for you he said but i did not know how long the rune would hold i thought it best to keep moving until we were well away from that vile house how did you do it wondered roupen if they had been mice they could not have been more quiet i told them i was taking them home the monk explained i asked them to be quiet so that the evil men who lived in the house would not come and stop us you did well i told him no one awoke and not so much as a snort from a sleeping dog and yet said padraig looking down the road behind us you were followed i turned around expecting the worst and saw instead the two forlornlooking oxen ambling along behind us i suppose they had wandered through the hole in the pen and seeing the other cattle had simply followed the herd what should we do asked roupen while i did not relish the possibility of being caught with them the others were being returned to their rightful owners after alli could not bring myself to take them back if they want to follow us i cannot see how we can prevent them anyway it would be cruelty itself to leave them in that place we walked until almost sunrise and then began looking for a place to spend the day i had already decided that the wisest course would be to rest the following day and travel at night i reckoned that the miller would discover his stolen livestock missing the next morning and come looking for them i had seen no horses at the mill either in the fields or in the barn but his thieving brother had horses and if summoned would quickly overtake us at the bottom of one of the next hills i found what i was looking for a clump of trees no great distance from the road yet tucked around the shoulder of the hillside mostly out of sight so while padraig and roupen led the animals into the wood i pulled off a few branches from a broomlike bush and walking back the top of the hill began sweeping away the animal tracks in the dust the sun was rising when i finished and taking a last look behind me i ran for the shelter of the grove it was made up of beech trees mostly and although the nuts were not yet ripe we pulled down a few branches for the pigs to chew on before settling back to rest and wait we will continue on at dusk i said passing the water skin to roupen we will have to take it in turns to watch the animals so they do not wander away padraig took the first watch and roupen the second i went to sleep and woke around midday to the sound of tapping after a quick look around i found roupen sitting on a rock with a stick in his hand he was flicking the stick against the side of the rock as he watched the swine rooting for their food where is padraig i asked he said he heard something and went to look at the road the young lord replied with a yawn raising the stick he pointed out the way i ran back through the wood and joined padraig as he was leaning against a tree see anything i asked two men on horseback passed a little while ago he said i asked if it was anyone we knew it is difficult to say but i think one of them we have seen before we waited there and in a little while i heard the steady rhythmic clop of horses hooves the two riders appeared a few moments later riding easily heads down looking for tracks they have followed us this far i said let us pray they follow us no further as padraig had said one of the riders did indeed have a familiar look about him although it was hard to tell from our vantage point i would have guessed it was the bandit chief himself the two passed the place where we had gone off the road slowed and halted a little way along where the track began to rise to meet the hill they sat for a time looking this way and that while we watched from behind our tree in the end the riders lifted the reins and moved on we watched until they were out of sight but remained alert after that aside from a shepherd leading a flock of sheep and goats we saw no one else on the road the rest of the day and at dusk we gathered our herd and took to the road once more we walked through the night without encountering anything more troublesome than a foultempered badger who thought himself lord of the high way dodu was overjoyed to have his oxen back and the farmers were astonished to see the pigs and cattle returned like most peasants they were intimately acquainted with hardship but strangers to good fortune consequently they did not know what to make of the sudden increase in their meagre wealth they blinked their eyes and shook their heads as they patted the animals with their hands all the while remarking how they had never witnessed such a miracle i decided that they should have the extra pair of oxen once the animals were fattened and their strength restored they would be useful for pulling and ploughing when i told him this tears came to the old farmers eyes unable to speak he seized my hand and began kissing it over and over to dodu i said please tell him the oxen are not a gift i merely repay the generosity of his hearth and a modicum of compensation for nearly destroying his house dodu repeated my words at which the farmer embarrassed by my simple praise bowed his head and shuffled away to look after his new animals afterward dodu came and told me that the farmers had been using the milk cows to prepare their fields for planting and he said when the animals tired they pulled the plough themselves last year they were not able to plant both fields he smiled and added i think you have saved their lives with your gift in the few days we had been away sarn had not only repaired the gaping hole in the house but the broken mast as well despite the crudeness of his tools he declared himself satisfied with the result the mast is shorter now he pointed out but it will serve i commended him on his handiwork and told him what had happened at the mill we will have to be careful on returning let them try to make trouble for us he muttered i would like to have that thief before me then he would feel the fury of a true norseman next morning we took our leave of the farmer the women sent us off with little loaves of bread and a fairsized piece of bacon this they put in a bag which they pressed into dodus hands before scuttling off without a word they watched us from the doorway of their newlyrepaired house three days later we descended the hill overlooking the settlement on the saone i considered trying to go around the mill and come to the river by some other way but there were no other trails so we strode out boldly and moved as quickly as possible to the hauliers landing on passing the mill i allowed myself a sideways glance to see if we were discovered but the house and yard were quiet there was no one about the landing was empty too so we wasted not a moment getting the boat back into the water while dodu and his oxen practised their trade roupen walked into the town to barter with the merchants for needed supplies a short while later the boat was ready and i was anxious to be away lest the miller or his thieving brother become aware of our presence in the settlement but the young lord had still not returned what can be keeping him i muttered and commanding sarn and padraig to remain in the boat and be ready to push off as soon as we returned i went off in search of him i had no difficulty finding him for as i made my way along the narrow track between the houses of the town i heard a commotion of angry voices as i entered the bare earth expanse which served as the market square for the settlement a well stood in the centre of the square and around it the stalls and wagons of the areas merchants and farmers hurrying into the square i saw a number of people gathered beside the well they were shouting at something which was taking place before them i hurried closer and heard the riffling smack of the lash on flesh and the groan that followed pushing through the crowd i stepped into the ring and said in a loud voice unless you wish to suck your supper through broken teeth the rest of your life i urge you to put down that strap the thug hesitated in midstroke and turned slowly roupen lay at his feet cowering red welts on his arms where he had covered his head the crowd fell silent as i stepped forwards intent only on stopping the beating i had no wish to fight nor any weapon with which to back up my rash challenge you the ruffian said recognizing me at once though it had been dark on the road that night i knew him too the thief so cheerful before was angry now and all the more dangerous for it step closer he said and i will give you some of what your jew is having and then we will discuss the cattle i am missing i made no move let him go i said you can have no quarrel with him he has done nothing to you someone from the crowd hollered hes a stinking jew he stole a gold ring and tried to sell it he is not a jew i told the crowd he is a christian what is more he is the son of leo prince of armenia whose ring he wears the very man this town must answer to if you harm his son and heir i paused to allow them to consider this then added prince leo commands ten thousand soldiers while you have none unless you count this brute i see before me a murmur of uncertainty rippled through the crowdno longer so enthusiastic in their support of the beating as they were only moments before one or two of the more timid among them crept away quietly and who are you demanded the thief to concern yourself with him i am his protector i replied ignoring the thug i moved to roupens side and bent over hum can you stand my lord still cowering he nodded very well let us be about our business the rogue attacked in the same instant i expected he would strike me then and i was ready he charged from the blind side arms outstretched to seize me in a crushing embrace i remained crouching and let him come on at the last instant i lowered my shoulder and slammed into him with all my weight i caught him under the ribs driving the air from his lungs he fell sprawling backwards onto the hardpacked dirt not caring to prolong the ordeal i leapt on him in the same instant placing my knee on his throat unable to breathe he squirmed and thrashed while the colour of his face slowly deepened from red to blue do not kill him someone shouted i raised my head and looked at the crowd you were all for a killing when you thought it was a jew being murdered i give this rogue a taste of his own stew and you cry mercy for him would that you had done so for the innocent stranger among you the ruffian ceased struggling beneath me his eyelids fluttered and his eyes rolled up into his skull and his limbs went slack only then did i release my hold on him i stood slowly murder someone gasped he killed garbus this ugly fellow is not dead i told them he is merely asleep although perhaps it would be better for this town if it were otherwise i stooped down and tucking my fingers under the brutes belt lifted upward sharply this action produced two striking effects the thief suddenly moaned as the air rushed back into his lungs and the gold ring slipped from its hiding place beneath the belt and fell out upon the groundto the astonishment of the townspeople looking on i picked up the ring and handed it to roupen come my lord the boat is waiting we will shake the dust of this place from our feet i put my arm around his shoulder and drew him away what about the supplies roupen asked as we walked from the square there will be another settlement down river i told him we will buy what we need there i want nothing more to do with this place upon returning to the boat i bade dodu the haulier farewell he was sorry to see us go and said that if he did not have a wife and son waiting for him at home he would count it a blessing to go on pilgrimage with us to the holy land i told him we would ask for him on our way home after all i still owe you for hauling the boat no no he cried you saved my good oxen i should pay you nevertheless i said i will look forwards to paying this debt until then my friend i wish you well some of the more curious townspeople had followed us to the landing as sarn pushed the boat out into the slowmoving stream padraig addressed the onlookers pointing to dodu he said this man is a friend of mine from now on you will treat him like a brother for i will return one day and if i learn he has been abused in any way by anyone here i will call down the wrath of god upon this place do not think you will escape judgement for your sins the people gaped at ire aghast at this startling pronouncement the current carried the boat away and we left them standing on the landing looking after us in wonder roupen too was more than a little awestruck once we were safely down stream he pulled the ring from his finger and offered it to me saying you saved my life at risk of your own my father will reward you greatly consider this token but a small foretaste of the treasure to come i thanked him for his thoughtfulness but declined saying if i take your ring you will have nothing with which to buy supplies in the next settlement that is the agreement we made true he agreed reluctantly slipping on the ring once more even so i will remain in your debt until the honour of our family is discharged fourteen the next settlement was two days down river we were hungry again by then but god is good we arrived at midday on market day and the market was lively and wellsupplied the merchants eager for trade in exchange for roupens ring we got two bags of ground meal a haunch of salt pork five loaves of bread half a wheel of hard cheese a few strips of dried beef and various other provisions such as eggs nuts dried peas and salt fish we also bought a cask of cider which the hardy folk of the region drink almost to the exclusion of all else we might have got more for the gold somewhere elsefor all it was a very fine ringbut we were already feeling the pinch and did not know how far the next market might be also with space already cramped it would not have helped us to capsize our craft we bargained hard and were able to come away with our provisions but nothing left over while sarn and padraig stowed everything aboard the boat roupen and i went to inquire of the way ahead although the young lord had come up the river and knew the general route he could not remember how many days the journey required it is perhaps nine days said the merchant i asked this time of year of course he tapped his front teeth with a dirty fingernail when the water is low i suppose it might take longer we thanked him for this information and turned to leave he called us back saying there is no difficulty mind just keep to the main channel until you come to lyon where the river joins with another and changes its name what does it become the rhone he said just keep to the main channel and you will have no difficulty after that i should know i have been to lyon often enough but we want to go to marseilles i pointed out is it much further after that oh aye if i were you i would forget all about marseilles and go to lyon instead it is better in every way i always enjoy very good trade in lyon the people there are very wealthy not like here mind still i make no complaint the people here are hardworking and know the value of their goods again we thanked him for providing such excellent advice and made to leave whereupon he said after lyon you are only seven days or perhaps eight as i sayfrom avignon and from there it is but a short distance to marseilles by sea you should stay a few days if you can the cathedral is splendidor will be when it is finished they have only begun mind but already it is a sight worth seeing even paris has not such a grand cathedral padraig and i walked back to the boat our young lord roupen might have warned us it was so far he doesnt seem to remember anything about the journey at all do you regret taking him with us asked the priest i thought about it for a moment noat least not yet i replied but we are still a long way from marseilles it was as the merchant saidwe reached lyon without trouble four days later and six days after that avignonwhich i was disappointed to learn was nowhere near the sea our destination was still many days off feeling that time was pressing we journeyed on without even so much as a glance at the city or its splendid cathedral it was late in the day when we reached the first shoal south of the city and decided to camp for the night and begin our exertions afresh in the morning we stopped at a place where the bull rushes grew tall forming a high green palisade around us we pulled the boat up onto the gravel shingle and padraig set about making supper with the little that remained of our onceplentiful supplies no sooner had we sat down to eat however than we were attacked and overwhelmed by dense clouds of biting midges despite the smoke from the fire which usually kept such pests at bay these fierce flyers swarmed over us biting each time they alighted more demon than insect their constant stinging soon drove us from our food in order to get some relief we rolled ourselves in our cloaks head to foot and finished our meal in sweltering misery we then lay down to sleep though the air was quite warm and the sky was still light all night long i lay with my face covered scarcely able to breathe the perpetual buzzing in my ears we all woke early illrested and itching from a thousand tiny sores which the midges had inflicted not wishing to linger even a moment we did not pause to break fast but straightaway seized the ropes and began pulling the boat over the gravel shoal eager to get as far away from that place as quickly as possible it was hot work and stinking tooowing to the numerous pools of stagnant water lying in the hollows of the sandbars the everpresent reek of the warm slimegreen water filled our nostrils driving all thoughts of food from our heads so aside from pausing now and then to swallow a few mouthfuls of water we took no meals there was little left of our provisions and the smell and flies took away any desire to eat so we pushed on and ever on shouldering the ropes and towing the boat through the heat of the day unfortunately when the sun began to descend in the west and loosen its grip on the land then the midges came seeking our blood once more we spent another endless insufferable night wrapped in our cloaks anyone stumbling upon our camp in the night would have imagined we had all been slain and prepared for burial in our shrouds after three days of fighting a losing battle against the vicious midges we at last entered a deeper channel and though there was only the slightest most hesitant breath of a breeze sarn raised the sail so that we might leave the plague of pests far behind as swiftly as possible downstream we stopped long enough to prepare one final meagre supper with the last of our provisionsa gruel of flaked dried meat and meal which like starving dogs we devoured instantly we licked the bowls clean and journeyed on the channel was good and the moon bright so we sailed through the night and arrived at aries late the next daytired sore very hungry and with no money to buy food it was beneath my dignity to beg although if it came to that i would so humble myself roupen said he would rather starve than beg and sarn said that since we were already starving he did not see that begging made any difference one way or the other beyond that i said i reckon our best hope lies in reaching marseilles as soon as possible and beseeching the templars to take pity on us padraig however had other ideas it may be the templars will aid us he allowed indifferently when i suggested it although i do not see why they should if you have something better to offer i am waiting to hear it i cupped a hand to my ear and leaned towards him well i am still waiting if you would cease your yammering you might hear something worthwhile he replied testily as it happens your father stopped here on his way to the holy landor have you forgotten i had forgotten then again owing to murdos reluctance to speak of his part in the great pilgrimage i knew little about the place to begin with most of what i had heard about aries i owed to emlyn who had also told padraigapparently far more than he had told me they wintered here i said remembering there is a monastery we could ask them for foodis that what you are thinking come i will show you what i am thinking he started off along the quay and i hurried after leaving roupen and sarn to refresh the water casks and make the boat fast padraig found his way to a market square near the harbour as in most settlements of any size there are always a fair number of elder citizens gathered around talking and taking their ease padraig greeted them respectfully and seeing we were strangers they wanted to know where we were coming from and where we were going he told them a little about our pilgrimage to the holy land and they all nodded earnestly they had heard of the great pilgrimage of course and several of them said they knew men who had participated and had stories to tell we listened and talked like this until they were well satisfied with our integrity and then padraig said my uncle wintered here on his way to the holy land he was a priest travelling with some norsemen perhaps some of you remember them the old men shook their heads no they did not remember but they were certain that such things did occur there was also an armourer who lived here he became friends with this mans father here the priest indicated me which impressed the choir of idlers enormously i wonder if he is still here our informants grew very excited not only was the fellow still there they said he was still doing a brisk business in weapons of all kinds and only for the noblemen of the region the templars have been here to see him one toothless fellow proclaimed proudly they are fighting priests you know only the best will do for them upon learning that we were on our way to marseilles to join the templar fleet we were enthusiastically informed that one of the templar ships had come into the harbour to receive the weapons which had been purchased the previous year they were returning to marseilles and were to set sail for the holy land in three days time how many days ago was this i asked four replied the old man they will have sailed by now if it is the templars you were hoping to find i fear you have missed them my friend one of the other men spoke up what are you thinking of arnal it was only two days ago the templars were here it was four days maintained the one called arnal i suppose you think i no longer know one day from another eh when did you ever know one day from another said his friend it was two days ago the templars were here i tell you charles remembers as well as i turning to a third old fellow he asked how many days since the templar ship had sailed the man leaned forwards on his stick thought for a moment opened his mouth then closed it thought some more and then said three days there you see cried arnal triumphantly i told you it was never two days where would we find this armourer i asked breaking into their deliberations maybe he could tell us more they told us how to find bezus forge and we thanked them for their inestimable help and hurried off in search of the smithy we passed the priory of saint trophime where as padraig remembered emlyn and his brother monks had passed many a dreary winter day in fiery debate with the priests of aries the day faded around us as we hurried through the narrow streets and pathways and into the old part of the city they said bezus forge was once a gatehouse used by the legion mused padraig pointing to a high stone wall rising broad and tall above the low rooftops of the houses clustered tight beneath it he said there it isand there is the smithy it was a solid stone edifice built into the wall we could see the place where the old doorway had been closed up with rubble stone black smoke issued from a squat chimney and the clang of hammer on anvil rang out from within the low wide door was open so the canny monk walked directly into the smithy and called to the proprietor telling him he had visitors who wished to make his acquaintance i stepped through the door to see a broadshouldered man with a thick beard his face red from the glowing iron in his hand his shirt was a filthy rag full of tiny burned holes from the sparks and bits of molten metal that flew from his hammer he regarded us without interest and went back to his pounding i felt a pang of disappointment are you bezu i asked but he made no reply instead my question was answered by a man who suddenly stepped from the darkness of the room behind the forge this fellow was short whitehaired plump and smiling cleanshaven his round face glowing with the heat from the forge fire he was dressed in a long mantle of fine cloth with a wide leather belt to which a fine slender sword was attached he regarded us with a kindly expression and said am balthazar of aries at your service my friends i begged his pardon and told him we were looking for the armourer named bezu my dear friends of whom i have many call me bezu he informed me you may do so if you wish it is an honour to meet you master bezu i told him i am duncan murdosson and this is my friend and companion brother padraig a man who travels in the company of a priest must either be very devout bezu observed cheerfully or else he is so wicked as to require continual observation and correction then again i suggested it may be such a man is merely on pilgrimage ah yes i expect that will be the likeliest explanation bezu laughed and said you were looking for me well here i am how can i help you i have come to meet you and to thank you i replied have you indeed he wondered i am happy to make your acquaintance sir but how is it that you should be thanking me once many years ago i explained you gave winter refuge to a young man like myself he was from the northern isles and on pilgrimage his name was murdo the old armourers faded eyes grew hazy as his mind raced back over the years you know he said his expression growing thoughtful i believe i did have a young helper by that name i have not thought about this for many years but now that you say it i remember this fellow why he was but a boy bezu regarded me closely as if trying to decide if he might know me even so why should this concern you my friend i smiled and said that young man you befriended is my father bezus eyes grew round he stared at me and shook his head in amazement your father you say none other i quickly explained that padraig was the nephew of one of the monks who had been travelling with my father and that as we happened to be passing through the city we could not ignore the chance to thank the armourer for his kindness all those years ago but it was nothing bezu protested he was cold and hungry i gave him a little food and a place to sleep he worked indeed i would he had stayed on he was a good worker that one and in those days when the great pilgrimage was just beginning had need of a young man or two to help me bezu grinned and shook his head again as if he had been struck a blow which made him dizzy with delight my friends he announced suddenly come and dine with me tonight we will have a feast in celebration of this glad meeting and you will tell me what has become of my hireling since i last laid eyes on him come my house is not far nothing would please me more than to break bread with you bezu i replied but we are with two others who are waiting for us at the harbour i quickly explained how we were even now hastening away to marseilles to meet the templar fleet the templars said bezu but some of them were here you know what have you to do with the soldiers of christ not wishing to prolong the tale i told him we were simply hoping to receive passage to the holy land aboard one of their ships they are sailing from marseilles in the next day or so we must hurry if we are to join them before they leave the old armourer nodded thoughtfully then rubbed his hands and declared but this is most fortuitous most fortuitous indeed you can help me with a problem which has vexed me greatly we would be only too glad to aid you in any way we can i replied adding provided of course we can still make it to marseilles before the fleet sails but that is the very thing bezu told me you see the templars were here as i said only a day or two ago they came to collect the weapons bespoken the previous year i have two other smithies now did you know we are kept busy morning to night all the year round the anvil is never silent well he said laying his hard hand on my arm confidentially they asked me to make some daggers for themspecial knives these are for the commanders come i will show you he turned and led us into to a tiny room carved out of the stone of the old roman wall pointing to a bright red rug which concealed an object in the middle of the floor he directed padraig to throw aside the covering the monk bent down and drew off the rug to reveal a small wooden casket bound in iron open it he said it is not locked padraig opened the box to reveal red silk cloth on which rested six exquisite daggers with blades of inlaid silver and handles of gold each had the distinctive templar cross on the end of the pommel with a small ruby at the centre they are superb knives i said i have never seen any to match them the armourer reached into the box took up one of the daggers yes they are very good he said feeling the heft and balance in his hand before passing it to me i do not do the gold work i have a friend of many yearsa craftsman without equala goldsmith he does the gold and silver and also engraving he like myself is run off his feet by the demand for his services he has not been well this year and the knives were not ready when the templars came he smiled quickly i told them i would bring them if they arrived before the fleet sailed but you are going to marseilles if you would consent to deliver the knives for me it would save me a great deal of trouble what do you say padraig glanced at me and nodded urging me to accept the commission very well i replied we would be honoured to serve you in this way leave it to us and worry no more about it ah sighed the armourer contentedly i feel better already i thank you now he declared rubbing his hands together to supper come with me and do not worry about your friends i will send one of my boys to the harbour to fetch them along so they can join us needless to say we accepted his invitation with unseemly eagerness and we all enjoyed a sumptuous meal at bezus grand house on the hill overlooking the town and harbour beyond night was far gone when we finally pushed away from the table made our farewells and returned to the boat we were therefore late rising the next morning while we were getting ready to cast off who should appear but our generous host himself carrying a large cloth bag ah i hoped i would find you here there was so much left over from last nights feast i thought you might like to have some of it on your journey he said passing the sack to sarn who promptly stowed it in the boat i also brought you this he pulled a small purse from beneath his belt and tossed it to me for delivering the knives i would have had to hire someone anyway so you might as well have it i was on the point of refusing to accept his money when padraig climbed out of the boat and embraced the old man bless you my friend he said may heavens rich light guide you always and may the lord of hosts greet you when you enter his kingdom he then made a little bow of respect bezu discomfited by this unexpected ritual blushed bright red and not knowing what to say or do in response simply pretended that it was a normal occurrence and smiled we made our farewells then and cast off the armourer stood on the quayside watching us away i waved to him and called a last farewell and then turned my face towards marseilles and hoped we were not already too late fifteen caitriona dearest heart of my heart we must take courage the day of dread is near the caliph has returned i have been told that he will soon summon me wazim kadi my amiable saracen jailer informs me that i am to prepare myself tomorrow or the day after i will be called before caliph alhafiz to answer for my crimes as i have said before and say again the outcome is certain death however holds no fear for me my only regret is that i will not see you again my soul i had hoped to have time enough to finish this my final testament yet it seems that in his wisdom our merciful redeemer has ordained otherwise i search through the pages i have written and my spirit grieves there is so much more that i wanted to say to you i despair to think what you will make of this fragmentary and insubstantial tale time was against me from the beginning i fear so perhaps i was fortunate to have written even the little you hold in your hands well no doubt all is as it was meant to be i can but give you what i have left and that is my everlasting love and this crude unfinished document which if nothing else will at least bear witness that in my last hours upon this earth i was thinking of you my beloved daughter wazim assures me that my letter will be treated with all respect i have the promise of the caliph that it will find its way to you i trust in this the word of the caliph is absolute nevertheless i have instructed faithful wazim that if any difficulty should arise the papyri should be given to the templars who one way or another will see that you receive it thus i can rest in peace assured that you will hear from your loving father againalbeit from beyond the grave as it were for by the time you receive this i will be long dead so here i must leave it a tale unfinished but for time i have prepared a second letter for my father and mother if by chance it fails to arrive with this one please tell your grandfather murdo that he was right about everything the holy land is a realm of demons and only madmen think to conquer it still i had to try farewell my love my light i pray our gracious king to send bright angels to surround you all the days of your life farewell part ii november papkos cyprus in the days and weeks following that fateful meeting of the inner circle i determined to educate myself in the crucial events taking place in the world around me inspired not to say alarmed by the vital importance of the work now before us i endeavoured to emulate the example of the others by learning all i could of the current social and political climate of europe and the west thinking a firm grasp on contemporary affairs would aid me in the coming battle the seven had other plans for me however as i was to discover one rainy afternoon in early spring a wintry gale was blowing cold off the north sea lashing the windows and making the lights flutter above my desk it was nearing closing time and i was not looking forward to braving the elements on my way home for the evening i heard footsteps outside my office shortly accompanied by a rapid knock enter i called glancing up as the door opened to my surprise it was pemberton and with him zaccaria i jumped to my feet at once for never had a single member of the brotherhood darkened my doorand now there were two gentlemen welcome come in i said rushing forth to relieve them of their dripping coats and hats it is beastly out there come in both of you and sit by the fire well have you dried out in no time thank you gordon said pemberton genially i hope you will forgive this intrusion intrusion not at all i replied pushing chairs towards the fireplace where the coals were glowing red and warm in the grate it is in fact a welcome break in the monotony that passes for studious industry in a legal firm you are most kind said zaccaria settling into the offered chair with a sigh he patted his face with a folded handkerchief to dry it i pulled my own chair from behind the desk and feeling slightly awkward playing the host i said may i offer you something to chase the chilla tot of brandy perhaps splendid said pemberton rubbing his hands to warm them just the thing i stepped to the tray of decanters on the sideboard and poured three small snifters of the firms tolerable brandy and passed them to my visitors slainte pemberton said raising his glass we sipped our drinks then and i took my seat and waited for them to reveal the reason for their visit no doubt you will recall that last time we met mention was made of shall we say the imperatives before us pemberton said settling his lean form back in his chair he cradled the bulbous glass in his long ringers as he swirled the aromatic amber liquid indeed yes i replied the dire warnings voiced in that meeting had scarcely been absent from my thoughts you were a classicist at university i believe said zaccaria suddenly a small energetic man of swarthy complexion and sturdy build he burns with a lively barely contained intensity many people mistake for giddiness why yes i allowed somewhat cautiously uncertain of the pertinence of this fact now that you mention it i was its been so long since anyone accused me of that i had all but forgotten history too isnt that correct i hope you havent spent too much effort rooting around in the hall of records im afraid my academic career does not make scintillating reading zaccaria smiled but did not disagree at least you showed a distinct affinity for the ancients rarely seen these days for that i commend you you will have studied latin pemberton said did you enjoy it after a fashion my tutor was a dry old stick prone to bouts of absentmindedness he should not shoulder all the blame however had i applied myself with a modicum of effort i might have made a better job of it still virgil cicero and julius caesar have stood by me through thick and thin also being in the legal profession i have the chance to brush up the odd phrase now and then what about greek ah no i replied greek was never my strong suit after a brief flirtation i abandoned the enterprise completely euripides almost did me in i managed enough to scrape by but only just i suspected as much mused zaccaria he made it sound as if he had long harboured grave misgivings about my natural parentage and patriotism then that is where we will begin said pemberton he tossed down the rest of his drink and set the glass aside we have been thinking it was time you were better acquainted with your heritage so to speak my greek heritage i said i wasnt aware i had any oh youd be surprised replied pemberton with a smile shake a family closet and you never know what might tumble out i think it more precise to say your greekspeaking heritage zaccaria said i am intrigued i said please continue the greek islands are pure enchantment have you ever been only by way of homer an excellent introduction to be sure but not a patch on the real thing i must say pemberton leaned forwards earnestly we have a challenge to set before you gordon would you like to hear it by all means i put aside my glass and gave him my full attention i imagined this unprecedented visit owed much to the new order anticipated by the inner circle and aware of the seriousness of our endeavour composed myself with all gravity for what was shortly to be asked of me we want you to learn greek greek the suggestion made me laugh out loud given the climate of danger into which we were descending i had anticipated a slightly more noble if not perilous undertaking whatever next do you think i am up to it i think you are more than up to it zaccaria assured me solemnly may i ask why you wish me to learn greek that need not concern you at the moment pemberton said brushing the question aside lightly lets just say that an opportunity has lately arisen which we are keen to have you exploit to the full to do that you will need a good working knowledge of greekboth antique and modern i looked from one to the other of them they were quite serious in fact pemberton regarded me with such intensity i began to suspect there was more to this proposal than i had been told so far the only way to find out more i understood was to accept what had been put before me nor was i inclined to turn down my first genuine assignment as a member of the inner circle in any case i would have agreed just to see what came next well why not i said at last yes of course ill do it with any luck ill be speaking like a native in no time at all that said pemberton dryly is about how long you have to master it sony you have from now to the end of september he said good heavens i counted quickly on my fingertips its less than six months if it were up to me i would give you as much time as you liked unfortunately we no longer have that luxury i see now why you called it a challenge i had i suppose imagined great deeds of high daring to answer the clarion call i had heard so clearly at the last meeting of the seven i had allowed myself to believe that when my turn came to serve it would involve something far more grand and exciting than stuffing my head full of ancient greek syntax to tell the truth i was slightly deflated pemberton astutely read the disappointment in my mood it is important gordon he said softly vitally so or i would not have asked you what is more you will learn much to your advantage that i promise quite agreed zaccaria now then he reached into his suit pocket and brought out a calling card i have taken the liberty of giving your name to an acquaintance of mine his name is rossides and he is a scholar of the first order he handed me the card he lives in lothian street near the university i took the card and read the name aloud m rossides d phil it was written in both greek and english do you think he would be inclined to take on a student of my low aptitude and qualification oh indeed zaccaria assured me seriously he has guided many a floundering odysseus through the scylla and charybdis of aspirated vowels and masculine verb forms if anyone can get you ready in time he can he reached out and tapped the card in my hand i dare say hell even get your latin back in fighting trim then i will certainly pay him a visit first chance i get ill send him my card and arrange a meeting next week he is expecting you tomorrow zaccaria informed me stroke of six dont be late the good professor expects punctuality in his students as if in anticipation of this meeting the clock in the hallway beyond chimed the hour and my two guests rose to leave you will want to be getting home i expect said pemberton give your lovely caitlin my best regards and tell her it might be a good idea to keep the autumn clear in the social diary he smiled enjoying his little mystery i have a feeling you two will be spending some time in sunnier climes sixteen i have seen the caliph all praise to our great redeemer i still live under sentence of imminent death it is true nevertheless it appears i am to be allowed to draw breath in this world another day for after the briefest of audiences i was returned to my rooms to pray for the salvation of my soul since i have every confidence in my redemption i will use this time to set down a little more of my tale so that you dear gait will have the benefit that said i looked over what i wrote yesterday and would not change a word it was as i said it would be a little after midday wazim came to my room daounk he said bowing low the hour has come his majesty the khalifa muhammad ibn alhafiz protector of the faithful and glorious potentate of cairo has commanded you to be brought before him to answer for your crimes this is how they talk daounk is the closest semblance to my name my little jailers saracen tongue could produce and this word hour is much liked by the arab tribes especially egyptians it is less easy to designate but if you quarter the day from sunrise to sunset and then divide each quarter into three you will have cut the daylight into twelve equal parts each one of these twelve parts is called an hour there are likewise twelve hours of darkness too and all of these have different names but i do not know them what is more arab philosophers employ various methods of counting these hours throughout the day and although the reason for this escapes me it does exercise them greatly what wazim meant of course was that my moment of judgement had come the men with him were dressed in the bold red and yellow of the palace guardsyellow siarcs and trousers with short red openfronted tunics and large turbansthat is war helms made of extremely long strips of cloth wound round and round the head in the most cunning fashion imaginable they carried the distinctive curved sword of the saracen in the winding cloth that serves the arab for a belt they also wielded long broadbladed pikes and curved knives in jewelled sheaths which were fastened to thick gold chains around their necks wazim bowed low as i rose and stepped forwards i had long ago decided not to argue with my captors or try to defend my actions in any way but to accept my portion with good cheer whatever befell me since i remained calm and selfpossessed the guards did not lay hand to me and i was permitted to walk upright and of my own volition into the caliphs presence i was taken to a region of the palace i had never visited before the corridors are wider the rooms more lavish than any i had seen heretofore with gold in endless supply gleaming in the furnishings and ornaments and even the cloth which covered the walls and floors the rooftrees are polished cedar the enormous doors are a dark hard wood called ebony black and shiny as polished jet the throne room itself is larger than any banqueting hall known in the west wazim told me that once in observance of the previous caliphs day of birth fifty men on horseback performed mock battle for the entertainment of scores of spectators i believe him for it is an exceedingly spacious hall and sitting in the centre of it beneath a live palm tree under which a tentlike canopy had been erected is the solid gold throne of cairo and on that throne watching me with eyes as hard as chips of flint was hafiz the resplendent himself surrounded by ranks of servants aides scribes and court officials of various kinds most of them sitting on the polished marble floor on enormous tufted cushions the caliph of cairo was a much smaller man than i anticipated very brown and with the aspect of someone who has spent an active youth beneath the scorching sun of the desert his skin was deeply creased like wellused leather and his hair was thick and entirely grey like many holy men his beard was long and woven into two braids which were drawn up into his turban somehow and aside from his turban which was purest white and glistening like sunlight on fresh snow and bore an enormous bloodred ruby surrounded by the turquoise tips of peacock feathers affixed in gold over his brow the caliph dressed in the manner of a simple tradesman or farmer his clothes were spotless and finely made but of humble hardwearing cloth he sat on a broad cushion upon his throne with his legs crossed beneath him as if he were in a tent in a wilderness camp he frowned when he saw me and i knew my sentence was sealed still i bowed low as wazim presented me and by way of greeting i spoke the few words of arabic which he had taught me most excellent and exalted khalifa i said may the one god who created all men preserve you forever i am deeply honoured to meet my lord and master whose kindness and generosity have so long sustained me although the words were wazims i meant what i said i was grateful for my benign captivity under his roof i knew how easily it could have been otherwise the great mans frown deepened further but with consternation he made no reply but sat pulling on his long grey moustache and watching me narrowly as you are an educated man he replied in good latin let us speak directly i was much heartened by this to be sure any time an arab be he saracen seljuq danishman or egyptiandeigns to speak to you in your own tongue number yourself among the few and fortunate still i did not allow my elation to show in my manner or my speech which would have been disrespectful as you will lord i replied evenly he regarded me for a time and then said you have been sent to me by the khalifa of baghdad that is true my lord no doubt he imagined i would be a useful addition to your illustrious court alhafiz grunted at my small attempt at humour what is your name i am lord duncan of caithness in scotland i am on pilgrimage my lord and was sojourning in anazarbus when it was attacked by amir ghazi i was captured and taken prisoner by the seljuqs khalifa almutarshid says that you are a spy and a traitor to islam he has condemned you to death then with a dismissive wave of his hand he added i see no reason to alter his judgement addressing the guards he said this one is to be executed at once take him away as the guards stepped forwards and grasped me by the arms alhafiz demanded have you nothing to say placing myself firmly in the palm of the swift sure hand i replied no my lord all is as the great king decrees the guards seized me turned me around and led me from the hall wazim padding along behind distraught muttered platitudes of comfort under his breath i paid him no heed for i was gathering my courage to face the headsmans axe we reached the great ebony doors and halted while they were opened by two bluerobed porters from the throne behind us the caliph called infidel who did you mean the guards halted and i was hauled around to face the caliph my lord lifting his hand from his lap he motioned the guards to bring me before him once more you spoke of the great king just now who did you mean i meant the lord god ruler of heaven and earth shaper of destiny architect of the ages and champion of the faithful these last were titles the muhammedans used for the almighty and which any christian could also espouse in all good faith the caliphs dark eyes grew narrowwhether with anger or distrust i could not tell there is but one god he declared thrusting a long finger into the air above his head allah is one that is so my lord i said bowing my head in reverence there is no god but god alone the frown reappeared upon his dark wrinkled face what do you know of such things very little my lord i am but a simple pilgrim so you have said he snapped but not so simple as you make out i think frowning furiously he leaned forward chin in hand and glared as if trying to decide what to do with me finally he said do you deny you are a christian no lord i answered i am a christian with your permission i would merely point out that i have nothing to do with either rome or byzantium neither pope nor emperor hold authority over me this surprised him and strangely his surprise gratified him it was as if he had suspected something curious about me and now his suspicion was rewarded the frown vanished instantly and he regarded me with an expression of wary interest so you too are an armenian we know of these christians i beg your pardon most excellent khalifa i replied but neither am i an armenian not an armenian he said what are you then christian tell me quickly my lord khalifa i am of the cele de i replied we are an obscure sectonce plentiful but now vastly diminished in numbers where once we ruled the whole of britain we are now confined to a small realm in the far north for some reason this appeared to please him immensely i have heard of this pritania he replied it is very far away from rome and byzantium you say yes my lord as far as east from west with three seas between the caliph squirmed on his cushion impatiently since you are a christian of particular devotion he said i will grant you a day to make peace with your god before i send you to meet him in judgement i thank you my lord i replied bowing in acknowledgement of his generosity he gestured to the guards once more and i was taken from the hall and returned to my rooms where i now sit and write in contemplation of what has happened although i am grateful for even this small reprieve i cannot think what it might betoken still i have this day dare i hope for more i pray the hand of the executioner may spare me yet a little longer for your sake cait while i wait i can think of nothing better than to proceed with my tale this i will do even now marseilles is a rowdy river town heaving with rough industry there are no fewer than five ship yardsall of them clattering to wake the dead from the crack of dawn to after sunset half the town and countryside is kept busy serving the shipbuilders and the other half earns its crust supplying the wharf and harbour with goods and commodities of one kind or another the harbour is wellprotected wide and deep and there we found the last of the templar ships making ready to set sail the larger part of the fleet had already departed there were fortytwo ships in allbut eighteen remained in port taking on supplies which had not been ready in time i instructed sarn to put in close to the templar ships and then padraig and i hurried to find the soldier we had spoken to in rouen pax vobiscum i said approaching the first warrior monk we saw god be good to you my friend we are looking for one of your brothers i explained that we had been instructed to meet a member of his order in this very place he asked who we were looking for and i told him it was de bracineaux the man asked looking us up and down renaud de bracineaux are you certain if it was renaud then you are fortunate indeed he was to have departed with the first ships but has been detained he is still here he told us that renaud was a commander of the order and that all the commanders were holding council with the grand master over concerns which had arisen while sojourning in the country his return is expected as soon as the council is finished tomorrow perhaps or the next day and then we will sail for outremer i thanked the brother for his help and we made our way back to the boat to wait roupen had determined to see if he could beg passage from any ship sailing east now that he was destitute he could not afford to pay his way as he had originally planned and the thought of humbling himself that way cast him into a sour and miserable moodnor was that all although he said nothing against them anyone could easily discern that he held no fondness for the templars i mentioned it to padraig who had also noticed how the young lord either grimaced or fidgeted every time the warrior monks were mentioned sarn too was unhappy now that we had reached our destination he knew he would be sent home and he wanted to continue with us to jerusalem this i could not allow nor considering the rigours of the journey could i in good conscience send him home by himself the solution to this quandary remained beyond our grasp the rest of the dayalthough not for lack of discussion sarn could not understand why having come this far he should not be permitted to continue the rest of the way you will need strong servants in the holy land he kept saying to which i would reply my father needs strong servants back in scotland what is more he needs his boat you would send me back alone he countered with sullen reproach believe me i wish i had a better choice but it cannot be helped you must go home as we agreed next morning a young templar came to our mooring and informed us that renaud de bracineaux had been apprised of our request and was waiting to see us taking up the box containing bezus knives padraig and i followed the youth to the long double rank of templar vessels where we were conducted up the boarding plank and onto the deck of the largest ship i had ever set foot upon in all my life renaud was standing by the mast directing the loading of supplies which were heaped in a small mountain upon the thick deck of the sturdy vessel he turned as the young man came before him announcing our presence and said here now you have found me at last it is good to see you my friends he put his hands on our shoulders and said are you ready to swear the oath and join our order nothing would please me more i told him as i have said however i am foresworn and cannot undertake another oath he accepted this with good grace i am sorry to hear it yet even knowing this you have come why we are on pilgrimage to the holy land i said indicating padraig and we had hoped to beg passage aboard one of your ships i see he nodded his enthusiasm fading i might have guessed unfortunately i fear i must disappoint you we have room aboard our ships only for fellow templars and those who have official business with the order he offered us a sad smile alas it appears you have travelled a very long way for nothing i am sorry he turned away from us saying now you must excuse me as you can see we are getting ready to sail i am needed elsewhere disheartened i stood for a moment thinking what to do padraig held out the box to me you have been most kind i told the templar commander we will not detain you any longeronly i am reminded that we have something which belongs to you that i heartily doubt he replied already moving away balthazar of aries sent it i said raising my voice slightly he turned and looked back at me the armourer he considered for a moment the same i continued you should remember him you purchased a cargo of weapons from him we did he allowed warily but i cannot see how this could possibly concern you i explained quickly how upon completion of our visit with the armourer he had given us a box containing six goldhandled daggers i opened the box to display the knives they were not ready when you came to collect your purchase and he asked us to deliver them to you i passed the box to him we have done what we agreed to do and now we will leave you in peace the frown reappeared on the templars face turning he called to one of his brother knights across the ship the man joined him and the two held close conversation for a moment then de bracineaux said it is true that the knives were missing from the cargo i owe you my thanks for delivering them and will pay you for your trouble for i also am an honest man bezu has already done that i told him you owe us nothing the templar nodded regarding padraig and me with as i thought an expression of regret are you certain we cannot tempt you to join our ranks i would feel disposed to consider it i said if you could provide passage for three pilgrims bound for the holy land three asked de bracineaux you multiply like weasels sir a moment ago there were but two we have another with us i said and told him about the young lord roupen a nobleman of armenia at the name his interest reawakened with wonderful swiftness i know only one noble family in armenia he said that of prince leo could it be the same family one and the same i replied i have undertaken to aid his return to the holy land by all means you must come with us de bracineaux said making up his mind at once we have room aboard this ship for such as yourselves and you will be made welcome and enjoy every comfort we can provide make whatever preparations you require we sail tomorrow at dawn i thanked the templar whereupon padraig and i hurried back along the quay to where sarn and roupen were waiting as we walked along i caught padraig watching me with a sour expression on his faceas if he had swallowed a bolt of vinegar what i demanded stopping in my tracks whatever in the world is wrong now you told the templar you were foresworn he said and could not undertake the templar vow yes i agreed so i know of no such vow you think i lied to him is that it did you no the vow was my own he folded his long arms across his chest and regarded me suspiciously as i am your companion through all things i think i should know this vow you have taken i started walking again it does not concern you duncan he said sharply the gentle priest so rarely raises his voice i forget he can be quite stubborn when he chooses everything about this pilgrimage concerns me i will hear this vow you have made and i will tell youbut in my own time i replied over my shoulder and kept walking so i would not have to speak to him further we quickly rejoined sarn and roupen who were waiting to hear how we had fared with the templars roupen was less than overjoyed he grumbled his thanks and went off to see if he could discover any word of his home from the sailors and merchantmen on the wharf sarn too grew petulant and quiet he stared at me balefully but said nothing meanwhile padraig and i busied ourselves searching for suitable companions to accompany sarn back to britain our search was concluded when padraig discovered a fellow pilgrim named robert tookes who having been sorely wounded in the holy land by a seljuq bandits arrow was returning home to britain with his aged father the two of them had arrived in marseilles three days earlier with a venetian merchant ship from jaffa and were now seeking passage to england padraig found them at the small chapel which served the wharf and harbour he had stopped by to pray at midday and had passed them as he was leaving he heard them speaking to one another and recognizing their speech had paused to inquire where they were bound upon learning their destination he brought them to the boat although sarn did his best to discourage them by glaring and frowning as if he were being asked to sail off the edge of the world with the devil and his brother for passengers the men were courteous and welldisposed and we quickly struck a bargain they would pay for all necessary supplies and sarn would take them to inbhir ness where they would easily find a boat going south upon concluding this arrangement robert tookes seized me by the hand in friendship we are both very grateful to you my father and i he told me have no worry for your man or your boat as god is my witness we will see him safely home we arranged for them to return at first light with their belongings and they hurried away to secure provisions and prepare for the voyage ahead all was falling into place at last and i foresaw only clear and pleasant sailing ahead feeling pleased with myself i settled back and enjoyed a welldeserved nap despite sams disgruntled huffing and clumping around seventeen roupen returned a little after sunset and we ate our evening meal no one in this flyblown swamp has even heard of anazarbus he complained disappointed at not discovering any news of his home sitting beside the doleful sarn the two of them presented a uniformly dismal appearance which padraig and i did our best to ignore we talked idly of this and that as night slowly deepened around us the harbour grew quiet and we watched the swallows skim the water as the new moon rose in the eastern sky i was lying back and thinking what a fine night it was for stargazing when padraig turned to me and said i think a prayer before we sleep would see us in good stead for the journey tomorrow he stood come the chapel is not far we can say our prayers here just as well i pointed out reluctant to leave the peaceful harbour the chapel would be better replied the stubborn monk climbing quickly from the boat you come too roupen i rose slowly and followed roupen declined saying he would stay with sarn and help watch the boat i caught up with the longlegged priest as he started across the allbutdeserted square which fronted the wharf you will like the chapel duncan he said as i fell into step beside him it has a very unusual carving he led me to a small square building made of stone a dull glimmer of light shone in the two tiny windows either side of an arched wooden door an iron latch secured the door but it lifted easily and padraig pushed open the door two large candles burned either side of a simple wooden altar above which hung the carving padraig had mentioned the candles were poorly made and gave off black smoke which stank of burning hair the foul light did little to dispel the gloom but as the room was empty we stepped up to the altar for a closer look at the carving a mother with an infant child cradled in her arms a halo of gold surrounded the heads of both mother and the holy child whose figures had been carved from a large piece of very dark wood aside from that it was something one might have seen in any latin church what do you notice asked padraig the wood carver employed some considerable skill beyond that i find nothing unusual about it they are black said padraig well the wood is black i allowed no he said look more closely i did as he directed and put my face near the carving as i had said the figures were finely rendered the child was reaching a tiny hand up towards the mothers solemn face as she gazed with maternal gravity upon the world that would one day revile and crucify her son aside from the sombre almost doleful expression on the mothers face i saw nothing at all to remark upon is there some mystery here that i am supposed to see i asked they are black padraig repeated yes we have established that they are black not because the wood is black it is not they were painted black i looked again more closely and realized he was right there were places near the base where scratches in the paint work revealed the lighter colour of the wood beneath how strange i remarked touching the coloured wood lightly with my finger why would anyone want to paint them black is it that they think the mother of jesu was an ethiope she is called the black madonna announced a voice from the doorway roupen had thought better of his decision and joined us after all he came to the altar and indicating the mother figure said mary she is but not the mother of jesu then who is she i wondered mary the magdalene but that is ridiculous why should the magdalene be cradling the infant christ it makes no sense indeed the monk smiled shrewdly unless it is not the infant christ she is holding i waited for one of them to tell me who the infant figure represented well am i the only one in all of frankland who does not know who the infant is supposed to represent it is jesus son said roupen his answer so amazed me that it took me a moment to work out all the implications of this extraordinary revelation christs son i exclaimed aloud staring at the tiny carved figure but that is horrendous placing a finger to his lips to quiet me padraig merely nodded there are those who believe that jesu and mary were husband and wife after all the scripture speaks often of the disciple jesu loved most scholars assume the appellation betokens john the apostle but there is no reason why it might not designate another besides added roupen it is well known that many women followed jesu and supported his earthly ministry in various waysthis too is well attested in holy scripture but see here now i protested christs son think what you are saying as to that the monk replied in the same calm equivocal tone it was commonplace for a jewish rabbi to be married in fact it would have been remarkable if not improbable if it had been otherwise if as the church that bears his name believes our lord and redeemer was subject to the same humanity we all possess then why should marriage remain beyond christs experience the union of husband and wife is an essential part of gods design for the human family after all should not the author of our faith adhere to the same rigours that are imposed upon his followers the magdalene was a prostitute and a demoniac i protested would you have me believe that our beloved lord was one flesh with a demonridden whore again you speak only hearsay and slanderous supposition nowhere in the scripture is it written she was a whore only that demons were driven from her and she was healed in all likelihood the designation of prostitute came very much later when it became let us say inconvenient for the pope to recognize the rank and position of a powerful and influential woman lifting a hand to the carving he said however it was those who hold to this cult believe the union of jesu and mary produced a child after christ was crucified and the persecution of the new faith began in jerusalem the holy family fledfirst to damascus and then to rome eventually however they settled here in marseilles i wondered this grows more fantastic with every word indeed agreed roupen i have never heard that part of the tale it was called marsalla then padraig explained a wellknown roman port grain and cattle were shipped from here to the east and the trade in those days was very good it was a fine and prosperous city and far away from the religious intrigues and oppressions of the east the holy family and their train of followers brought the new faith with them and they have been revered in this region ever since as you can see he answered with such assurance i could not help asking how can you possibly know all this padraig smiled the cult of the black madonna is well known to the cele de it is heresy of course although mild compared to most still it is heresy nonetheless we came to know of it when it was once laid on the head of beloved pelagius our great teacher and advocate he defended himself mightily against the charge answering his accusers in a bold treatise which is preserved and studied by the keepers of the holy light padraig led us briefly in our prayers and we finished a short while later roupen went on ahead leaving padraig and me to our talk you knew the black madonna was there i said was that why you brought me he shook his head i had no idea it was there until i saw it today when i came in to pray he dismissed the carving saying it is of no accounta curiosity nothing more then why i wanted to remind you that things are not always as they seem he replied and that even the most forthright appearances often hide a deeper meaning for those who know how to look even in the dim and flickering candlelight i could see his gaze grow keen and knew there would be no evading him any longer i brought you here so that you could tell me the true purpose of your pilgrimage i should not have been surprised butas i have said and will say againthe priests of the cele de are ever full of surprises i suppose he had worked it out following our brief exchange earlier in the day although i would have preferred telling him when we were somewhat closer to our destination i knew there would be no putting him off now so i said very well it seems this is the night for sharing hidden purposes padraig smiled knowingly it is that it is easily told i began as we left the chapel and not half so mysterious as the black madonna first i must ask you whether you have ever heard of the iron lance of course he did not laugh outright but my question amused him it is the spear of christs crucifixion it is that i affirmed and since it seems the priests of the cele de know everything you probably also know that the sacred object resides in my fathers treasure room now that you bring it up i seem to recall hearing about that yes have you always known i asked feeling like a fool for ever thinking i might hide anything from him i stopped walking to look at his reaction no he replied indeed i learned of it only a day or so before we left abbot emlyn told you i suppose he did confirmed padraig but my uncle asked me never to speak of it to anyoneunless like now someone else should speak of it first have you seen the sacred lance alas no one day perhapswho knows well i told him resuming our ramble i have seen it and held it in my hands it was the night my father told me how he had rescued it from the heathen and from the hands of the iniquitous crusaders who would have made of it a sacrilege that same night i vowed within myself that even as my father had rescued the lance i would rescue the cross the true cross mused padraig i could not tell whether he approved of my plan or not torfeinar told me all about the shameful desecration of that holy treasure before he died i said you were there you heard how they cut the cross of our redemption into pieceswith as little thought as i might chop a kindling stick i was there yes i heard he took a slow deliberate step away and then turned to face me and this is why you could not swear the oath of the templars i did not think it would be right since i cannot say where or how i shall obtain the pieces of the holy relic i must remain unencumbered in my search i can see that and you approve he did not answer instead he asked what will you do with the crossif by some miracle you should obtain it i will bring it back to caithness and place it in my fathers treasure room alongside the sacred lance i see he was quiet for a time gazing up into the nightdark sky as if in search of an answer written in the stars your plan he said at last lacks nothing in audacity and what it wants in feasibility it more than makes up in ambition but do you approve in truth i do not he declared firmly if this is why you have undertaken pilgrimage to the holy land leaving all you love and hold dearestthen i must tell you as a priest and friend that i do not approve in the least deep down in my bones i suppose i had feared he would say something like thiswhich is why i had kept it from him i knew he would not like my plan but i needed his help the wily priest grinned suddenly and spread his hands the lord moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform he said and contrary to what you apparently believe he does not often seek my blessing before he acts is this your way of saying you think it is a good idea anyway no it is a terrible idea padraig assured me even so it may also be inspired please your assurance is breathtaking i replied have you not heard wondered padraig the good lord often uses foolishness to humble the wise if this idea of yours is of god then the combined might of all the nations on earth cannot stand against it i accepted his judgement and we walked silently along the darkened street for a time as we came onto the quayside i asked you did not tell me padraig why is the magdalene painted black that i cannot say it has been suggested that it was the colour of her cloak when she came to these shores and that is how she was known to the people the black mary others say it is to distinguish her from the mother of jesu since they are so often confused one for the other he paused thoughtfully then said wise pelagius said that it was to hide a secret which those who revere the black mary hold sacred and guard to the death what is this secret i wondered aloud no one outside the cult knows said the monk and those inside will never tell eighteen the templars were ready to sail by the time padraig roupen and i joined the ship the next morning i wanted to see sarn safely away before leaving and although his passengers the tookes were ready we had to wait for the provisions to be delivered the merchants appeared just after daybreak and we quickly loaded the boat and bade the three returning travellers farewell take care sarn i called pushing the boat from the wharf give all at home a full and fair account ask them to pray for our safe return we watched until they were under sail and then the three of us hurried to board the templar ship we were greeted courteously on our arrival and shortly after climbing onto the deck the order was given to cast off we stood at the rail and watched the city of marseilles pass slowly from view as the ship moved out into the bay once in deeper water the helmsman turned the ship and headed southwest along the coast and we settled ourselves aboard our new vessel i will now describe a templar ship for they are very unlike the sort of craft seen in northern waters broad of beam and highsided they possess several decks one above another and a single mast of gigantic proportions these vessels ride tall in the water and tend to bob awkwardly in the least swell they are unsteady and woefully difficult to manoeuvre much i imagine like steering a hogshead barrel in a flood indeed for this reason sailors even call them round ships for all they are ungainly and largely unsuitable for any purpose save the one for which they were made the transportation of men and animals across the mild sea of middle earth god forbid that they should ever be caught in one of the storms which scourge the northern isles throughout the winter i have no doubt the precarious craft would sink like an anvil at first squall be that as it may the venetians own many of these ships and the genoans and others too our vessel was owned by a merchant from otranto whose son a plump sweetnatured man named dominicserved as captain we were introduced to him shortly after marseilles disappeared from view he invited us to break bread with him in his apartment you see gait how very large these ships can be there are rooms beneath the uppermost deck some of them large as chambers in a lordly hall and this is what the captain hada chamber with a box bed and a long table with room enough for six men on benches either side thus renaud padraig and i and roupen as well as other highranking templars were invited to dine with the captain that first night roupen excused himself saying his stomach was unsettled for all i know that may have been the truth and not an excuse to avoid joining the rest of us however i think it more likely that he had no stomach for the templars never mind the food padraig and i eagerly accepted the invitation and if that meal was in any way typical i quickly discovered how our captain maintained his rotund form despite his long sea journeys of meat and sweet breads and other fancies there was no stint roast fowl and smoked pork beef and fish of several kinds and flat bread made with the oil of oliveswhich sicilians especially esteemand small barley loaves made with honey wine was drunk throughout the mealfor the noblemen of taranto dearly love their wine and think nothing of serving it and drinking it by the tun hoping to keep our wits about us padraig and i attempted to dine with some circumspection as did commander renaud everyone else however behaved as if our supper was a festal meal following a long privation i was appalled at the amount of food and drink which my fellow diners consumed shoving bread and meat down their gullets in uncouth chunks and gobbets oblivious to any restraint they guzzled wine until it ran down their beards in crimson streams and pooled about their elbows which they planted on the table and never removed my embarrassment for them went unheeded however as they blithely ate and drank their way through enough provisions to sustain a dozen farm labourers for a month dominic of otranto beamed at his guests and bade his servingboys to keep the wine flagons charged and the cups overflowing as a consequence the talk was lively and free and i learned many things of life in outremer which were to prove useful in the days to come for when they learned that padraig and i had never been to jerusalem or antioch or even constantinople they eagerly took it upon themselves to educate us in the manner of life we should encounternot that they were in any way agreed upon the particulars still i learned that the weather was hot and dry and that the land was infested with all manner of biting flies and stinging plants which made life a constant misery rivers mostly dried up during the summer and no rain fell from spring until winter when the fierce wind came to scour the land from top to bottom and fill every dwelling place with gritty dust the people they said were poor for the most part barely scratching a living out of the rocky unproductive soilexcept in the rare river valleys where the streams were sustained by springs hi the mountains then the resulting cultivation was a very paradise bringing forth fruits and vegetables of every kind in almost unimaginable bounty for the most part however the language was incomprehensible the food unpalatable and the water undrinkable a more barren land there never was to be sure if not for the fact that the lord high god himself had chosen the place for his own peculiar reasons surely no one would give it so much as a moments heed as for the people the women were dried up hags and crones whose unlovely hides were wrinkled as grapes left too long in the sun the men were sulky sly and vengeful skilled in imagining slights and capable of maintaining heated feuds into the sixth generation what is more young or old they were cunning in all the ways of malice iniquity and greed the arabs are very devils sir one man declared lies and blasphemies are all they know beware they are born thieves agreed another they will steal anything that is not chained down and stab you the moment your back is turned turk or saracen they are all alike added the first the greeks too are to be trusted only so far as you can spit but the greeks are christians padraig pointed out innocently and therefore allies and fellow soldiers this brought peals of laughter from those gathered around the board if you believe that roared the foremost blackbearded templar then you will wake one night with your throat slit and your balls in your mouth i considered such talk beneath reproach and made no reply but my fellow trenchermen followed one vulgarity with another until i felt justified in remarking on their lack of common decency life in the holy land must be greatly altered indeed i observed if such low profanity is cause for mirth rather than shame i fully expected to be reviled for my words i braced myself as blackbeards lips drew back in an ugly sneer but even as he drew breath to decry me renaud glanced up sharply our friends are right to remind us of our manners brothers he said glaring down along the board as if defying anyone to disagree with him we will each ask forgiveness in our prayers tonight and examine our hearts in all penitence this quieted the raucous table and the meal ended in a much more subdued if not respectful manner afterward renaud sought me out on deck where padraig and i were taking the soft evening air the commander presented himself with a respectful bow and said allow me to offer you both apologies for my brother monks impious behaviour we are not the ones to receive your apologies i replied it was not our table you owe us nothing nevertheless the templar said you were the ones who called us back to our better selvesand were right to do so my men have been absent from the stringency of the monastery too long and have allowed themselves to grow irreverent i know what fighting men are like i told him do not think you must explain anything to me he smiled stiffly even so please accept my sincere apology for our regrettable lapse god willing it will not happen again we began to walk along the rail then he and i padraig padded along unobtrusively behind us listening but keeping his thoughts to himself we came to the stern where some of the sailors were talking and joking among themselves when we had passed them and could not be overheard renaud said i am interested to know how you came to be in the company of prince leos son we met him in rouen i explained where he was searching for passage home i told about how the young lord had survived the illness that had carried off all his travelling party and left him stranded in a strange land with no one to help him do you know anything of his family i know his father is a prince in his own country but nothing more than that i answered something in the templars tone made me wish to defend the young man whether his people were nobles of the highest rank or the lowliest of slaves made not the slightest difference to me roupen needed passage home and we needed someone to guide us to marseilles we struck a bargain which was beneficial to both our interests and he has proven himself a faithful friend renaud raised his eyebrows at this are you always so trusting until a man shows me otherwise i said bristling slightly at the implication of his question i give him my best regard it is never a mistake to treat someone as you would wish to be treated if you were in his boots no he allowed quickly of course not again forgive me i meant no offence i merely wished to determine what you knew of the circumstances surrounding your young friends family as i have said i know very little of roupens family or their circumstances is there something i should know the templar pursed his lips thoughtfully only this he said at last your friends father prince leo is an unhappy man in a dangerous position i fear he is not to be trusted i am sorry to hear it i replied uncertainly i could not discern what he intended by telling me this as if in reply to my hesitance renaud continued believe me it gives me no pleasure to say it i have every sympathy for your friend roupen his situation is grave indeed looking out over the water to the darkening shorelineas if gazing at an open and oozing woundhe added mostly to himself bohemonds reach does often exceed his grasp mention of the audacious prince brought to mind my fathers dealings and i said what you say interests me greatly my father knew prince bohemond they met in jaffa during the great pilgrimage and my father helped lord bohemond secure the aid of the emperor truly replied the templar commander his curiosity instantly piqued oh yes i assured him and the prince returned the favour if not for bohemonds help my father might never have returned home many did not agreed the templar commander his interest visibly quickened there was sharp appraisal in his glance as he said but you misunderstand me i was speaking of young bohemond the son of the illustrious prince not that it matters overmuch for the son is that much like his father unfortunately he shares his fathers insatiable appetites as well he went on to explain that bohemond ii son of prince bohemond of taranto had at last come of age and returned to the holy land to claim his inheritance not content to receive the county of antioch in its present condition he had determined to restore its boundaries to their furthest extent since coming to the holy land four years ago renaud said the young count has waged several successful campaigns and recovered a goodly portion of the land lost since his father had ruled there he is a restless youth and a formidable fighter de bracineaux regarded me meaningfully he will not rest until he has won back everything and this is where the trouble arises i surmised precisely the templar agreed the northern part of the county now belongs to the armenian principality at the time young bohemonds father took it there was no one to oppose him the land had been under seljuq domination for many years and the armenian princes had their hands full defending the little that remained to them it was easy to guess what had happened as the templar continued the tale i could almost see the events as movements of the pieces on a game board once the turks had been driven out roupens people immediately reasserted their ownership expecting no doubt that fellow christians would uphold their rightful claims in this they had been disappointed however their demands for redress were scorned and their cries for justice unheeded until disaster befell the overreaching count of antioch bohemond ran afoul of emperor alexius in the end and his monstrous ambition was curtailed after a disastrous battle with the greeks the great prince was forced to relinquish the disputed lands which were ceded to the armenian rulers thus with the emperors help the armenian princes had managed to claw back their traditional territory but the peace of these last years will not continue renaud announced bleakly young bohemond ii is as wilful and stubborn as his father i fear there will be bloodshed between these two houses very soon he seemed to expect some answer but i could not imagine why he should be confiding in me and knew not what to tell him your candour is both welcome and refreshing i said but i would be leading you astray if i permitted you to think i possessed any power in these matters of course the knight allowed i understand i merely thought you might derive some benefit from this information in light of your friendship with lord roupen that is naturally if you were to find yourself in a position to influence the young lords opinion you would remember your duty as a christian this confused me somewhat i knew full well the templar was asking me to intervene for him in some way but i could not understand what he expected me to do please i told him speak plainly i am unused to the plots and intrigues of the east if you have a concern tell me outright i assure you i will give it my fullest consideration renaud nodded and folded his hands behind his back as commander of the antioch order of the knights templar i am charged by his holiness pope honorius with keeping the peace not only in the city but throughout the countryside as well in addition i am pledged to support the ruler of the county by whose sufferance we are granted our charter he looked at me meaningfully i can put it no more plainly than that at last i began to see the shape of his dilemma to uphold the peace he would have to break faith with bohemondan action which would result in the revocation of his charter and the expulsion of the templars from antioch although i accepted his assessment of the situationi had no reason to believe otherwisei could not help wondering aloud why do you tell me these things i am merely a pilgrim on his way to the holy land this is a matter for the rulers involved and would it seems to me be better served by a royal council renauds smile turned bitter you are right of course i will not trouble you further he made to walk away i caught him by the arm and held him speak what is on your mind man where is the harm glancing at padraig his mouth drew tight i have said all i care to say then go your way i replied releasing him for if you hold the honour and counsel of a priest of the cele de in such low esteem you deserve all the anguish your silence brings indicating padraig i said this man is my friend and advisor my anam cara the true friend of my soul he shares my innermost thoughts and is my lifes companion and guide speak to me or hold your tongue that is your choice but know that any remedy you seek through me will be discussed with my wise counsellor renaud nodded curtly he was not used to being addressed in this way and did not like it but was man enough to see the sense he did not dismiss me or turn me aside harshly but swallowed his pride once more forgive me priest he said bending in a small but genuine bow of humility i meant no disrespect padraig inclined his head in acceptance and pardon i forgive you freely if it would help you to unburden your soul i will walk a little apart so that the two of you may speak more easily together no said the templar making up his mind that is not necessary i have come this far let us see the thing to its conclusion he turned and began walking once more his hands clasped firmly behind him his eyes downcast as it was growing dark now one of the sailors came forwards to light the torches in the iron sconces at the prow and at the base of the mast we strolled the deck in silence until we were alone once more what i am about to say would be considered treason against my liege lord if it were to reach his ears renaud declared i heard the solid weight of his voice and knew he was speaking the dark heart of his fear i sought to reassure him i give you my word your confidence will not be betrayed all this summer prince bohemond has been recruiting men from his former lands in sicily the commander told us he is using ships leased to the templars to transport them to antioch i could not think this information treasonous and told the worried knight as much no he replied that much could easily be discerned by one and all what cannot be perceived is that the bold prince plans a surprise attack on anazarbus before the summers end he stopped and turned to me there he said grimly now you have it i have entrusted you with knowledge which could defeat my lord on the battlefield and bring about the ruin of antioch such is the power i bestow use it wisely i could feel my very soul shrinking from the terrible responsibility his words had placed upon my unsuspecting shoulders the templar gazed at me his eyes watchful in the soft glow of the torches you spoke of plots and intrigues just now let me give you a word of advice sooner trust an enemy than a friend strange advice yes the templar allowed and the difficulty you will find is learning to tell the difference between them nineteen thus from the very first day aboard ship i was plunged into the labyrinthine schemes of the intriguebreeding east and i had not yet set foot in the holy land over the next many days i stewed and fretted over every word spoken to me that night the knowledge festered in me poisoning my days and nights with dread and the dull apprehension that whatever i did would damn me for to save one realm would be to ruin another why had the templar confided in me was it to claim me as an ally and thus remove me from the young lords side or did he wish to use my friendship with roupen in some way he had hinted as much but i was at a loss to know what i might do try as i might i could think of no way in which i might serve the common good what purpose would it achieve anyway there was nothing the young lord could do about the planned attack just now and the knowledge would only bring him misery and pain moreover he might consider himself to be among enemies and do something precipitous by holding my tongue i spared him that at leastalthough it was at considerable cost to myself it was not until we reached cyprus that i had the opportunity to speak in complete freedom with padraig about the delicate information the templar commander had confided what are we to do padraig i demanded all the woe rising in a black flood of dread what are we to do we had availed ourselves of the opportunity to walk through the pleasant port and market town of limasol while the ships took on fresh water and supplies you know as well as i that we cannot just stand by and do nothing have i said we should do nothing what then before he could answer i said just remember that hundreds perhaps thousands of lives are at risk whatever we do not to mention padraig held up his hands peace brother leave off your pissing and moaning a moment and let me speak speak then as it happens he began you are not the only one to have struggled with this problem i also have bethought myself what can be done yes yes get on with it man very well it comes to this we must seek out prince bohemond at first opportunity and demand that he repent of his decision to attack the armenians i stared at the priest with envy at his sublime innocence you are a wonder i told him even knowing what you know of princes and their insatiable appetites for wealth and power you still suggest this tell me what do you think will happen i expect god will move in bohemonds heart and the young prince will recognize his error and turn aside before it is too late your faith is remarkable priest i told him if you believe the prince will even listen to a single word you say let alone heed your counsel that will be his decision padraig replied our way remains clear we must do what god would have us do i glared at the monk and knew he meant just what he said we would have to go before this prince bohemond and deliver the judgement turn aside from your wicked ways o mighty ruler repent and seek forgiveness or suffer divine retribution for your sins yes and i could just about imagine the reception our call to repentance would receive he will have us flayed alive for our impertinence and our heads adorning pikes above the city gates i grumbled that is what will happen perhaps granted padraig with a shrug we cannot refuse what is right and just merely because it may prove painful to us it will be more than painful i countered be assured of that but supposingmerely for the sake of our discussionthat we escape with our skins intact what then then if he will not embrace the peace of god we are free to take a warning to roupens people i stared at him and how did you come to that by reason of the fact that once we have declared our concerns before the prince his actions will be open for all men to judge he will repent or he will not if bohemond proceeds with his nefarious plan he does so in spite of our call to honour gods peace thus there will no longer remain any obstacle to a full and forthright profession of the princes intentions to any and all concerned i turned this over in my mind for a time it did seem the only way out of the dilemma renaud had forced upon us then it is agreed i decided we will make entreaty to the prince the moment we enter the city but allow me to put the case to bohemond i will appeal to his honour not his sin if de bracineaux is of the same mind in this matter and i believe he is for all his reasons may be his ownthen he will support us in our attempt if the three of us speak with one voice we may have some chance of escaping the full force of the princes displeasure well said concluded padraig however it falls out with the prince we must observe the utmost caution for if bohemond was to learn the son of his enemy was within his grasp he would seize the boy and hold him to ransom or worse roupen will have to be told what we intend his life will be at risk the moment we set foot in antioch we cannot keep him in ignorance any longer the next day when the ships departed on the last leg of the journey to outremer we summoned the young lord onto the top deck where we strolled along the rail and watched the rugged brown hills of cyprus dwindle into the wide blue distance when i was certain we would not be overheard by others going about their chores on deck i informed roupen of prince bohemonds plans to attack the armenian stronghold at anazarbus i thank you for telling me he said sinking into himself i know now that you are my true friends i will impose on you only so far as to see me safely off the ship once we make landfall at saint symeon i will leave the company and continue home on my own although he spoke with a firm resolve i could tell he was more than a little daunted by the prospect tjefore him he looked to padraig as he finished as if to plead the priests blessing on his plan your determination is understandable i suggested but there is another way come with us to antioch antioch he gasped go among my enemies i never will calm yourself and listen to me padraig and i plan to confront bohemond and demand that he turn away from his foolish i caught padraigs glance foolish and sinful plan to attack your people i have every confidence that commander de bracineaux will support us in this now then if bohemond listens to reason you will have no need to fear him and you can carry a good report home to your people and if he does not grumbled roupen dubiously then you will hasten home with a warning and we will help you i cannot speak for the templars but i believe we can count on their aid as well can we trust them he wondered we can i told him renaud knows who you are and has known since you first came on board this ship if he had intended ill for you we would certainly have seen evidence of it by now he is constrained by his priestly vows yet i believe he is trying to help you in the only way he can so we proceed to antiochand hide beneath prince bohemonds very nose roupen said little warming to the notion what then once we have spoken to bohemond we will know how things stand padraig said but understand whatever comes of this we will see you safely home needless to say our entrance into antioch a few days later was fraught and uncomfortable with the dread of discovery hanging over us as we passed through the enormous gates and along the palmlined streets of the great city how i wish it had been otherwise for truly antioch is a very marvel of a city rising from its rocky roots on the slow orontes river the splendid white walls soar upward to a height unequalled by any fortress i have ever seen magnificent in the golden sunrise the city glows like amber from the water gate at the rivers edge to the high citadel nested in the cradling rocks of the stronghold mound it is a sight to stir the heart with awe with our escort of templarstwo hundred strong on horseback their red emblems ablaze on white surcoats spears and helmets gleaming we descended the low hills and crossed the orontes valley to join the road leading to the city we passed over the bridge and in through the central gate entering the long wide treelined road which formed the citys main thoroughfare great houses of wealthy families lined the street along with ancient basilicas markets and churches large and small i knew the iron lance had been discovered in one of these selfsame churches and as we rode slowly along i kept turning my head this way and that in the forlorn hope that i might somehow see and recognize the place if i found it however i never learned for although i saw several churches none of them seemed in any way remarkable and i felt slightly disappointed nor did i have a chance to ask anyone about it for no sooner had we arrived at the garrison in the lower city but prince bohemond demanded audience of commander renaud the higherranking templars had been given quarters in the citadel itself and renaud having arrived in the city was evidently expected to go at once to join the prince i had confided to the commander my decision to bring a petition before the young prince at the soonest opportunity and he assentedalthough he stopped short of assuring me of his complete agreement to the plan when the templar commander turned from the princes messenger he said you are in luck my friend bohemond deigns to receive me i will take you and the priest along and we will have this out at once now i said and with the dust of the road clinging to us to avoid the sticky allembracing heat of the day we had risen just after midnight and crossed the rough hills before sunrise the dry days of summer had come when the suns rays strike the earth like the blast of an oven and the slightest footfall on the wellused roads raises a very pall of dust and clouds of biting flies the further inland we travelled the hotter and dustier it became with two hundred mounted templars the resulting clouds of grey grit made us appear as if we had spent days at the millstone grinding dry clods into powder the prince arrived in the city four days ago and is eager to begin planning his campaign the commander replied if we hope to dissuade him this will be our best chance he summoned his sergeant go now take a moment to wash and refresh yourselves he said gislebert will bring you to the palace when you are ready i will await you there the sergeant led us through a low door and out into a small courtyard surrounded by long ranks of old romanstyle barracks which were the templars quarters the yard was filled with soldiers welcoming their comrades and seeing them settled in their new surroundings gislebert brought us to a freshrunning fountain in the centre of the yard roupen grim and uneasy stood stifflegged glumly watching padraig and me as we splashed water on our faces from the stone basin i will go with you he said no i said that would not be prudent i cannot wait here alone what if someone tells bohemond i am here commander renaud has given his word i replied patiently you are safe in antioch so long as you remain in the garrison but you dare not show your face in the palace i am not afraid he announced carelessly i will go and speak to bohemond myself you may have opportunity to speak to the prince i told him but before we abandon our plan let us at least determine what manner of man this prince bohemond might be what am i to do while you are away he said unhappily kicking at the base of the fountain wait patiently padraig said and pray our appeal meets with sincere contrition and repentance and if it does not he snapped angrily he could not help himself nor could i blame him had i been in his place i would have behaved in much the same way we can cross but one bridge at a time i replied have faith padraig offered gently bind courage to your heart and seek the good lords guiding hand trust him and he will meet you in your need roupen accepted this with gloomy forbearance and said no more when we had finished washing and made ourselves as presentable as possible i turned to the young lord remain calm and do not stir from this place we will return as soon as possible i promised placing my hand on his shoulder god willing we shall bring you a good report with that we were led from the courtyard and following gislebert conducted along a dizzying array of narrow streets and stairways up into the heart of the old city to the high citadel and the palace where the count of antioch held court twenty bohemonds palace put me in mind of a noble lady fallen into beggary undoubtedly the royal residence had once been a very treasure but years of indifference and neglect had marred its best features costly wooden panels were gouged and scratched expensive silk rugs were worn threadbare their fine colours faded and dulled by dirt and indifferent use oncedazzling painted walls were dingy with the grime of smoke and oily food polished floors were rutted and dull from too many rough feet and too few washings several of the outer corridors contained filth from discarded slops and excrement which raised a nasty stink in the nose in all the place breathed an atmosphere of forlorn decline and dilapidation it made me sorry to see it sliding into decay and i felt myself resenting the thoughtless lord who could allow this to happen there are far worse things in this world as well i know but i glimpsed in the shabby surroundings a malignant disregard which i could not abide how much of this rot should be laid at the feet of the current inhabitant i could not tell but that the prince inhabited these oncesplendid halls and did nothing to relieve the distress so evident around him told me something of the man his appearance however all but dispelled the regrettable impression created by his surroundings for prince bohemond ii was a fullblooded handsome man broadshouldered longlimbed and tall with a firm jaw and open pleasant features his hair was long and fair and his beard short cut into the distinctive forked shape favoured by certain prankish noblemen his hands were big and strong and always movingas if restless when they did not clutch a sword together with commander renaud padraig and i were conducted into the princes private chamber by one of his advisors an old retainer from antioch who regarded us with the worldweary air of one who has seen too much the prince was standing over a long table on which a meal of roast fowl and plums had been spread he had a knife in one hand poised to strike and a gold cup in the other glancing up as the door opened to admit us he exclaimed de bracineaux you are here god be praised man it is good to see you they told me you had arrived and i could not believe my good fortune i did not expect you for another week forgetting his rank and place he leapt forwards to meet us stepping around the table in quick bounds he seized the templar by the arms and embraced him like a brother then seeing two strangers idling in renauds wake he cried and who is this with you come in sirs i give you good greeting join me all of you food has been prepared and i was just about to eat we would be delighted replied the templar turning to us he said may i present lord duncan of caithness and padraig his chaplain i am pleased to meet you gentlemen said the prince inclining his head nicely he smiled and despite myself i felt compelled to like him you cannot have been in the city long we have only just arrived i answered good voyage very good indeed my lord i said the mediterranean is smooth as a highway compared to the rough northern seas around scotland i have heard of this scotland you know prince bohemond said he turned away indicating that we should follow him to the table they say the men and women there are painted blue smiling he glanced at padraig and then at me but you are not painted blue are you no lord although the picti are known to daub themselves with woad when they do battle it is an old custom but still occasionally to be seen he smiled again showing neat white teeth i should like to see that he speared a roast fowl with his knife come my friends eat to his manservant he said hemar pour some wine for these thirsty fellows they have come all the way from scotland following the princes invitation we helped ourselves to the meat and fruit before us bohemond and renaud fell to talking about the voyage and the settling of the troops and i was glad to have the chance to observe the prince for a while he was i decided somewhat younger than he first appeared although his bearing and speech were that of an older more confident man i believe he adopted this manner to disguise the fact of his green immaturity he was little more than a child playing at a game for men and i felt strangely sorry for him as our hosts talked i considered how best to broach the subject of the princes plan to attack the armenians it would i considered be best for all of us if bohemond would raise the issue himself giving me a natural opportunity to speak but he seemed more than content to talk idly of travel and the weather and it occurred to me that perhaps the prince did not wish to say anything about his plans in front of padraig and me so it was left to us and if no one else touched on the matter soon i decided i would raise the issue myself i was steeling myself to do just that when young bohemond unable to restrain himself any longer tapped the table with the hilt of his knife here now de bracineaux we have beaten the bushes long enough i want to talk about the campaign how many men can i count on from you the templar commander lay aside his cup and composed himself to answer i have considered your request very carefully he answered to put the matter squarely i must tell you it places me in a very awkward position indeed wondered bohemond innocently i am distressed to hear it he did not appear dismayed in the least you see waging open warfare is outside the authority of the templar rule we are pledged to guard the roads and those who travel on them anything beyond that is a breach of our rules of order in short my lord attacking the forces of our christian allies would be reprehensible and unlawful bohemonds face tightened with vexation but he maintained his cheerful demeanour come now sir he cajoled you know other commanders have joined in battling the common enemy i am not asking you to do something your brothers would refuse what others do is a matter for their consciences for myself i cannot allow my men to be used as mercenaries the grand master has given me his assurance that there will be no difficulty the prince said somewhat petulantly and there will be noneso long as my men are not required to go against their priestly vows with all respect my lord prince we are defenders not aggressors do you deny that the protection of the borders of my realm is of utmost importance to the safety of pilgrims and citizens within this realm on the contrary replied renaud glad to find some area of agreement if the borders of this county should ever fall under enemy threat you will find the templars foremost in the fight i am glad to hear it answered bohemond quickly for a moment i had begun to doubt the wisdom of allowing the poor soldiers of christ to occupy such a large and i might add costly presence in this city after all a lord who cannot trust the courage of his warriors is already captive to his enemies never doubt the courage of the templars renaud said his voice tightening with suppressed anger our lives are forsworn before almighty god and we will fight to the death rather than dishonour the vow we have taken then why this unseemly hesitance demanded bohemond i tell you that so long as the borders of this county are held by armenians my people are not safe the air fairly bristled between them seeing that he had pressed the matter to an impasse with the templar commander bohemond turned his attention to padraig and me you must excuse us he said testily it seems the good commander and myself have opened a subject of disagreement this was my chance to intervene and i took it forgive me lord i am a stranger to this place and have no right to speak but if you would hear me out i would be much obliged if you have something sensible to say i welcome you sir sniffed the prince it would be an agreeable change to listening to the mealymouthed excuses of this craven commander renaud made to object but thought better of it and held his tongue bohemond was young and impetuous he was hotheaded and it was difficult to restrain his ambitious impulses antagonizing him would only make things worse although i am newly arrived in antioch my family is not without some experience of this part of the world my grandfather took the cross in the great pilgrimage and died in jerusalem moreover my father once held council with your fatherit was in jaffa if i remember aright and my father was about the same age as you are now my lord he came away from that meeting with a memory which my family has treasured ever since padraig frowned and gave me a warning look as if to tell me i was treading too close to our secret for his comfort my story pleased young bohemond immensely and i thought favourably disposed him to what i was about to say indeed sir he cried you see renaud not everyone in this godforsaken place is as ignorant of their christian duty as you are please continue therefore i said feeling my stomach knot into a hard ball i pray you will not think me reaching too far above my place when i suggest to you that commander renaud is right in refusing to support an attack on the armenians alas my words did not strike the young prince as i had hoped his face clenched and grew dark with anger how dare you he muttered he whirled on the templar giving vent to the full force of his anger you worm you put him up to this you sneaking coward get out of my sight everyone get out calm yourself my lord i said attempting to pacify him renaud is not to blame my views are my own and had i never set eyes on the good commander i would still say the same it is wrong to attack the armenians they are baptized christians fellow allies of the holy roman empire and hold to the same faith as you my lord they are filth roared bohemond his face contorted in hatred what is more they are scheming filth who have stolen my fathers land and iwill have it back he glared around at all of us angry and frustrated at finding his desires repudiated on all sides padraig rose and in the gentlest most gracious tone said in the name of god i urge you to remember your better self put aside your ignoble ambitions my lord repent of your plan and abandon your sinful scheme before alas padraig never finished his exhortation for the reckless prince picked up his knife from the table and flung it at the priests head shouting how dare you get out padraig barely dodged the blade which struck the wall and fell to the floor bohemond jumped up and shoved the table spilling cups and sending food rolling from the platters all of you get out leave me he screamed his pale face growing scarlet with rage as the furious prince reached for another knife commander renaud already on his feet moved towards me go he urged get back to the garrison and wait for me there we will stay and see it through leave us i will calm him and follow as soon as i can go turning quickly to the prince he said this is beneath you sir put down that knife and let us discuss this matter like reasonable men the prince still shouting and waving the knife was done with listening while he raged at the commander padraig and i made our way swiftly from the chamber and hurried back through the long low rooms of the palace descending by a number of dark and narrow stairways to the former stables below we passed quickly among the templars going about their chores and made for the first door and hurried out into the bright sunlit street once more we hesitated only long enough to locate the street by which we had come up to the citadel then hastened away again walking quickly but not runningnothing rouses citizens of a city as swiftly as the sight of a stranger in full flight every now and then i paused to look back and listen but neither saw nor heard anything to indicate pursuit of any kind we retraced our steps down the steeplyangled street to the lower city gradually easing our pace as we went the street grew more crowded with people making their way to and from the markets our exertions had made us wet with sweat and i was just thinking of stopping to rest a moment to collect our wits and cool off a little before continuing when padraig spied the garrison once safely behind the stout garrison walls we allowed ourselves to relax we crossed to the fountain in the yard and both of us refreshed ourselves with a good long drink before going in to a very distraught roupen awaiting word of our meeting we failed i told him bluntly bohemond would not listen to reason renaud stayed with the prince to try to calm him but i do not hold out any hope that he will change his mind the young lord nodded grimly thank you for trying he said softly i could see he was frightened and had allowed himself to place too much hope in our efforts we are not finished yet i told him trying to offer some small comfort when the commander returns we will sit down together and decide what to do alas if only it had been that simple twentyone we waited uneasily for commander de bracineaux to appear padraig and i found an opportunity to nap through the heat of the day taking it in turns to sit with roupen while the other slept lest he become fretful and overanxious the garrison now full of net arrivals remained busy with much coming and goingyet peaceful for all that the warrior monks maintained a cloistered calm amidst the general commotion of military life indeed the old roman garrison bore more than a passing resemblance to the monastery the quiet inner court with a chapel at one end the long ranks of barracks which might have been cells the kitchens always clattering with activity the refectory with its long banks of tables and benches and the templars themselves hurrying to and fro on their errands dressed in the white surcoat of the order if not for their swords which they rarely removed might easily have passed for their peaceable counterpart a religious order they were true enough but these were brothers in armsa fighting brotherhood first and a religious fraternity after they left us to ourselves for the most part pressed as they were with accommodating the sudden swelling of their ranks now and then we heard one or another of the templars exclaim as he discovered a countryman among the newly arrived recruits but otherwise the peace of the churchyard prevailed towards evening i began to worry that something had gone wrong at the citadel i went in search of the commanders sergeant and found him in the stables inspecting horses which had just arrived from gaul i greeted him and told him my concerns he listened but i could tell he put no faith in what i was telling him gislebert though he may have been a good soldier was not a friendly man we had been shipmates together after all and yet he treated me with cool almost callous indifferenceas if i had disappointed him in some crucial but inexpressible way and he was now forced to silently bear the brunt of my grievous inadequacy i can only think that renaud has suffered some misfortune i concluded after explaining the circumstances of our meeting with the prince otherwise he should have returned long since i am certain it is nothing he replied stiffly dismissing my concern as if it were the trifling qualm of a spoiled and fussy child the business of the garrison sometimes requires more particular attention than one unused to such matters may credit i suppose he meant to put me in my place with that he turned back to his inspection running his hand down along the foreleg of the horse before him a fine roan stallion i decided there was little to be gained by quarrelling with him and turned to go if he said for you to wait for him i expect he meant just that gislebert added over his shoulder as he turned away i heard him mutter under his breath only a fool would doubt him i stopped in midstep and turned around i am no fool sergeant gislebert i said sharply contrary to what you seem to think and i have every confidence in commander renaud yes he told us to wait for him here and all day we have done just that he also told us that he would soon follow clearly that did not happen therefore in light of the princes foul mood i do not think it foolish to inquire after the commanders welfare he straightened slowly regarding me with rank distaste i leave it with you gislebert it would be the work of a moment to prove me wrong after a moment he said what would you have me do my lord the words were worms in his mouth perhaps it would not be too much of an inconvenience to send a message to the templars at the citadel and ask them to discover what has detained the commander it will be done the sergeant replied grudgingly good i rejoined roupen and padraig and we waited some more twilight was full upon us and the smell from the kitchens was beginning to waft in through the open door growing restless i walked out into the yard and after strolling around aimlessly for a while sat down on the edge of the basin beside the fountain the sky was clear and the night fine a few bright stars shone overhead and the moon was already showing above the rooftops beyond the garrison walls i could see smoke drifting up from the houses round about i fell to thinking about what you gait might be doing at banvard at that moment i could see you playing on the shore gathering the glistening shells and holding them out for your grandmother ragnas inspection i was immersed in this daydream when i heard someone enter the yard i looked up to see gislebert striding quickly towards me it is as you feared he said bluntly visibly agitated he grimaced as forced to his admission he delivered the bad news prince bohemond has confined the commander to the palace so it is as i thought the sergeant squirmed with embarrassment i was able to inquire after him through the monks in the palace he is safe and well he sent a message you are to leave the city at once the commander tried to make him see reason but to no avail bohemond has commenced a search once they reach the lower city the garrison will no longer be safe the commander says you and the young lord must not wait any longer you must flee did he say where we were to go no my lord answered the sergeant although the commander imagines the young lord is anxious to return home as swiftly as possible he is extremely anxious i replied but speak plainly gislebert what does renaud intend us to do the sturdy soldier regarded me with dull implacability that is all i know sir i stared back at him wondering at the cryptic turn the discussion had taken it came to me that perhaps this was the difficulty the commander had alluded to beforehis vows of fealty prevented him from speaking more directly against the wishes of his liege lord sergeant did commander renaud tell you why we went to see bohemond he confides in me from time to time i believe i understand sergeant gislebert he nodded curtly i take it the matter is concluded yes then i expect you will be wanting to leave the city gates are soon closed and it would not be wise to wait until morning if there is nothing else i paused to allow him to say more if he would then we will be on our way sergeant padraig and roupen listened gravely as i told them what the sergeant had discovered unless we care to risk discovery in the city overnight we must go before they close the gates i did not like begging provisions from the templar quarter master but had no choice the markets if any could be found would be deserted and we had a long walk ahead of us padraig undertook to procure the bare necessities a few loaves of bread a little dried meat and three skins of waterenough to see us to saint symeon where we hoped to get a boat gislebert might have helped us on our way but he disappeared and was not seen again until as we made our way out of the garrison and onto the street the sergeant caught up with us to add one further complication to what had become a most mysterious flight the commander said that if he was ever forced to flee the city he would go to famagusta gislebert said meaningfully i had no idea where this might be nor did padraig or roupen it is a port on the island of cyprus the sergeant informed us and home to a man named yordanus hippolytus i repeated the name would it be worthwhile trying to find this fellow do you think perhaps gislebert allowed tentatively he is known to be a very great help to travellers in need with that obscurely significant message the sergeant hurried back into the garrison and we proceeded on our way true pilgrims carrying nothing but the cloaks on our backs the waterskins at our sides and the small bundle of provisions we would share out among us we flitted through the halfdeserted streets and reached the entrance to the city as the guards were preparing to close the gates for the night curiously they were just as wary of travellers trying to leave the city after dark as invaders trying to get in all gatemen are alike in this regard i think they view all who pass through their portals with deepest distrust never more so than when preparing to bar the doors for the night they halted us and questioned us closely and inspected us with scowls of disapproval if not for padraig who offered priestly reassurances on our behalf i do not think they would have let us go in the end we were allowed to pass through the small doorsthe larger gates were already shutand out onto the road by which we had come to antioch that very morning the rest we had enjoyed during the latter part of the day stood us in good stead however roupen worried as he was had not availed himself of the opportunity provided and so we were forced to go at a much slower pace and stop more frequently to rest than i would have preferred but there was nothing to be done about it the young lord was still not capable of much vigour and it would not help matters at all to exhaust him and bring on his illness again we allowed ourselves a drink at daybreak and again at midday when we stopped for a meal and a longer rest during the hottest part of the day as a precaution we removed ourselves a fair distance from the road and took shelter from the sun beneath some low blighted olive trees we ate our food quickly finishing the last of our scant provisions i kept watch on the road lest bohemonds pursuit catch us napping even so i saw no sign of frenzied chase we had the road and sky and empty hills to ourselves a short distance from this scrag of a grove stood a squalid little farm the crabbed fields of which yielded more stones than corn a few parched stalks drooped in the ovenhot air their withered leaves crackling on each fitful breath of wind that hard labour should be lavished on such hopeless soil would have been pitiable if it were not everywhere the same in that broken desert land for from all that i could see the holy land was but a great hot barren dust heap which everyone continually quarrelled over as if it were a paradise flowing with milk and honey instead of grit and gravel a wondrous realm of gold and jewels instead of rocks and thorns that anyone should greatly care who ruled this desert wasteland astounded me but that anyone should fight and die over the right to do so gave me to despair behold i thought grimly the triumph of avarice over sense of greed over sanity while taking our ease we discussed the plan for reaching our ultimate destination anazarbus in armenia it is a very great distance roupen assured us the wilderness is very rough and barren there are few roads and those that exist are not good at all we will certainly need help to get there and good horses i asked which direction armenia lay and how best to get there roupen explained that it was in the low taurus mountains to the north and that there were several routes the best way however is through mamistra he said we can get there by boat from famagusta mamistra is a sea port asked padraig no it is inlandon a river but the water is deep enough for boats and small ships it serves as the nearest sea port to anazarbus when the strength of the sun began to wane somewhat we pushed on again walking until dusk deepened around us i remained wary of any pursuit but saw no one until coming upon a group of venetian merchants camped beside the road for the night the merchants seven in all had been exploring trading opportunities in antioch and were on their way to ascalon in the south they greeted us pleasantly and invited us to share their evening meal and asked how we found life in the holy land padraig would have talked to them all day long but i thought it best not to encourage their interest too far so after wishing them well i begged to be excused explaining that we had walked all day and were very tired i scraped out a place among the rocks and thorns lay down and dozed contentedly until padraig nudged me awake at daybreak someone is coming he whispered i was just praying and heard horses on the road bohemonds men maybe they are still too far away to tell then we still have a chance we woke roupen and crept quietly away from the camp hiding in a dry ditch of a ravine a few hundred paces from the camp shortly there appeared three riders they reined up when they came upon the sleeping venetians although we could not hear what was said i could guess readily enough the riders roused the merchants with demands and questions the venetians looked around and shrugged as if to say we do not know if they are the men you are looking for they were here with us last night but they are gone now we cannot tell you more the riders did not linger but rode on quicklyno doubt in the hope of catching us a little further up the road after they were gone we waited in the ravine until the merchants departed as well and then continued on keeping a sharp watch on the road ahead for the returning soldiers we walked until midday and then stopped for another rest thinking to move on at dusk and walk through the night so that we could reach the harbour with a good chance of getting a ship before any sailed the next day this we did spending a quiet night out on the road beneath the stars so that we arrived at the little port town of saint symeon just after sunrise we saw no sign of the soldiers but two of the roundships were still in the bay dwarfing the smaller fishing vessels riding peacefully at anchor off shore we hurried down through the single narrow street to the harbour where roupen made a good account of himself by undertaking negotiations with a local fisherman for the hire of his boat to take us across to famagusta the sailor knew the place well and was pleased to have ready payment in silver for his services he called his son and one of his idle friends to help with the boat and after providing ourselves with a few loaves of bread a little wine and some boiled eggs and hard lumps of goat cheese we cast off as the boat slid out into the bay i scanned the road and hills for the last time for any sign of our pursuers there was nothing i decided that bohemond had made but a halfhearted attempt at apprehending us if he had been in deadly earnest his men would have caught us long since thus i concluded that he had directed his main efforts elsewhere and relaxed my vigilance the race i decided would not be to outrun pursuers but to reach anazarbus first towards this end i dedicated myself all that can be said of the voyage is that it was short and blessedly uneventful we reached the deepwater harbour on the eastern edge of cyprus on the evening of the second day and set to work seeking out the fellow named yordanus there was little harm in doing so i thought if for some reason we disliked the man or determined that making his acquaintance would be of little value to us we would simply move on and make our way to anazarbus by ourselves that evening as the moon rose over the quiet harbour nothing could have been more simple and straightforward but as i was learning nothing was ever simple and straightforward in outremer our search quickly ran aground on the fact that as night closed in no one would speak to strangers in the street in the end we were forced to take a room from a local wool merchant who put out part of his large house to visitors for a small fee for which he also provided an excellent meal we ate heartily and slept well in soft beds piled deep with fleeces and rose early next morning to renew our search for yordanuswith an everincreasing sense of urgency for every day we spent dallying along the trail bohemond was that much closer to launching his attack on anazarbus before leaving the wool merchants house we asked if he knew where we might find this yordanus hippolytus our goodnatured host had heard of the fellow oh yes he assured us he lives in the upper townthe old town he is a goldsmithfine man a very saint and given to many good worksif he is the man i am thinking of the man you are thinking of said the wool merchants wife does not live in the old town he lives in the big house at the end of the road behind the hill the sunny merchants face clouded how do you know who i am thinking of he demanded be quiet woman you will confuse these good men no more than you have confused them already she replied tartly take my advice and ask someone to show you the way to the house behind the hill the old town the wool man assured us pay no attention to my wife she is obviously thinking of someone else armed with this conflicting information we began our search in the old town as the merchant suggested for the price of a seed cake we hired a young boy at the harbour to show us the way to the old town he led us to the central market square where many of the artisans and traders had stalls from which they sold their wares they spoke greek in famagusta and since padraigs greek was better than mine he undertook to find out if anyone knew the man we sought oh yes said a maker of brass bowls he is well known he owns many ships if you wish to find him you must look down by the harbour for he is always there tending his fleet i thank you said padraig but we were given to understand that he was a goldsmith who owned a house in the old town seeing that strangers had come into the market several of the more idle traders gathered around to see if we might require anything they could supply oh no said the man i fear you were told a lie he owns no house but sleeps aboard his ship look for the biggest ship in the harbour that is yordanus ship what are you telling these men adonis the man you are talking about died last winter impossible cried the brass merchant i saw him only two days ago down at the harbour you saw a ghost perhaps said a second man a potter with large bare hairy arms covered in dried clay the ships are for sale do you wish to buy a ship he asked hopefully not just now padraig said later perhaps yordanus hippolytus did you say inquired another man pushing in his hands were red from the dye he used to stain the leather from which he made sandals and belts i know this man but he was never a ship owner he came from damascus where he grew figs a fig grower from damascus said the first man there is no such person in all of famagusta there is replied the sandal maker with admirable confidence he has a daughter who buys in the market i sold her a pair of sandals once and she said they were the best she had ever seen better even than damascus perhaps when you are finished here he offered helpfully you would like to buy some sandals or a belt maybe by the beard of saint peter sighed the potter these men are looking for their friend they do not want your sandals i make very good sandals insisted the craftsman and belts as well you should come and see them look here my friend said another there is no goldsmith by the name of yordanusor a ship owner either i have been selling for twentythree years in this market and i know everyone there is no one by that name the market traders fell to arguing with one another over the particularities of the mans identity turning to us padraig said i am thinking the wool merchants wife was right perhaps we should try to find the house behind the hill again what should have been a simple task took on unimagined difficulties no one we asked could tell us where this house might be as one of our cheerful guides told us the problem is not so much the house as the hill there are a great many hills in cyprus and most have houses roupen lost heart and was for returning to the harbour hiring a boat and leaving famagusta behind forever but having come this far and with the day already speeding from us i was growing more determined than ever to find this yordanus hippolytus padraig agreed with me if we do not find him today i promised roupen we will be on our way again tomorrow so we tramped around the hills above the port trying first one house and then another and came at last to a fine old roman villa surrounded by a crumbling wall in the road ahead i saw a woman carrying a jar in her arms she turned aside and entered through a low door in the wall it was hot and we were tired thinking merely to ask her for a drinkor at least for directions to a nearby well i quickened my step and followed her through the doorway and immediately found myself standing in the shaded courtyard of a oncehandsome villa there were large leafy plants in great earthenware pots around the perimeter of the yard and a small finelyformed fig tree growing in the centre beside a rockrimmed pool instantly the blazing heat of the day vanished and i felt as if i had entered a haven of peace and calm padraig and roupen appeared in the doorway behind me and stepped cautiously into the yard so came a voice from the shadows i was right you were following me i turned to see the woman watching us from behind one of the plants the jar still in her arms your pardon good lady i said quickly hoping to reassure her it was never my intention to alarm you it would take more than the sight of a ragged traveller to alarm me she replied stepping boldly into the courtyard tall and willowy with long dark hair her simple blue mantle hung in fresh folds except where she cradled the jar against the fullness of her breasts and the long curve of her hip what do you want here she demanded she spoke latin not greek but curiously accented each word taking on a flattened quality please we do not mean to intrude and yet you do intrude her gaze was direct and unsettling again i beg your pardon i replied somewhat abashed i had hardly spoken a dozen words and already i had apologized twice i returned her gaze almost daring her to interrupt again before i finished we are looking for the house of a man called yordanus why we have business with him liar she said he does not know you my lady be gone with you at oncebefore i call the servants to send you away remembering what the sandal maker had said about yordanus having a daughter i glanced at her feet and saw sandals the same shade of red as that which stained the merchants hands then this is his house i concluded yes but do not think you will see him he sees no one we have come a very great distance i told her all the way from antioch commander renaud de bracineaux sent us a cloud of suspicion passed over her face she stared at me for a moment and who is this commander de bracineaux she asked at last i had been told he was a friend of yordanus hippolytus he is your friend it was a simple question but i hesitated glancing at padraig who merely gazed placidly ahead i said we know commander de bracineaux and respect himbut we are not close friends no this admission seemed to appease her you can come in she said quickly adding just one of you i will ask if my father will receive you you go duncan padraig said as he and roupen sat down in the shade the woman led me across the yard and around the pool to a wide stonepaved walk leading to the entrance to the great house she did not pause but pushed open the large wooden door and stepped quickly in motioning for me to follow we entered the cool darkness of a vestibule dressed in marble and tiles the only light came from a small round window high above the door it cast a circle of illumination on the bluetinted tile of the far wall against which stood a row of statuessome entire human forms others headandshoulders only and all of them carved in the most wonderful pale milkwhite stone although i know nothing of such things they did appear to me to be very lifelike which i took to indicate a distinct skill on the part of their maker that a house should own one such carving was to me a sign of taste and refinement that this house should boast statues by the rank meant its owner possessed the wealth of a kingdom wait in there instructed yordanus daughter pointing to the chamber beyond and i will see if my father is well enough to receive guests she hurried away and i wandered into the next rooma vast chamber easily more than three times larger than murdos great hall back home and crammed with an assortment of tables chairs rugs cushions and other costly chattel ornate jars ewers bowls and platters were stacked carelessly on the tables and floor and numerous ceremonial spears and halberds with braided tassels and silk bindings stood against the walls what i had first taken for tiles on the floor on closer inspection turned out to be squares of fine polished wood cunningly arranged to form intricate patterns of alternating colours the two walls at either end of the hall were painted with figures on horseback riding to the hunt of two tusked beasts accompanied by a pack of enormous hounds the men in the painting carried spears and small round shields their clothing loosely flowing and brightly coloured in the manner still favoured by the potentates of the east the expansive ceiling was tinted the colour of the midday sky as i say the greater portion of the room was given to an accumulation of objects of various kinds rugs piled in a heap and others rolled up and tied in bundles resembling cut timber logs great jars and bowls of bronze and copper ceremonial weapons swords spears shields and the like and baskets of smaller objects cups and chalices by the score of horn and onyx and brass i counted seven enormous banqueting tables each large enough to seat twenty guests with comfort and a dozen or more smaller boards some of these were of gilded wood and carved with precision there were chairs too some as big as thrones i saw one or two which the jarl of orkneyjar would have boasted to own so enthralled was i with the inspection of my surroundings i failed to discern that i was being watched take anything said a dry husky voice in formal precise latin take as much as you can carry just leave us in peace i turned on my heel to see a gaunt baldheaded man standing in the doorway behind me he was tall and slopeshouldered limp hands hung loosely at his sides sharpfeatured with a large beaklike nose and narrow chin he put me in mind of a fisheagle his dark sad eyes and the severe downward bend of his damp mouth however gave him the unfortunate appearance of an extremely aggrieved fisheagle at first i imagined his doleful aspect resulted from the misapprehension that he had entered his home to confront a thief in the act of robberyan error i hastened to correct pax vobiscum i told him pray have no fear i am not a thief your daughter was good enough to admit me and i merely await her return he sniffed loudlyas if this explanation so obviously untrue was far beneath his lofty regardand continued to watch me with his sad eyes he was a taller man than he appeared he carried himself low and hunched over as if bent inward by weight on his neck in truth i said trying to make him understand i have been instructed to wait here he made no reply but continued staring at me you are yordanus i ventured i was he answered gravely he straightened and lifted his head yordanus hippolytus is no more the flesh of his neck was loose and hung in shapeless wattles much i noticed like the wrinkled skin of his upper arms who might you be i gave him my name and told him that my friends and i had come to cyprus from antioch and that we had been told by the commander of the templars to seek him out and ask his aid i hoped this would help him feel easier about my presence i was mistaken i care nothing for your troubles he said turning away abruptly take whatever you want and go leave me in peace he shuffled slowly away leaving me to gape after him twentytwo dearest caitriona something has happened which has me shuddering with a ferment of excitement i have not felt in a very long time an event of uncertain significance i realize yet i cannot bring myself to see it as anything other than a sign of great importance it would not be the first time a lonely prisoner saw in some minute and arbitrary alteration of his bleak life the false gleam of expectation i know still my mind races and my hands sweat with anticipation early this morningthe sun had not risen and the palace was dark the guards came for me i was roughly roused from sleep so i had no time to prepare my departure they would not even allow me to seal my missive to you dear heart fortunately wazim wakened by the noise came padding down the corridor and i was able to tell him what to do thus i went to face my fate secure in the knowledge that whatever befell me my labour of love would find its way to you one day accordingly i was hauled before caliph alhafiz to receive my judgement all was exactly as before indeed if i had not been aware of the passage of the last few days i might have imagined that i had left the room turned around in the corridor and returned to find everything as i had seen it only moments before the caliph splendid in his snowwhite turban with the peacock feathers still sat on his golden throne beneath his palm tree squinting with undisguised animosity as i was brought in i was shoved to my knees before him and made to kiss the polished stone floor whereupon i was jerked to my feet once more the caliph twitched his finger and the guards released me to stand upright in his presence he sat for a time gazing at me in a very hostile way and stroking his long grey moustache and i gazed back with as much serenity as i could summon so he said after a time they tell me you are very busy these days writing in your book that is true most excellent khalifa i try to occupy my time what is it that you write i am making an account of my captivity he said supplying the word himself travels my lord i corrected i am making an account of my travels in outremer he grunted and pulled on his moustache as he considered this reply i realized then that the man before me was discontented and oppressed by worry the eyes that gazed at me were fatigued and the day was new who will read this account of your travels i am making it for my daughter although she is still very young i hope that one day she will want to know what became of her father and she will read it for herself tcha he cried as if he had caught me in a lie how do you imagine she will receive this book of yours who will take it to her i cannot say how it will reach her i replied readily that is for his honourable potentate the khalifa to decide the answer caught him off guard for me to decide even so my lord it was promised in your name that my last request would be granted my last request is to have my writings reach my daughter the caliph turned his head and demanded of one of his many advisors is this so the man a darkbearded fellow with a basket of rolledup parchments beside him consulted the document before him and nodded it is so excellent and exalted khalifa the promise was given in recognition of the prisoners nobility according to the custom of baghdad the caliphs small eyes almost disappeared as his squint deepened he drew a deep breath through his nostrils and blew it out then said so shall it be done i bowed courteously i thank you my lord khalifa you love your daughter i suppose he said stiffly of course my lord she is the jewel of my heart and i cherish her beyond all measure a parent should love his children alhafiz declared as if instructing a stubborn pupil so it is written in the holy quran and in the bible i pointed out you are not afraid to die he observed no my lord are you so pure of heart and soul that you do not tremble to stand before the throne of divine judgement how should i tremble my lord when even now my righteous advocate intercedes before the throne on my behalf this appeared to interest the caliph this advocatewho is he he is jesu called the messiah i know of this messiah said alhafiz with an impatient twitch of dismissal among the faithful he is considered a very great prophet he frowned as if daring me to answer and asked why should this prophet intercede for you he intercedes for anyone who trusts in him i answered caliph alhafiz raised his chin indicating he was finished with me then we will see if this advocate has the ear of allah he said at the sixth hour your head will fall to the axe and you will stand before the throne of judgement may your advocates eloquence open the gates of paradise for you even though i knew it was coming hearing the words made me weak in the knees somehow i summoned the strength to bow in humble acceptance of his decision does this not concern you he demanded apparently rankled by my tranquil demeanour my lord khalifa i replied trying to keep my voice steady i love my life as much as any man but it is in your hands i am your servant judge me how you will you hope i will pity your insignificant faith and pardon you he said his voice taking on a defiant tone as if daring me to beg him to spare my life i already knew what i would say with all respect my lord my hope is in almighty god the merciful redeemer who alone holds the power of life and deathin this world and the next he stared at me and i thought i saw doubt creeping into the deeplycreased lines of his face suddenly as if the thought had just occurred to himhe said what do you know of affairs in cairo the question so surprised me i could not think how to answer why i know nothing of affairs in cairo i replied when he had repeated it once more i have been a prisoner of the palace since coming here i see no one and no one sees me just so he declared triumphantly and i understood the question had been a test but what it was meant to reveal i could not grasp gesturing to the guards he ordered them to take me back to my cell i was swept from his presence and returned to my cell where i spent my last moments praying and preparing myself for the grim ordeal ahead i do not know how much time passedit seemed i spent an eternity on my kneesand i heard footsteps outside my door once more i heard the key in the lock and rose to meet the guards who would conduct me to the place of execution it was wazim who entered however and he was alone daounk he said his face beaming like a swarthy sun good tidings the execution is delayed delayed relief flooded through me why i was not told the reason he answered but i know there is some trouble in the city and the khalifa has sent all the guards to deal with it he has said that no prisoners are to be executed until peace is regained is that not wonderful indeed i agreed that it was wonderful and asked what is the trouble why should the executions be delayed i do not know what has happened wazim said but if you wish i will make it my duty to find out do you wish it instantly i recalled the caliph asking me what i knew of events in cairo inasmuch as i owed my physical wellbeing to affairs in the city it made sense to learn more about them if i could yes i told him find out all you can please with pleasure daounk grinning wazim left my cell i heard him scurrying away and after a heartfelt prayer of thanksgiving for my stay of execution i returned to my table after a long time pondering the implications of the unforeseen development in my situation i picked up my quill once more and returned to the work at hand leaving the house of yordanus hippolytus i rejoined roupen and padraig in the yard they were sitting beside the little pool talking quietly taking one look at the expression on my face padraig said he refused to see you no i saw him he refused to help us i quickly explained that i had told him of commander renauds recommendation he said he did not care about our troubles then i say we shake the dust off our feet roupen said we have wasted enough time with this already he rose abruptly we never should have come here in the first place we would be halfway to anazarbus by now if we had not listened to that templar i was forced to agree with him and we decided our best course was to return to the harbour and see if we could find a boat to hire although considering the little we had left from bezus largesse i reckoned our chances very slender nevertheless we started from the yard and as i passed through the low gateway i heard someone calling me and looked back to see yordanus daughter hurrying towards us i told the others to wait a moment and turned back where are you going she asked i thought you wanted to see my father i have seen him i replied he did not wish to help us he said he did not care about our troubles he says that to everyone she sighed i should have warned you her brusque manner had softened somewhat and i wondered why he can be difficult to understand sometimes i understood him perfectly well i am sorry to have troubled you i thanked her for her help and took my leave you will excuse me my friends are waiting dont go the desperation in her voice brought me up short my lady please dine with us tonight i will speak to my father he will receive you in a far better mood i promise you now it was my turn to frown we have spent all day trying to find this place only to be told to go awayfirst by you and then by your father now that we are about to do just that you sayyou want us to stay she smiled suddenlya delicious winsome flash of fine white teeth against the tawny hue of her skin for the first time i realized she was of an eastern race for her colouring was darkher hair and eyes were black and radiantly so and her flesh glowed with a lustrous sheen the colour of honey mingled with cream our business is urgent i told her we dare not waste time indulging the whims of an old man please she said laying a hand on my arm you need to eat somewhere and it is a long time since we have welcomed guests beneath our roof dine with us tonight and let us see what comes of it she was right the day was rapidly dwindling away and we would have to find somewhere to stay for the night we had come this far i thought we might as well see it through to the end very well i said i will speak to my friends good she said brightening instantly fetch them back and i will show you where you can rest and refresh yourselves i hurried out through the gate and told padraig and roupen there had been a change of plan upon rejoining yordanus daughter in the courtyard she said as we are to dine together i must go to the marketplace it is cool here in the courtyard and there is water in the pool to refresh yourselves i will return soon i thanked her for her thoughtfulness but as she made to take her leave roupen suddenly demanded do you mean you would eat with them before i could reply he added i will not eat with jews with that he pointed to a bronze disc over the door of the house it showed the outline of two simple triangles one inverted and imposed upon the other to form the star of david a symbol much employed by the jews i will not put my feet beneath the same board as a jew roupen growled angrily do what you like i will not break bread with them i would rather starve first then you may do so i told him bluntly aghast at his crude incivility i had never seen him so irritated and angry they are jews he protested unashamedly they cannot be trusted we do not need them anyway i am leaving with that he spun on his heel and hastened off down the road padraig flew after him attempting to calm him and bring him back to beg forgiveness mortified by the young lords discourtesy i quickly turned to apologize i am sorry my lady he is distraught and upset by the urgency of our predicament but that is no excuse for his uncouth behaviour and what about you she asked sharply do you also hold jews in such low regard i confess i have never known any jews i answered desperate to make amends i added still if they are even half so kind and generous as you have been then they are indeed a noble raceand i will fight anyone who says otherwise she gave the remark a dismissive huff and stared at me her dark eyes searching mine as she pursed her lips in thought after a moment she said do you still wish to eat with us i would consider it an honour my lady then you may return this evening with pleasure i replied trying to redeem a bad business in the meantime i will calm my young friend and teach him better manners do so the lady replied crisply you may also find it worthwhile to meditate on this my father and i are not jews no we are copts she said and disappeared into the courtyard slamming the door behind her twentythree we spent what little remained of the day in the market square of the upper town under padraigs ministrations and mollified by the fact that our host was not a jew after all the haughty young lord allowed himself to be persuaded to partake of a meal without further insult as a pale yellow moon rose above the surrounding hills we found ourselves once more standing before the low door in the high wall at the end of the long uphill climb there was an iron ring hanging from a chain beside the door padraig gave the ring a strong pull and a bell chimed distantly from somewhere inside we waited for a time and nothing happened so he pulled it again and then once more for good measure the monk was about to pull the bell yet again when the door flew open and a small brown man poked out his head he spat a stream of invective which none of us could understand and then slammed the door again there you see grumbled roupen only too ready to abandon what appeared to be an increasingly hopeless enterprise pull the bell chain i directed refusing to give in again the door flew open and again the man glared and jabbered fiercely at us this time however i reached in took hold of his tunic and yanked him out into the street he sputtered and cursed and began kicking at us with his bony bare feet peace i said holding him back we mean you no harm stop your fighting we only want to talk to you he loosed a blistering torrent of angry words at us all the while kicking and swinging his fists i held him at arms lengthas much to keep him from hurting himself as any of us and was considering what to do next when there appeared in the open doorway a very fat man in a loosefitting robe he looked at us with a large languid unimpressed eye and said yes i greeted him politelystill holding off the angry little manand said yordanus is pleased to receive us for dinner this evening so you say replied the man wholly unmoved by my declaration reaching out he tapped the squirming spitting man squarely on top of the head instantly he stopped righting i released him and he scurried away have you something for me asked the fat man when the little porter had gone uncertain how to reply i glanced at padraig who merely shrugged unhelpfully no i answered at last should i have something for you that is for you to say i was given nothing for you i told him pity he replied he rolled his eyes lazily from one to the other of us then sighed and fell silent is yordanus at home i wondered after an awkward moment the fat man yawned then turned and beckoned us to follow the three of us stepped through the doorway and crossed the deepshadowed courtyard we were led to the door of the villa wait here the man instructed he pushed open the door and vanished into the darkness within in a little while the small wiry fellow returned he saw us waiting before the door and instantly flew at us shouting and waving his hands he seemed determined to drive us from the house and might have succeeded save for the abrupt appearance of yordanus daughter she wore a long white robe and carried a lash of braided leather with which she proceeded to whip the little man go to omer she cried swinging the lash go to i was about to interpose myself in this attack when i noticed that most if not all the whip strokes struck the earth the desired effect was achieved however and the little mad fellow ran off gibbering you must forgive omer the lady said recoiling the lash he is not often well stepping to the door she said come this way please the house was in darkness and we crept like thieves through one passage after another until coming to a room in one of the long wings of the extensive villa the chamber was ablaze with candlelight and the windows were open to allow the soft evening breezes to waft in setting candles fluttering on the large candletrees around the room there were no chairs but after the fashion of the east we reclined on large cushions either side of the low table which had been spread with fine ornatelywoven damascus cloth while in the marketplace padraig and i had taken the opportunity to have our clothes brushed so as to present a slightly less disagreeable presence at the board upon entering the dining chamber the lady offered a wash basin filled with scented water roupen however did himself a great dishonour by not only refusing the wash basin but scowling at everyone and everything as if enduring humiliations to his dignity so intense as to be physically painful the lady departed leaving us to our ablutions we were alone only a moment when she reappeared if not for the fact that i had just seen her i would not have known her as the same person having removed the white robe she now wore a gown of the lightest most delicate fabric i have ever seen what is more the thin stuff shimmered in the candlelight glistening with a lustre like that of moonbeams on water it was blue as the midnight sky and cut low over her bosom to reveal the graceful swell of her breasts a wide cloth belt of gold gathered the gown at her slender waist emphasizing the curve of her hips her dark hair hung in loose curls over her bare shoulders unexpectedly the sight of her slender shapely arms sent a pang of longing through me of an intensity i had not experienced since my own dear rhona held me to her heart it was all i could do not to stare openly at her as she invited us to sit and make ourselves comfortable saying my father has been informed of your arrival he will join us when he is ready your graciousness my lady is exceeded only by your loveliness i said wishing i had something better to offer her than common flattery still she smiled at the compliment and it came into my mind that despite her assured and forward manner she was not as confident as she appeared truly she lived in a madhouse and was likely unaccustomed to common courtesy my name is sydoni she told me i am duncan of caithness i replied offering her my hand in greeting she placed her hand in mine without hesitation and lifting it i lightly brushed it with my lips i then introduced her to padraig and roupen i was explaining who they were and how we came to be together when yordanus entered the room grim and tightlipped he acknowledged us with chilly if not hostile indifference and the meal commenced our unhappy host reclined at the head of the table with the peevish and sour disposition of a man being bent into an unbecoming shape full of sighs and prickly noises he fumed and fretted giving every sign that he wished to be anywhere else in all the world but where he found himself just now shameful behaviour in a host to be sure and it might have spoiled the evening save for the fact that i only had eyes for sydoni and she ignored her fathers unpleasantness to the point of invisibility clearly the evening was hers and she was not about to allow anyone to ruin it once we were all seated sydoni presented us with small bowls of peeled pears cooked in a sweet sauce cooled and seasoned with a spice i had never tasted before tangy pungent it gave a warm tingle to the mouth and tongue when i asked what it was sydoni smiled and said it is called cinnamon roupen grunted at this as if to say it was a commonplace too drearily familiar to mention i thought it wonderful however and praised it loudly i praised the next dish also fish roe and curds of soft new cheese with cream and flavoured with garlic and lemon all mixed together to form a thick paste into which we dipped strips of flat bread there was sweet wine too and several kinds of bread and grapes when we had eaten our fill of these things sydoni brought out the next dish roast quail stuffed with bread crumbs pine nuts and herbs glazed with honey the succulent birds were done to such perfection even roupen begrudgingly commended the art of the cook before i knew it i had eaten two of them and was reaching for a third when i saw sydoni watching me she smiled the proud contented smile of a woman well satisfied with herself it was a look i knew well rhona had often worn the same expression when serving me something she knew i enjoyed the food and wine worked their ageold magic and gradually both roupen and yordanus began to grow more amiable as the meal went on the surly young lord became quite pleasant and the sour old man grew sweettempered and convivial fill the cups he cried at one point thrusting his beaker into the air i want to drink the health of my new friends happy to oblige i took up the jar and poured the good red wine yordanus then raised his cup high and said i drink to friendship health and peace gods blessing on all his children we acclaimed this sentiment with cheers whereupon our host said may the lord of the feast eternally bless us with good food good wine and dear friends around the board for ever and always amen roupen affirmed the benediction but could not let the comment pass lord of the feast he said when everyone had drunk that is a title which belongs to christ i should have thought yordanus turned his head and regarded the young man quizzically yes strange words from the mouth of a copt roupen observed with wineinduced carelessness the old man stiffened the smile hardened on his face and his eyes narrowed roupen seeing he had offended his host looked to me for help but i remained silent and left him to face the consequence of his intolerance i meant nothing more than that he offered weakly why does everyone look at me so you think copts unworthy of salvation asked yordanus quietly bristling roupen redfaced now raised a hand in defence of his blunder i meant no disresp you think because i am a copt i am less a christian than you yordanus challenged growing rigid with indignation i made to intercede for the young man but padraig prevented me let him squirm the priest whispered it will teach him a lesson yordanus stared with dull anger at the impudent young lord once he said his voice growing cold i would not have suffered an insult beneath the roof of my own house but he lifted his bony shoulders in a shrug of heavy resignation i am not the man i used to be he extended a long finger towards roupen it is lucky for you that i am not father please said sydoni reaching across to tug his sleeve the old man raised his hands that is all i will say rising to his feet he threw down his empty cup you must excuse me i am tired i am going to bed roupen stricken and guilty stammered please sir i am the one who should leave and i will do so he jumped up from his place before i go i will beg your pardon and ask your forgiveness for the offence i have caused please accept my deepest apologies he spoke with such contrition that yordanus urged by the silent entreaty of his daughter grudgingly relented oh very well the old man said sit down young man sit down there is no harm done he sighed and forced a sad smile flapping a hand at the young lord he said come sit down we will put this unfortunate misunderstanding behind us reluctantly roupen lowered himself to his place once more yordanus gazed at him for a moment for more than thirty generations the old man said thrusting his finger skyward the house of hippolytus has been a christian housebefore byzantium before rome before the gospel of christ was proclaimed in the streets of athens we were christians an ancestry to glory in padraig remarked if every family could claim such long obedience this world would not labour under so great a weight of faithlessness and falsehood indeed sir said yordanus proudly when the followers of the way were thrown out of the high temple at jerusalem where they were meeting in those days my ancestors were there on the day that the blessed stephen was put to death my ancestors carried his poor battered corpse to the tomb when the persecution began the infant church scatterednorth south east westwherever they hoped to escape the terrible oppression of the mob and the tyranny of the temple leaders yordanus raised his cup and sydoni emptied the last of the jar into it he drained the cup and said but all that was a very long time ago no one wants to hear it now roupen duly chastised and anxious to make whatever amends he might quickly said if you please sir i would hear it certainly that was the right thing to say for the old mans eyes rekindled with a spark of his former gladness well perhaps i will just say this one thing moreso to improve your understanding yordanus conceded swiftly overcoming his reluctance taking up a small bronze bell from the table he rang it vigorously several times and then said jerusalem became too dangerous so my people fled south since the time of the great patriarch abraham whenever trouble threatened in palestine the jews took refuge in egypt this my people did and in egypt they stayed in time we became egyptians and those of us who remained staunch in the faith became known as copts my ancestors prospered greatly they became traderssome with fleets and some with camels some with important stalls in the principle markets of the great cities this is the life that was handed down to me i became a trader after my own fashion and my son likewise at these words a shadow passed over the old mans face his voice faltered my son he paused cleared his throat and finished saying once the extent of my interests stretched from the banks of the nile to the tops of the tarsus mountains now all that is gone gone and finished and dead like my son the last hope of my illustrious line yordanus raised his eyes and smiled sadly i am sorry he said sinking once more into himself my grief is a burden i did not intend forcing upon you forgive an old man he paused during which time the fat man who had met us at the door appeared gregior yordanus ordered bring us more wine the sullen servant turned without a word and lumbered off and try not to drink it all before it reaches the table his master called after him i do not believe in keeping slaves explained yordanus but i make an exception for gregior and omer they are hopeless you must agree if i turned them out they would soon starve and i cannot in good christian conscience allow that to happen so i keep them for their own good as no one else would have them he smiled weakly and spread his hands i apologize for your sorry reception mind you it would have been no different for anyone else be you caliph or king beggar leper or thief omer would treat you exactly the same what language does he speak asked padraig i could not make out a word of it so far as i know it is no language at all answered our host chuckling to himself omer imagines he is speaking latin but so long as i have known him i have never had so much as a single intelligible word out of him in any tongue whatsoever he shook his head wearily hopeless the wine arrived in a great silver jar and sydoni poured it into the cups which yordanus offered to us once more saying i drink to my friends old and new may the high holy one keep you all in the hollow of his hand amen we drank and our host placing his cup firmly on the table said now then to business tell me why did our templar friend de bracineaux send you to old yordanus twentyfour yordanus listened with halfclosed eyes while i made a brief account of the events which had led us to his door he nodded and glanced at padraig as i described how the priest and i had come to be on pilgrimage and how we had met the templars and young lord roupen in rouen and all that had flowed from that meetingall that is save for bohemonds plan to reclaim the armenian stronghold at anazarbus i thought it best to keep that to myself when i finished at last yordanus frowned mildly and said a fascinating tale to be sure yet you have omitted one or two significant details i think no doubt you have your reasons but if i am to help you he turned his palm up as if offering me a choice i hesitated trying to decide whether to risk telling him more he saw my reluctance and pressed me further for example he continued you have not said why you were forced to flee from antioch so quickly lifting a hand to roupen he added would i be wrong in thinking your troubles whatever they may be began and ended with your young friend here not far wrong i replied cautiously roupen lowered his eyes but said nothing come now my friends if i am to help you i must know everything about this affair what have you done impugned the princes virtue sullied the patriarchs good name stolen the rood of antioch at mention of the holy cross my heart clutched in my chest forgive me my lord i said quickly but i did not care to burden you with our troubles unnecessarily he waved the feeble excuse aside tell me so i told him of prince bohemonds intention to attack the armenian stronghold and how padraig and i hadout of friendship for roupen and at the strangely veiled behest of the templar commander determined to thwart the impetuous princes ambition if we could we went to him to ask him to repent of his plan i concluded unfortunately things got out of hand and de bracineaux was taken prisoner in the citadel padraig roupen and i were forced to flee before bohemond could capture us as well the good commander suggested we come to you yordanus plucked a red plum from a basket and bit off the end he sucked the juice for a moment and then observed it seems to me that your path has been prepared from the beginning indeed i wondered padraig nodded smiling as he regarded the old man with as i thought renewed respect and appreciation pushing himself back from the table the old man beamed expansively rejoice my friends he declared yordanus hippolytus is the one man in the whole world with both power and inclination to speed you to your purpose glancing at the young lord who had yet to exchange his wary haunted expression for a more mirthful countenance the ageing trader leaned over and gave him a fatherly pat on the arm be of good cheer your adversaries though they be legion have now to deal with me eh i did not know we had so many enemies roupen replied struggling to rise to the occasion for a fact you do yordanus told him there are many in this part of the world who would love nothing more than to see the armenian house obliterated by the swiftest means possible unsavoury perhaps but it is the truth turning to padraig and me he asked now then who else knows about your errand de bracineaux of course i replied and bohemond probably too by now added padraig no one else apart from you and your daughter i glanced at sydoni who was leaning on her palm and gazing at me no one have you spoken to anyone along the way not a soul i said padraig shook his head roupen looked glumly ahead well and good yordanus rose stiffly from his cushion his mind made up we must work quickly the necessary arrangements must be made we begin tonight it was late and i was exhausted traipsing through the hills all day had taken their toll tonight forgive me you are tired from your travails leave everything to me take your rest and in the morning god willing we will be ready to depart he rang the bell and summoned gregior to lead us to the guest rooms we bade goodnight to our hosts and went to bed in far better spirits than we had enjoyed for many days padraig stayed up a little longer saying his prayers but i lay down and slipped at once into a deep and dreamless sleeponly to be roused some time later by the whispered hush of urgent voices in the courtyard i listened for a while but was too sleepy to make anything of it and soon drifted off again the next thing i knew someones hands were on me shaking me awake i sat up with a start peace said sydoni crouching beside me all is well but it is time to leave she rose gregior has brought you a basin of water i will leave you to wash and dress join us in the great hall as soon as you are ready she left and as i scraped my scattered thoughts together i heard her in the next room waking the young lord with an explanation of our purpose i stumbled to the steaming basin and washed praising the gifting giver for the luxury of soap i then dried myself quickly on the linen cloth provided dressed and lumbered out the door and down the long cloistered corridor of the villa to the great hall the sky was dark and daybreak still somewhat distant by my estimation yawning i joined yordanus sydoni and the others already gathered inside the door of the great hall gregior was ambling here and there lethargically lighting candles and throwing dark glances at his master who scurried around the enormous room beckoning us to follow we caught up with him pawing through a pile of old maps stacked high on one of the many tables in the room here see here this he pointed to a black spot in the centre of the map this is antioch the port of saint symeon is here and he moved his finger a fair way up a wavy line representing the coast and brought it to rest on a brown spot just below a tiered stretch of jagged sawtooth mountains anazarbus there frowning roupen bent down and examined the crude representation of his home see here yordanus continued tracing the route to antioch with his finger bohemond must go overland because he has no ships to carry so many men and horses and supplies two roundships were still in the harbour at saint symeon when we left padraig pointed out it makes no difference asserted yordanus with conviction he had assumed the aspect of a man very much younger than he had shown himself to be he became decisive and earnest and i realized i was seeing a glimpse of the man he had once been two you say two ships would not even carry enough fodder for the horses he would need twenty at least so he continued resuming his reckoning bohemonds army must go on foot but it is far faster by way of marionis on the coast here he placed a long finger on a small spot on the coast north of antioch from there mamistra is easily reached on the river see it there he indicated another black wavy line which was the river to another brown smudge north and a little west of the port from mamistra it is horseback the rest of the way with good luck and gods speed anazarbus is but ten days ride from the river even if prince bohemond marshalled his troops and marched the same day you fled antioch you will reach the city at least four or five days ahead of the prince and his army he glanced up to make certain that we all understood you are frowning again my friends now what is the matter we have some money with us i explained but not enough to buy horses but i have money enough for anything said yordanus rubbing his hands enthusiastically and i am going with you gregior run and fetch my box the old traders sudden industry was amazing it was as if he had shed not only the dull languor and melancholy which had gripped him so tightly but entire decades of years as well the sluggish servant returned with a small chest made of a dark heavy wood yordanus opened the box and withdrew three leather bags then bethought himself and took three more here he said thrusting three of the bags at me a man on a journey can never have enough money thanking my host for his thoughtfulness and generosity i tied one of the purses to my belt and gave the other two to padraig to carry in his monks satchel with your help we shall travel like kings i told him ragged kings at best yordanus said indicating our clothes fortunately i have something for you he crossed to a large chest and threw open the lid delving into the chest he began tossing lengths of cloth and various garments onto the floor around him ah here here he said at last and brought out a long flowing garment like an overlong tunic made of fine lightweight cloth it was the colour of the northern sea as night sweeps in from the east there were trousers of the same cloth and colour and new boots of soft leather the sides of which were stitched with coloured thread in a plumed emblem the tunics sleeves were long and wide but close around the wrists the trousers were secured around the waist with a long cloth belt of woven purple strips to which hundreds of tiny bronze discs had been attached in all it was the raiment of an eastern prince and although i was impressed i could not imagine myself wearing such a garment people will think i am pretending to be an arab i said i will feel foolish it would be better to stay as i am nonsense said yordanus ignoring my objections your clothes are unsuitable for the rigours of the journey ahead not only that they mark you out as a stranger and an outsider if you wish to travel swiftly without arousing unwanted interest in your affairs you must not fly the banner of the ignorant foreigner sydoni agreed with him and after my initial scepticism i allowed myself to be convinced despite his protests that he was a monk dyed in the wool of his monastery padraig too came in for the same treatment in the end we changed our clothes and marvelled at the difference i felt cooler and more comfortable instantly and bade farewell to my tattered homespun in favour of the lighter eastern stuff only when both padraig and i were suitably attired did sydoni allow us to leave the house i will see you as far as the harbour she told us leaving the villa we crossed the darkened courtyard and waited while gregior unlocked the door then slipped out onto the deserted road we hurried down the hill through the new town and continued on to old famagusta and the quiet harbour as crimson sunrise broke in the east i will speak to the harbour master directly yordanus told us as we came onto the quay he will know which sailors are available for hire and of those who can be trusted as it happens volunteered padraig we know our way around a ship count us among the sailors splendid said the trader the fewer who know our business the better among the vessels riding peacefully at anchor on the tranquil crescent of blue water there were the usual fishing boats plus a few more substantial craft used by the island traders there were also four large ships which i took to be of venetian or genoan origin i was wrong upon arriving at the wharf yordanus pointed to the four large ships and said my beauties which one do you like the best the smallest i replied thinking how much work it would be raising sail the fastest suggested padraig the canny priest was as usual closer to the mark that would be persephone the old man said indicating the long low vessel at the end of the line although painted in the greek stylewith a green hull a slender red mast and a rail and keel of bright yellowthe ship owed more to the ancient roman design which had held sway in that part of the world for a thousand years or more not the smallest but she fairly flies before the lightest breeze with gods help and a good wind we will be in anazarbus before bohemond makes the syrian gates twentyfive cait you will not believe what has taken place i can scarce believe it myself and hardly know where to begin to explain nor can i say with any certainty whether it is good news for me or bad good i think for if nothing else it has delayed my execution for another day at least maybe more lord of hosts in heaven let it be more after dismissing wazim to learn what he could of matters in the city i returned to my writing and thought no more about what the caliph had said about the affairs of cairo you have been reading the result of my diligence this account grows more ungainly by the day i confess and my poor hand cramps and burns and the effort tires mecait sometimes i feel as if i have been wrestling giants from dawn to dusk though i have not stirred from the chair nevertheless i worked through the day and into the nighta common enough practice for me to be sure the only difference was that this time no meals were brought to me i assumed this was because i was soon to die and the grim assumption spurred me on tired as i was i worked all the more diligently for the knowledge that each page before me might be my last it was very late when i again heard rapid footsteps in the corridor i lay aside my pen and turned as wazim burst into the room excitement making his eyes bulge out he had gone out to discover what it was that had caused the caliph to suspend the ordered executions and he had returned with the tale which has caused such alarm throughout the city and which i shall swiftly relate first however i must explain a detail which is necessary for your understanding you will have gathered that the caliph is supreme among muhammedan rulers yet he is not singular in his authority not by any means he shares the administration of his government with other authorities chief among them the waziror vizier as some say this he does so that he may undertake more fully his primary duty as the spiritual leader of his people thus leaving the ordinary charge of temporal matters to the vizier as it happens the caliph of cairo however fortunate in other respects is cursed with a wayward and unruly son hasan the caliph upon taking the throne had struck upon the idea of at once making peace with the stormy youth and bringing him under his control by raising the young man to the rank of vizier wazim tells me that while many counselled against this the plan nevertheless worked very well at first after a time however hasan began to find his office too constricting he drifted back into his former bad habits soon he was once more the bane of his fathers life only this time he was placed where he could work great harm to any and all who opposed him although none of this reached my ears it was well known all along the nile from alexandria to luxor for the wicked young man ran from one tantrum to the next plunging the government of cairo into scandals and skirmishes of every kind matters grew so precarious and unpleasant and the outcry of aggrieved citizens so loud that the caliph had lately begun to entertain the suggestions of his advisors who insisted that vizier hasan must be deposed this i suspect had been behind alhafizs inquiry into what i knew about affairs in cairobut more of that later so there it is all that remains is for me to say that on the day my execution was to have been effected vizier hasan on an insane whim summoned no fewer than forty amirs and atabegs from the city and surrounding region to meet with him that he might receive their heartfelt homage once they were assembled he charged them with plotting against him thinking it a crude jest the noblemen made light of it enraged that they should laugh at him he had them thrown into a hafira grain house and then ordered the warriors of his personal bodyguard to slay them all then and there without weapons or aid of any kind there was very little the noblemen could do the soldiers waded into the hafir killing all who stood up to them the rest were butchered one by one as they tried to escape i listened with dread amazement at wazims gruesome tale when did this happen i asked when he finished daounk at the very moment you stood before the caliphs throne of judgement he answered even then this black deed was taking place forty amirsall dead he said shaking his head at the grotesque audacity of it everyone is most upset i can see how that would be i allowed what has become of the vizier the khalifa as you know was forced to send out the guards they surrounded the viziers palace and demanded hasan to give himself up to them he refused and there was a small battle wazim paused to gulp down some air and then hurried on when the viziers bodyguard saw it was futile to fight against the khalifas soldiers they surrendered and delivered hasan to his fathers troops it is said they have taken the vizier out of the city to a secret fortress where he is to be held until khalifa alhafiz can decide what shall be done with him now gait that is how the matter sits at the moment as padraig so often reminds me all things work together for the good of him who loves the lord great of heaven this is my prayer even now sydoni would not be left behind while her father discussed suitable crew members with a sleepy harbour master sydoni offered to show us around the ship taking one of the small boats padraig and roupen rowed us to where the trim persephone was anchored and we climbed up onto the deck once aboard it quickly became clear that she had no intention of being put off when the last of the provisions had been brought aboard and stowed below deck yordanus turned to bid farewell to his daughter save your breath father she said kissing him lightly on the cheek i am going with you he was against it there was a brief discussion and of course she had her way the more i saw of sydoni the more convinced i became that if she wanted a thing it was hers already and no amount of argument would sway her likewise flattery threats or reason in this i suspect she was just like her father and even he could not compel her against her will thus with the help of two additional sailors and a pilot we set off well before midday persephone was a fine ship neat and spare in its lines but able to hold a sizeable cargo with ease as we had no cargo the pilot and his two crewmen were able to manage the ship almost entirely on their own once under sail they required only an occasional hand from padraig and myself leaving us plenty of time to ourselves the first day at sea was a joy the wind stayed light out of the west but the ship surged along pleasantly it felt good to be moving forwards with such efficiency and speed and with such righteousness of purpose very soon our hearts were soaring and our worries seemed to recede like the island behind us quietly exhilarated by the inevitable success of our mission i allowed myself to accept yordanus assurances that bohemond could not possibly outrace us and that we would reach anazarbus to deliver our warning long before the greedy prince and his army thus the pressing urgency of our flight began to recede towards evening dolphins gathered to sport before the prow sydoni liked watching them and drawn by her exuberance i joined her at the rail to see them leap and dive they say that dolphins are naughty children who taunted neptune from the safety of the shore sydoni told me in his anger the god sent a great sea wave to sweep the children off their rock and drown them but old nereus did not have the heart to see them killed and so gathered them up and changed them into fish instead i have never heard that story i said but seeing how they play in the waves i can well believe it we watched the sleek dark shapes dart and glide splashing in and out of the waves slicing the wake with their agile fins and weaving trails of bubbles as they rolled and spun in the firerimmed water on the deck behind us the sailors had lit a small brazier and the aroma of spitroasted fish began to steal into the air i love the sea sydoni said lazily resting her chin on her palm as she leaned on the rail i have spent half my life on ships and yordanus i asked because the doughty old trader had gone below deck shortly after we left sight of land and had not put his head above the boards since he is the worst seaman on any sea she observed gleefully the least little ripple in the water and poor yordanus turns green and goes below vexing for a man who must make his living aboard a ship she looked at me for a moment the setting sun glinting in her dark hair and turning her dusky skin to warm glowing bronze yes she agreed softly even as she said it i knew she had been about to say something else to confide more personally but had pulled back at the last instant silence fell between us and i thought she would not say more with a last flash of pale underbelly the dolphins dove down into the darkening water disappearing in a trail of bubbles but sydoni did not seem to notice she went on staring down at the waves a pensive look on her face i want to thank you for saving my father i opened my mouth to dispute her claim but saw that she was in earnest did he need saving she turned her face towards the far horizon he was dying in that house the way she spoke made it sound like a prison he had lost interest in his food his affairs life itselfyou saw how he was i see he has changed i agreed he has become a very lion on our behalf yes and that is because of you i am grateful my lady i have done nothing your father has taken an interest in our troubles for reasons of his own and has decided to help us believe me i am the one who should be gratefuland i am i do not expect you to understand she said stiffly and moved away along the rail that night we sat on the broad uncluttered deck and ate flat bread and roast fish basted in olive oil and sprinkled with dried herbs and salt the moon rose slowly in a clear sky and made the sea bright sydoni went below deck as soon as she finished eating taking a little food for her father padraig roupen and i sat and talked to the sailors all three of whom had travelled to and from the holy land many times when the others went to bed i decided to walk around the deck a little before going down to my berth to sleep i strolled idly letting the tranquillity of the night seep into my soul my thoughts turned to prayers and i prayed for the family i had left at home and for the swift and successful completion of our journey so occupied by my devotions i did not notice that i was no longer alone i heard a soft footfall beside me and glanced around to find sydoni watching me i am sorry to disturb you she said softly not the least apologetic she stepped nearer i am finished a fine night she observed tilting her face towards the heavens i can never sleep when the moon is so bright and the air is so warm i often sit out alone all night watching the moon and stars i have been known to do the same at home still gazing skyward she asked is it nice where you live it is very different from here i told her and very different i would think from your home in egypt she smiled her teeth a glint of whiteness in the dark not all copts are born within sight of the nile i have never lived in egyptnor has my father but i thought i grew up in damascus she explained no doubt i would have lived there all my life it is a glorious city or used to be i was very happy there why did you leave we were forced to flee she replied her voice darkening slightly and we were not alone three thousand christians were driven from their homes that day we were far more fortunate than most many lost everything including their lives they took most of the ready gold and silver but we were allowed to bring anything else we could carry was it because of the crusade i asked sydoni gave a slight shake of her head no it was the fidain the wondered at the word what is a fedayeen the fidain she corrected have you never heard of them no i told her but i have not been long in the holy land i wish i had never heard of them they are vile and hateful murderers she replied with disgust some call them batinis those who hold a hidden faith it is because of them that we were forced to leave damascus as if fearing she had said too much she fell silent i tried to engage her in conversation again but she said she was tired and soon went below leaving me alone once more and gazing at the stars the next day neither she nor her father showed themselves above deck before midday padraig and i spent the morning fishing and caught enough for our dinner that night i told the priest about what sydoni had said the night before and asked if he had ever heard of the fidain he like myself professed ignorance so we asked roupen where did you hear about them he looked around the bare deck as if he thought they might be hiding behind the mast ready to leap out on us sydoni told me i replied she said they were the reason she and her father were forced to leave damascus she said three thousand christians fled on the same day the young lord shrugged i am not surprised such things happenespecially when the fidain are involved but who are they asked padraig fidain means those whose lives are he searched for the right word forfeitlike a sacrifice sydoni said they held to a hidden faith i put in roupen nodded that is why nobody knows much about them they are very secretive in fact i have heard it said they will kill themselves rather than be taken by an enemy if they die fighting for god they go instantly to paradise at least he shrugged again that is what they believe just then one of the sailors called out that land had been sighted yordanus emerged a short while later and the old trader lurched across the deck to stand squinting in the sunlight and gripping the rail with both hands the three of us joined him and i told yordanus it was good to see him above deck the air will do you good padraig added the old trader gazed across the wide stretch of water at the hazy wrinkle of hills in the blue distance i have not set foot on the mainland since leaving damascus he told us i did not think i ever would again sydoni told me about your troubles i said he turned sad misty eyes to me did she he asked doubtfully then i am amazed he looked away again that is the first time she has spoken of it to anyone twentysix we reached the mainland after dark and stood off shore during the night continuing up along the coast the next morning the sun had but quartered the pale cloudless sky when the pilot sighted the river mouth and as the ship made the short run in padraig and i quickly became very busy with ropes and sails and suchlike when i finally had a chance to look up i saw a wide shallowchannelled estuary opening out into the sea between two steep banks above the river on the high right bank stood the village of marionis its tight clusters of tiny bluedomed houses dazzling white in the bright sun seeing that the ship meant to stop a number of villagers leapt into small boats and rowed out to meet us the first of these enterprising souls now clamoured for our attention yordanus hired two sturdy craft to ferry us to shore and we soon found ourselves standing in the tiny market square haggling over the price of mutton the old trader rose magnificently to the challenge of bartering for supplies truly he relished the cut and thrust of the exchange with a zeal i had rarely seen in anyone half his age he conducted the bargaining in greek and i soon noticed that although he put on a formidable countenance he always settled on a price higher than he might have got if he had pressed a little harder they are farmers and goat herders mostlynot wealthy merchants he said when i asked him about this later life is hard in the villages if i give them a little more they will go home with joy in their hearts and tonight when they pray their prayers will be for me i am a rich man i need all the prayers i can get he smiled his pleasure expanding by the moment besides you never know when you must come back this way again sow a little good will now who knows what you might reap tomorrow eh by midday he had concluded his business and stood with satisfaction before a mound of provisions big round wheels of bread several clay jars filled with salted olives a haunch of fresh mutton slabs of dried meat and fish four live chickens bound in pairs by the feet two bags of flour and jars of oil round pots of soft goat cheese and garlanded strands of onions and bunches of fresh root vegetables of a kind i had never seen before also there was wineno fewer than five large jars bound in baskets woven of dried river reeds at yordanus direction the boys of the village took up the bags and jars and chickens and bread and all the rest and started down to the river padraig and i stood atop the bank and watched as the long line of bearers snaked its way from the village square and down the muddy earth track to the waters edge where the various items were loaded into the two boats yordanus had hired their work completed the old trader gave each boy a piece of silver and they raced back to their homes shouting ecstatically we joined roupen and yordanus by the boats mamistra is two days by river yordanus was saying as we came up maybe three this time of year it has been a long time since i was there a man i know trades horses and pack animals and we will get a good dealif he is still there anazarbus lies ten days beyond that roupen reckoned we will never make it in time since leaving cyprus he had grown increasingly anxious his normally pale aspect was if possible even more pallid and strained i knew he was worried about reaching home to warn his people of bohemonds attack and although we had lived with that threat for many days the distress was finally beginning to tell on him yordanus looked up into the bare brown hills beyond the town and tapped his lower lip with a long forefinger he thought for a moment and said an army can only travel as fast as its footmen we have made a fair start even if they ran all the way they could not overtake us now we will reach anazarbus long before bohemond never fear roupen unconvinced climbed into the boat and sat down eager to commence the journey as soon as possible the rest of the provisions were quickly stowed and we were ready to cast off someone is missing padraig said counting heads where is sydoni she was in the market when we left i recalled and offered to go fetch her i hurried back up the hill to the village passed among the houses and once more into the square she was nowhere to be seen but three of the boys who had helped carry supplies pointed to a house and i saw two old women and three or four young girls standing before the house looking in through the open door i walked over to the house and looked in too and saw a bare room with a freshlyswept floor of beatenearth and a single table against one wall sydoni stood in the centre of the room holding a length of cloth to her body as another woman tucked it up here and there around her meanwhile a third woman perhaps the mother of the first sat at a loom in the corner directing this activity and all three were chattering away at the same time in greek oblivious to all else moving into the doorway i rapped on the doorpost with my knuckles and sydoni looked up saw me and smiled it was a smile of recognition and welcome but also of supreme and unassailable confidencea woman secure in her domain completely at ease allowing me a glimpse of it the provisions are loaded and we are ready to leave i told her in a moment she said and resumed her appraisal of the cloth ignoring me until she had concluded her business she passed the cloth back to the woman who folded it carefully tied it with a length of rag and placed it on a bare shelf high up on the wall then handed sydoni what appeared to be a length of carved willow wrapped in coarse white cloth sydoni then took her leave the two women followed her out of the house and bade her farewell each kissing her on both cheeks we started off across the square and the elder woman called to one of the young girls outside the house who fell in behind us we are to have an escort i said when sydoni did not answer i pointed to the clothwrapped stick what have you there this she said almost absently watch taking the carved end of the slender rod she lightly shook out the cloth to reveal a wooden ring which had been hidden in the folds of the cloth grasping this ring she slid it up along the length of the rod as she did so the most remarkable thing happened the thin cloth blossomed out into a large round disc and stretched itself across a cunning latticework of split cane she fixed the ring somehow and the cloth remained taut what is it i said regarding the strange saillike object sydoni took one look at my astonished expression and laughed out loud the sound was magica warmly female sound full of expression and gaiety gently superior but lacking any hint of scorn or ridicule have you never seen a sunshade she laughed a sunshade i repeated happy to be the fool if it provoked such a delightful sound is that what it is still laughing she asked what do the women of your land use when they travel about nothing i replied then how sydoni demanded in disbelief do they keep the hot sun from wrinkling their skin and making them old before their time so rarely does the sun shine i replied people welcome it rather than hide from it are you saying the sun never shines she looked at me askance i do not believe you truly i insisted when the men and women of scotland see the sun it is a cause for celebration no one would think of shielding themselves from its warmth and light then i hope i never go there she replied emphatically it sounds a dark and dismal place inexplicably her words were like a stab in the heart i felt a sharp pang of regret for having spoken of my homeland in such a way as to invite her disdain how is this sun device employed i asked like this she said raising the slender rod and resting it lightly on her shoulder her face neck and shoulders were now cast into the shadow of the discshaped shade see clever i allowed why not just wear a hat since coming to outremer i had seen many widebrimmed hats made of stripped reed or woven straw they seemed more than able to provide the service of a sunshade peasants wear hats sydoni replied here try it she said handing the thing to me i did as i had seen her do the sight of a foreign man using a sunshade proved too much for our young escort who was promptly seized by a fit of giggles and laughed all the way to the boat i returned the object to sydoni who walked merrily beside me spinning the circle of cloth and humming lightly for the second time in as many days i luxuriated in the unexpected intimacy of her cheerful companionship upon arriving at the boat sydoni informed her father that she had purchased a mantle to be made by one of the women in the village and instructed him to pay the girl who would take the money back to her mother yordanus counted a few silver coins into the girls hand and for the sunshade too she said and he tossed in a few more then under the watchful eyes of the people of marionis we climbed into the boats and began the slow easy voyage up river to mamistra padraig and i shared the rowing chores with the two men from the village relieving them when they began to tire in this way we worked our way along the winding river course we spent the first night on a gravel shingle in the middle of the river with nothing overhead but the starladen sky the second night we camped in a grove of fig trees planted beside the river and as the sun went down on the third day we arrived at mamistra leaving padraig and roupen to help the boatmen unload the boats yordanus and i went into the town early the next morning to search out his horsetrading acquaintance along the way we stopped a farmer with a piglet under his arm and asked him if he knew of anyone thereabouts who raised or traded in horses the farmer squinted his eyes scratched a bristly jaw shifted the piglet from one arm to the other and at last said he might have heard of such a man when yordanus presented him with a silver denarius for his trouble the farmer broke into a wide toothless grin and said that yes he remembered now the man he was thinking of was called nurmal yes the very fellow i was hoping to find where does he live i cannot say answered the farmer if i ever heard where he lived i do not remember now yordanus plucked out two more denarii and placed them in the farmers rough palm does this help your memory no my lord replied the farmer eyeing the silver sadly i still do not know where he lives but i know where you can find him tell me said yordanus and you can keep the silver there is a mill over there the farmer pointed beyond the town to a knoll surmounted by a windmill he buys grain and fodder there on market days hefting his pig he said today is the market we thanked the toothless fellow and sent him on his way rejoicing in his unexpected wealth the mill was further than it first appeared and it took us some time to walk up the long rocky slope only when we got to the top did we see that there was a road leading up from the other side nevertheless we found a goat track and followed it arriving at the mill from behind the miller was a gruff man of few words but more of yordanus silver loosened his tongue and we learned that nurmal had not been there yet but was expected some time during the day i will wait here for nurmal yordanus suggested you go back and tell the others we have found our man nurmal and i will join you at the river i did not like leaving him but as i was walking from the yard the millers wife brought him out a bowl of milk to drink i left him sitting in the shade of the house sipping cool milk and looking like a man for whom the world held no worries padraig and the boatmen had unloaded the provisions under a tree the boats were gone now however and padraig was preparing food on a small fire at the rivers edge sydoni was asleep in the shade of the tree and roupen sat on a rock nearby knees drawn up under his chin and gazing forlornly into the swirling brown water all is well i said settling on the rock beside him we are making fair speed we will reach anazarbus before bohemond and his army you shall see it makes no difference he muttered without looking up there are not enough soldiers in all of armenia to repel the crusaders they will slaughter us like dogs roupen i said after a moment we will do what we can and trust god for the rest i reached out and put my hand on his shoulder to reassure him hope and pray you hope he snarled shoving my hand away you pray i left him to his despair and went to help padraig cook the meal we ate and dozed afterward and the day grew hot the sun soared through a sky bleached white with heat haze and then began its long descent behind the dusty sagecovered hills beyond mamistra padraig and i were just discussing whether we should go back to the mill and look for yordanus when we heard a horse whinny and there coming down along the track leading into the town was the old trader himself on a milk white stallion riding beside another man on a black behind them rode two more men leading two horses each they reined up at the waters edge and while the two men watered the horses yordanus presented nurmal a smiling graceful whitehaired elder with a skin so brown it looked like polished leather he wore the silken robes of an arab potentate and when he spoke his long white moustache quivered with excitement what do you think of my horses asked nurmal when everyone had been properly introduced they are wonderful i remarked in scotland not even kings own such fine horses i am not surprised although they are perhaps more plentiful here allowed nurmal modestly the arabs place a high value on their animals and breed the best in the world yordanus and i have concluded our bargain ad that remains is for you to choose he gestured towards the horses inviting our inspection i will be more than happy with any of them i am sure i replied casually you are too easily pleased he said but that will not do any man who must trust life and limb to his mount would be well advised to take a moments sober reflection over the choice so i stepped closer and subjected the animals to a more thorough inspection they stood on long slender legs their handsome heads high their manes and tails were full and long their necks finely curved and powerful i ran my hands over their glossy coats and i could almost feel the surge of those solid shoulders and the earth speeding effortlessly beneath me in all they were magnificent creatures clearly beyond my own small capacity to judge aside from the colour of their lustrous coats there was not a whiskers difference between them that i could see so i chose a grey with a speckled rump because it made me think of the mist rising over the moors back home the others chose their mounts whereupon nurmal announced now then my friends we are to ride to my home where you will stay tonight you will dine with me and tomorrow we will set off for anazarbus you mean to go with us asked roupen i could tell he thought ill of the idea indeed yes my lord you need a guide and i must look after my horses no nurmals smile was broad and handsome trust this man as you would trust me yordanus said i have already told him of your need for haste and secrecy that is why it is best for you to stay with me tonight rather than in the town nurmal explained roupen frowned unconvinced at least it hurries us on our way i told him and in a better fashion than we have enjoyed so far whatever misgivings he might have had about the arrangements were soon swept aside in the exuberance of mounting such excellent horses spirited intelligent compliant without being dull they were indeed a joy to ride it had been a fair while since i had been on the back of a horse but i know i had never sat astride one half so responsive and wellmannered we struck off along an old road leading up behind the town and into the quiet hills the dusky air was cool and heavy with the scent of broom and sage the sky grew slowly dark and the moon rose we rode along content to remain silent as we passed through the nightdark land climbing higher into the rough empty hills until we came to a large walled villa tucked into the fold of a shallow valley and surrounded by stables and yards we dismounted in the yard and nurmal made us welcome saying tomorrow we embrace the rigours of the trail but tonight his smile was a glint of white in the moonlight we eat and sleep like kings come the table is prepared want for nothing my friends thus we entered a house of such effortless liberality and friendliness that within the space of a simple wholesome meal we each became monarchs of vast domain and rose from the table refreshed and renewed for the journey ahead as we went to our beds padraig confided if hospitality was the saving of men then i have no doubt that when the angels called us to the heavenly banqueting table we would find nurmal of mamistra sitting at gods right hand amen i replied happily with nurmal beside him god could not ask for a more amiable dinner companion twentyseven it was still dark when we left that homely house we stopped at sunrise to take the first drink of a long and thirsty day the night sky grew milky grey then yellow and finally blue even as we watched the pale fingers of sunlight stretch along the valleys and separate the dark mass of rough hills one from another we could feel the heat of the day spreading in waves over the land we mounted up again at once and pushed on so as to get as far as possible along our journey before we were forced to stop and wait for the sun to set as i rode along i thought of all those i had left behind in scotland of my mother and father abbot emlyn and the othersand you dearest gait were foremost among them i knew murdo and ragna were watching over you as well nay better than i would if i had been there still i felt a pang of guilt for leaving you and wished that i might have been a gull or an eagle that i could swoop down and see you and know if only for an instant what you were doing at that moment i held you in my mind and tried to imagine how you might have grown since i had last seen you and then my heart i held you before the throne of grace and asked the high king of heaven to send three angels to surround you and watch over you day and night until i could return yes on that rough road into those ragged dusty sagecovered hills my thoughts turned towards going home and i felt the gnawing agony of what padraig calls the hiraeth the homeyearning i felt it like a sharp clawing ache in my heart as if a rip had opened up in the fabric of my soul and a blast of cold bitter wind rushed through for the first time since leaving caithness i wished i was on the homeward trail it was after midday before we found a place to water and rest through the long hot wait until evening the trees were short and scrubby little thorncovered oaks large enough for one or two to squat beneath the flies liked them too and worried us incessantly but at least the dense leathery leaves kept the sun off our heads we tethered the horses to graze on whatever they might find to nibble and then retreated to the shade i had not spoken to yordanus privately for several days and i had questions on my mind so i joined him as he reclined beneath his tree he welcomed the company and we began to talk there is something i have been wanting to ask you since leaving famagusta i told him an unanswered question is like a toothache that only heals with asking he said turning his face towards me what is vexing you my friend why are you doing this at his puzzled glance i added ships supplies now horsesall this why are you helping us ah well he replied cannot a man help a friend in need forgive me yordanus but there must be more to it than that it came to me then that perhaps i was not the friend he meant it is de bracineaux i suggested he sent us to you knowing you would do this but why what is between the two of you that you should take such personal interest in this affair he sat with his back to the gnarled little bole resting his head against the crinkled black bark and staring out across the narrow brown valley shimmering dully in the heat haze the buzzing of the flies grew loud in the silence i did not press him but let him come to it in his own time at last he drew a long low breath and said in a voice full of mourning and melancholy i am doing it for my son you mentioned him before i said trying to make it easier for the old man to speak i can see you loved him very much julian was his name said nurmal having overheard the beginning of our conversation he had come to join us bringing a water skin and a wooden cup may i please yordanus nodded and patted the ground beside him and nurmal sat down julian was everything a father hopes for in the child who will carry on the family name and lineage yordanus continued pride edging into his voice he was my hope and my joy the old trader went on to describe the unhappy events of their last days in damascus the trouble all began in his estimation with the fall of jerusalem which shocked the seljuqs and saracens beyond all measure overnight all previous certainties collapsed and the world was pitched headlong into unimaginable turmoil out of the chaos new and often dangerous alliances emerged everywhere the rulers and potentates of the old order made the best bargains they could with anyone who offered the barest hope of protection from the burgeoning multitude of dangers perils and threats arising almost daily it was no different in damascus yordanus told me atabeg tughtigin held out as long as he could in his prime he had been an able and fairminded ruler but in the end his age and health began to tell against him he made alliance with the fidain the word pricked my attention and i recalled what sydoni and roupen had told me about this shadowy sect yordanus saw that i recognized the name and said you have heard of them i see sydoni mentioned them she called them murderers and said they held a hidden faith but she did not say what that faith might be they are muslims yordanus explained but of a very strict and overzealous stripe it is their allconsuming desire to unite the muhammedans in a single observance of the muslim faith to do this they are willing to dare all thingseven martyrdom dangerous men i observed murderous nurmal corrected all the more because of the hashish the hashish i had never heard the word before and asked what it might be oh it is a very potent herb that can be used in various ways the fidain eat it or smoke the dried leaves in pipes it is a powerful essence and it makes them foolishly courageous when they are in the grip of the hashish they fear nothing declared nurmal for this reason some call them the hashishin a name they hate it is true affirmed yordanus death holds no terror for them nor the life hereafter they sacrifice all to their faith in the belief that they are instruments of god used to bring about divine justice by murdering their enemies by slaughtering anyone who opposes their schemes yordanus insisted they are everywhere now and everywhere loathed like god they see and hear every deed and every word and like god they hold all men to judgement and their judgement is always the same added nurmal guilty sadly it is so agreed yordanus nodding sagely you said they came to damascus i suggested gently prodding the tale back to its beginning yes and it was the worst evil ever to befall that admirable city they were granted refuge in damascus in return for helping in its defence why old tughtigin ever agreed to this bargain i will never understand no doubt he thought it best to have them inside the tent pissing out rather than the other way i cannot say but as anyone might easily have predicted the decision was disastrous once settled inside the walls the fidain began to worm their way into every corner of the government within a few months they had taken control of the wazirs office and were exerting heavy influence over all state affairs tughtigin became a ghost in his own palace unseen unheard he roamed the corridors moaning and fretting with remorse over his foolishness but the damage was done the fidain would not be moved the people endured as best they could trade was difficult and unimaginably complicated for example if the fidain did not like the colour of the cloth you were selling they declared it unclean confiscated it and imposed a heavy fine on you for selling it if a man stopped in the street to speak to a woman they fined him if a woman ventured outside with her head uncovered she was fined if they found your turban too tall or your beard too short they fined you if you could not pay these fines they threw you in prison in no time at all half the population was walking around with debts they could not pay and the other half was in prison yordanus shook his head ruefully and should you be so unwise as to protest your innocence you simply disappeared sometimes if you were lucky someone might find your head nailed to the city gates otherwise you were never seen again i suppose christians suffered the worst of it i mused so you might think yordanus allowed but no the perpetrators of this disaster were exceedingly equitable oh yes they favoured all citizensrich or poor young or old christian jew or muhammedan with the same infernal impartiality each year it became worse for the merchants and moneylenders no less than everyone else good trade depends not only on a reliable healthy ebb and flow of goods and services but a fair expectation of progress and a modest hope for the future let these springs dry up however and like a river in the desert all trade swiftly disappears nurmal poured water into the cup and passed it to yordanus we endured as best we could for as long as we could he said draining the cup and passing it back in the end it became intolerable is that when you decided to leave i asked if only it were so yordanus murmured julian would still be alive his mouth twitched in a smile of such sorrowful regret that i could not bear to see it and looked away quickly all is vanity he said softly and nothing more so than the heart of man seeing his friend in such distress nurmal quietly moved the conversation onto a less painful subject and i was left with more questions than when we first began as soon as the heat of the day began to fade in the desolate hills we moved on i thought about what yordanus had told me turning the pieces of his tale over in my mind it seemed to me that julian and his sorry fate lay at the heart of the mystery and thinking i would get no more from the father i decided to ask the sister but i did not have a chance to speak to her alone that night nor all the next day indeed it was not until well after dark when we had stopped for the night and everyone else was going to sleep that i was able to get her alone sydoni i said moving close to where she sat by the dying campfire i would speak to you she looked up at me the glow of the embers bathing her face like the rosy light of a faroff dawn sit beside me she said her voice charming and low her long hair was upswept to keep it off her shoulders but small tendrils had escaped and now curled around her ears and along the slender shapely column of her neck i wondered what it would be like to wind one of those curls around my finger i asked your father to tell me about what happened in damascus i said dropping down beside her on the ground and did he she regarded me with the same unnerving directness as the first time we met in the villa courtyard this time however there was less defiance in her glance and more appraisal he told me a little i replied he told me about julian then he told you much she corrected turning back to her contemplation of the embers i asked him why he is helping us and he said he is doing it for his sonfor julian she seemed to consider this and then rejected it no she said thoughtfully whatever the reason it is not julian vanity then i asked it was the last thing her father had said and i hoped she might know what he meant perhaps she allowed you see my father would have been the governor of damascus she glanced sideways at me i see he did not mention that i shook my head no it is true julian did not approve he urged father on numerous occasions to leave the city but yordanus refused to go because he coveted the exalted position he blamed the fidain i pointed out of course she replied as if this was manifestly selfevident none of this would have happened if not for them theywete the ones who wanted him to be governor this made no sense but i thought the fidain were muhammedans i pointed out yordanus said they were ruling the city shh she hushed keep your voice down or youll wake everybody be quiet and i will tell you how it was drawing up her long legs she wrapped her arms around her knees and staring into the embers as into the stillglowing past she began to describe their last days in damascus the atabeg tughtigin the same he was a sick old man and getting weaker all the time the wazir was a vacillating bootlick named almazdaghani who sided with the batinithe fidain by another name the day came when the atabeg could no longer rise from his bed seeing he was about to die tughtigin gave his title to his son buri the amirs were happy to approve the choice because buri had vowed to rid the city of the hated fidain and that sydoni declared emphatically is when our troubles really began she spoke with quiet candour and i found listening to her a pleasure and one i had not experienced in a womans company for a very long time the fidain considered themselves the only true muslims she said and in their eyes buri and the amirs were faithless and unbelieving as tughtigin grew weaker his son took over more and more of his fathers power and began taking steps to eradicate the hated cult this alarmed the fidain who had imagined they might control the new atabeg as they had controlled his father the more buri exerted his growing authority the more the fidain feared losing the only place they had ever been welcomed they soon discovered themselves hunted and harassed at every turn and in desperation went looking for a protector who could ensure their survival in secretthe fidain are masters of secrecythey sent an envoy to edessa at her mention of my uncle torfs former home in outremer sydonis recitation suddenly ceased to resemble a tale of long ago and became immediate and real baldwin i murmured baldwin the second she amended the fidain offered to hand over the city to the count if he would let them have the city of tyre to rule in return what prince could resist such a gift but baldwin was wary he sent word back that if the christians of the city wished his intervention then they must unite behind a leader who could organize the new regime one night they came to our house sydoni shivered at the memory six men dressed in black and wearing the curved swords and crossed daggersthey came asking for yordanus hippolytus saying they had an offer for him to consider julian was not at home or else he would not have let them in but my father did not want any trouble so he agreed to hear them out that is when they told him that the city would soon be handed over to baldwin and that if he agreed to let them leave unhindered he would be made governor to rule the city under baldwin did he agree to this not at first sydoni replied he told them he would pray about it and seek the counsel of the elder christians in the city they gave him four days to think it over and said they would come back for his answer well julian was against it he did not want to have anything to do with the batini but many of my fathers friends urged him to accept the offer they saw it as a chance for the christians to gain back the power they had lost under the muslims still my father hesitated for julian sake he did not like going against julian true enough but he did not think he could trust the fidain to keep their part of the bargain he did not see how he could govern a city where the muslims far outnumbered the christians what changed his mind i asked baldwin sent word that the templars were ready to back him the count promised that he would give damascus a garrison of its own de bracineaux was at edessa then and he was to have been the grand master of the new garrison he came one night and spoke to my father and pledged his support with the templars at his command the governorship would be secure so my father agreed what happened we waited all through the summer but baldwin never came she replied i do not know why he abandoned us i heard it said that he marched out with his army and was only waiting for support from the count of antioch by the time he realized bohemond would not come to his aid the autumn rains had begun baldwin did not care to wage a campaign in the mud and cold so he marched back to edessa when it became clear that baldwin would not attack she told me buri the new atabeg decided the time was right to make his move he gathered some warriors and on the morning the city was to be given over he marched into the pavillion of roses in the palace where the wazir was at prayer he ordered the wazir to be executed then and there they hacked the body to pieces with swords and sent the pieces to be hung on the gate of iron as a warning to anyone who planned rebellion the atabeg decided to expel all the christians so any plot they might have made could not succeed every last christian in the city was informed that they had until sunset to gather their belongings and depart they were allowed to take whatever they could carry with them so long as they left the city before the gates closed the expulsion was total any christians found in the city after dark would be killed they worked like slaves and yordanus hired many of his jewish and muslim friends as well he organized an entire caravan and they loaded whole chests of treasure onto donkeys and horses by sundown they had nearly finished and yordanus commanded julian to begin leading the baggage train out of the city so that it would not be caught when the gates closed the danger was real she said and i believe her all of damascus was in an uproar as never before they started out but julian was fearful of leaving sydoni and yordanus behind so once he got to the gates he left the caravan in charge of the hired men and ran back to the house to bring the rest of the family and servants to safety sydoni licked her lips bracing herself for what came next once julian had departed father changed his mind and abandoned the rest of the packingwhat was the use instead we hurried after julian but the streets were crowded and it was difficult to get through we reached the gates only to find the caravan stopped the hired men scattered and julian nowhere to be seen we searched quickly asking everyone but no one would tell us anything at last we found one of the workmen who said that when julian could not get through he came back and the soldiers at the gate challenged him and demanded a second bribe when julian refused the soldiers seized him and dragged him away threatening the rest of the hired men with violence if they told anyone the man showed us where the soldiers had taken julian and we found his battered body lying in his own blood the soldiers had beat him and left him to bleed to death behind a dung heap her voice trailed off and we sat listening to the soft tick of the dying coals there was nothing we could do she said after a moment julian was dead and by then it was growing dark we had to move on or face death ourselves even so it was only with great difficulty that i persuaded my father to leave we paid the workman to take care of the corpse and made our way to the gate the greedy soldiers had closed it already and refused to open it unless father gave them half his silver and gold in the end they took more than that of course and we were allowed to keep the rest because they were too lazy to unpack the animals it took us nine days to reach tyre on the coast she said her voice cracking slightly with every step of the way my fathers heart hardened against baldwin and the other leaders of the christian principalities that much more de bracineaux helped us to reach cyprushe even sent soldiers to sidon and tripoli to get fathers ships back the merchants there had heard that the christians had been exiled from damascus and they assumed yordanus had been killed but it was julian she turned to me in the soft ember glow unshed tears gleaming her eyes now you know she said i regretted my curiosity had i known it would cause her such pain i never would have asked i am sorry sydoni i murmured feeling her sorrow as a leaden lump in my heart and wishing i might have spared her the anguish of those awful days and their retelling i wanted to put my arm around her shoulders and hold her close but i did not know whether she would welcome such a gesture of comfort from me that was two years ago and i have not spoken of this to anyone since the day we left damascus she said pushing the tears away with the heel of her hand i will not speak of it again nor did i blame her twentyeight eight days we were on the road and in that time met only a handful of fellow travellersa few farmers and shepherds going to or returning from distant markets four greek priests and a company of merchants on their way to seek their fortunes among the armenians these last fell in with us and hoped to keep our company until reaching anazarbus otherwise the journey was forgettable in every way one rockstrewn hillside is much the same as the next after all we slept and ate and rode on growing more fretful and peevish and less companionable as the days wore away yordanus who had begun with such zeal began to fade he was an old man and his strength was not equal to his enthusiasm sydoni seemed to retreat into herself becoming ever more pensive and melancholy i would see her riding with her sun shade spread above her and try to engage her in conversation but the sombre preoccupations of her mind were too potent to quell for very long she soon slipped back into her distracted reflection roupen anxious and tetchy since leaving antioch grew ever more so as his apprehensions mounted no one could say two words to him without either starting an argument or casting him into a desperate frenzy of morbid selfpity only padraig and nurmal remained unaffected by the oppressive samenessnurmal because he loved his horses and found happiness in all circumstances so long as he was sitting in the saddle and padraig because that is the way he is priests of the cele de find hardship stimulating and entertaining in an improving way indeed they have been known to fashion misfortune for themselves when supplies of the natural stuff run short for myself i gradually tired of trying to keep the others cheerful and more often than not found myself deep in brooding meditation on the peculiar twists and turns encountered on lifes rocky roadall the more because each twist and turn took me further from my pursuit of the holy rood the urgency and importance of our purpose notwithstanding i began to resent all the intrusions and irritations large and small which kept me from my quest more and more i grew anxious to be about my own business and longed for the day when there would be no one to defend pamper or appease save myself alone i was heartily glad when on the eighth day we crested a hill and saw the walls of anazarbus glistering in the heatsheen because of the hills we had come close upon the city before seeing it and now there it was nestled like a clutch of dull ruddy eggs in the protective bends of the curved city walls away to the south and east slanted a rough broken plain through which a river had dug a deep ravine to the north and west ranged the tumbling craggy foothills of the high taurus mountains rising elegantly if forbiddingly in the hazy distance once in sight of the city roupen morose and unresponsive at best now became almost drunk with exuberance he lifted his head and gave out a shriek which must have been heard in the streets of the city itself he slapped the reins and urged his good horse to speed the animal glad for an excuse to run after so many days of dull plodding put back its ears reared and leapt to a gallop pulling along the poor pack horse tethered behind following his lead nurmal and i gave our horses their heads and let them run leaving our band of merchants behind it was as if my heart took wings suddenly the grinding monotony of the road fell away as we thundered down towards the city roupen was first to reach the gates and had already dismounted by the time we arrived we joined him as he remonstrated with the guards at the gate to let us in do you not know who it is that demands entrance he said his voice tight with anger his joy quickly quenched by the obstinate refusal of the gatemen to obey it is lord roupen son of prince leo offered nurmal helpfully no one is to enter or leave the city without the lords leave the stolid guard replied the two soldiers with him nodded and edged nearer but that is absurd shouted roupen he made to force his way around the guards who levelled their weapons threateningly wait i said stepping quickly between roupen and the gatemen something is amiss here i told him it is useless arguing with them see if they will agree to take a message to your father roupen was illdisposed to take my advice but saw the sense of it nonetheless turning to the porter he snapped take a message to your master tell him that lord roupen waits outside the city walls and begs to be reunited with his family this caused the guards some consternation the chief among them put out a hand towards the one next to him you heard he said pushing the man away run the soldier scurried off disappearing into the gatehouse behind him i beg your pardon my lord the porter muttered we did not know it was you roupen seemed inclined to take issue with the unhelpful fellow but nurmal intervened save your breath my friend the error is soon put right the walls of anazarbus were curved as i say and protected with squat towers along their length and over the central gate what is more despite the peace and calm of the day soldiers manned the towers and moved along the walls upon pointing this out to nurmal he replied it was the first thing i noticed i think they must be expecting someonebut not us roupen did not hear this as he was pacing back and forth between us and the guards growing more and more peevish over the lack of respect shown him i decided it was best to ignore his ill humour and sat down on a rock beside the road to wait for the others to join us nurmal took up a waterskin drank and passed the skin to me it is warm i fear but until we get something better i drank and then stood took the skin and poured some into my hand and gave it to my mount in this way the thirsty animal finished the little left in the skin and i was about to fetch some more when roupen shouted look my brothers out from the gatehouse strode two men as unlike the young lord as beans from barley where he was slender and frail they were wellmuscled brawny men where he was longlimbed and languid they were stocky broadshouldered and vigorous the only similarity between them that i could see was their thick black haira feature they shared with all armenians at the sight of the young man they both shouted a greeting and roupen ran to meet them the soldiers slightly embarrassed that the strict observance of their duty should have inconvenienced the royal household shrank back looking both repentant and stubborn as the glad reunion commenced in spite of their earlier efforts to prevent it the two men caught the younger and lifted him off his feet in fierce hugs and pounded him on the back until he winced all the while speaking in a tongue as rapid as it was unintelligible they knocked the youth this way and that with the easy abuse of true brothers and it put me in mind of how eirik and i had behaved towards one another when we were younger nurmal and i approached and waited to have our presence recognized presently roupen turned and grinning said my friends i give you my brothers indicating the elder of the two he said this is thoros the man inclined his head politely pointing to the second one he said and this is constantine the man bowed respectfully roupen then introduced me and explained quickly that if not for me he would not be standing there now duncan saved my life he said proudly not once but twice he is a true friend the elder brother thoros stepped before me then and seized my hand in both of his we are much indebted to you sir tonight in your honour we will hold a feast to celebrate our brothers return i accepted his announcement with a modest bow whereupon he turned at once to nurmal here you are nurmal my good friend i should have known you would have something to do with this not at all my lord replied the horsetrader humbly they would have reached anazarbus on raw determination alone i merely helped smooth the way a little to me thoros said did you hear that never believe it there is nothing that happens east of the taurus that does not concern nurmal of mamistra he laughed then but nurmal did not share his patrons jest you exaggerate thoros the horsetrader protested but no matter i am happy to serve however i can the rest of our party reined up then and introductions were made all around padraig was made much of they had never seen a monk who was not dressed in heavy black robes and refused to believe he was a priest yordanus and sydoni also received especial regard and i noticed that thoros lingered over sydonis hand as he welcomed her and her father then with good grace and simple sincerity thoros thanked everyone for taking care of his brother and helping return him to his home god will honour your charity with the praises of angels he said but the noble house of anazarbus will fill your pockets will gold so saying he gathered everyone with a great swoop of his arms as if we were children come now friends let us go in the prince will want to know his lost son has returned at last once inside the thick city walls we were conducted directly to the palace which stood a short distance across a small square directly inside the gates the palace itself was built in the manner of a church and was flanked by two domed towers each surmounted with golden crosses as we walked across the square i observed that there were few people about nor did there seem to be much activity in the surrounding streetsa few children playing an old woman carrying a basket of greens and one or two men pushing carts but not at all what i might have expected from a city the size of anazarbus i was not the only one to notice the absence of the local population nurmal walking easily beside thoros said is everyone in hiding where have the people gone as it happens replied thoros we are under alert seljuq raiding parties have been seen in the hills and it is feared that an attack is imminent the big man cast a hasty glance at me behind him do you mean to say you have seen no sign of them no lord not so much as a single turban between here and mamistra nurmal told him well they are out there the scouts say the hills are crawling with them you are lucky you did not run headlong into amir ghazi himself ghazi is it mused the horsetrader why is the old devil sniffing around here did you forget to pay your tribute thoros laughed heartily and said we have had other things on our minds lately they continued talking in this way but my attention shifted to what constantine and roupen were saying behind me what is the matter with him roupen asked although he spoke softly i caught the concern in his tone he is not well his brother replied the physicians have done what they can but no one knows what ails him how long four months answered constantine maybe a little longer there is not much hope any morestill he lingers the old warrior fights on the young man paused then added he will be glad to know that you are home at last what happened to everyone else we were stricken with ague the moment we set foot in frankland i escaped but fever took all the rest it bodes fair to take the prince as well observed constantine gloomily thus i pieced together what had caused the closure of the royal city prince leo was gravely ill and the tribute paid to the muhammedans had been allowed to lapse consequently their seljuq overlords were angry those who should have been their allies and protectors were massing in the hills gathering the necessary strength to attack and the armenians soon to be forcibly reminded why they paid the tribute in the first place were about to receive the unhappy news that bohemond iis army was on its way although not as large or as opulent as the citadel at antioch the palace of the armenian princes was grand without being extravagant while they obviously shared the same lofty ambitions of all noble families they at least showed some restraint in the furnishing of the royal residence or perhaps their means were not as extensive as some then again they may have had better things to do with their wealth than spend it on overlavish possessions be that as it may i found the simplicity of my surroundings refreshing the walls of the chamber padraig and i were to share for example were painted the deep ruby colour of red wine below a ceiling of dark blue in which small golden discs had been affixed no trouble had been taken to hide the rooftrees above indeed these were painted green when i lay down that night by candlelight it was as if i looked up through the clustered boughs of a forest into the night sky agleam with stars but that was yet to come for no sooner were we conducted to our room than the princes chamberlain appeared to inform us that lord thoros was awaiting us in his receiving chamber we splashed water on our faces and brushed the dust of the road from our hair and clothes and then followed the servant you must tell him about bohemonds attack as soon as possible padraig reminded me they will need time to prepare of course i agreed at once the monk insisted i will i will we were led through the inner corridors of the palace to a cozy reception chamber somewhere behind the main hall thoros was there alone standing at a table mixing wine with water come in come in cried thoros pouring the wine into two large goldrimmed silver bowls i thought a drink might ease the fatigue of the journey he said raising a bowl in each of his hands and extending them to padraig and myself after observing the proper greeting and welcome ritualswhich he conducted in the armenian tonguehe invited us to sit with him with pleasure my lord i replied i wanted a word with you before the feast as we stepped into the room nurmal appeared behind us sit with us my friend we were just about to share the welcome cup nothing would delight me more my friend replied nurmal his white moustache bristling with delight it has been far too long since we sat together not long enough for me to forget that i owe you a great deal of money replied thoros he shook his head ruefully i do not need to tell you it has been very difficult here these last two years sorrow dragged down the corners of his mouth as he gazed forlornly into the cup between his huge hands the harvest trade nonsense scoffed nurmal goodnaturedly you have had fine harvests nay bounteous harvests magnificent harvests three years running and trade has never been better the coffers of armenia are bursting caught in his small lie thoros made a shamefaced grin and looked at me from under his heavy brows you see i told you nothing happened east of the taurus he does not know i did not come here to embarrass you into paying me nurmal told him yet if it would ease your conscience to lighten the load i would of course accept any amount you would care to bestow in recognition of our longforgotten bargain ha cried thoros slapping the table with his hand you are a fine fellow nurmal so i have always said never fear you will not leave anazarbus emptyhanded lord thoros i decided was like a great shaggy bear at once fierce and childlike there was nothing of subtlety or guile in his open features or wide dark eyes his loyalties could be easily discerned by the expression on his face yordanus hippolytus appeared at my door in the company of these good men nurmal volunteered he said he had urgent business in anazarbus and required horses for himself and his friends once i discovered why he needed my horses what else could i do but see them safely to their destination protecting your investment said thoros wagging his finger knowingly i know you i will not deny it said nurmal but there is more setting aside his bowl he looked to me tell him duncan he said his voice taking on a solemn tone thoros sipped his wine and regarded padraig and me benignly yes whatever you have to say tell it to thoros i am in a mood to hear the news of the world i needed no urging from padraig silent or otherwise to speak the message we had all travelled so far and at such great expense to deliver my lord the news i bring is not good i began and went on to describe how i had learned of prince bohemonds desire to restore the county of antioch to the boundaries established by his father he is on his way here now with his army i concluded and means to take the city thoros received the news remarkably well i know this already thoros said blithely pouring more wine into the bowls roupen has told me of course he is known of times to become somewhat overwrought shall we say i am happy to have you confirm that this is nof the case he smiled as if to dismiss the report as an illfounded and fairly disreputable rumour it is a fact padraig said speaking up lord duncan and i heard it from the lips of bohemond himself we called upon him to repent of his plan before god the priests assertion seemed to impress thoros who inquired how this had come to be so i explained about meeting the templar renaud and how he had given roupen padraig and myself passage aboard his ship commander renaud told me about the princes planalthough it was by no means a secret bohemond had been raising troops for this purpose all summer but he would not listen to you thoros suggested with a sympathetic shake of the head they rarely do these franks if these tidings for which we had endured considerable hardship caused him the least concern he hid his distress admirably well we failed to persuade him and had to flee antioch i told him we came here as quickly as we could to warn you i expect bohemond wasted no time in gathering his troops it is entirely possible that he is only a few days march from here even now nurmal nodded gravely padraig frowned gazing at the serenely untroubled nobleman as if at a riddle that might be solved by staring long and hard lord roupen will no doubt confirm all we have told the monk said watching our host for any sign of dismay or alarm thoros nodded sympathetically you have risked your lives to help my brother and bring this warning to us for this you shall be rewarded what is more i shall order prayers to be sung in your honour tonight my lord is too kind i replied fighting down a sudden and overwhelming feeling of foolishness we did not come here in anticipation of any reward i told him stiffly indeed we will be more than satisfied to continue on our way as soon as possible i will not hear of it replied thoros amiably you have travelled a very great distance you must rest and take your ease allow us to show you the generosity of the noble armenian race he put aside the bowl and rose please remain here and refresh yourselves as long as you like tonight you will sit with me at the feast speaking of which i have remembered something i must do i ask you to excuse me he bade us farewell and strolled from the room you should feel proud said nurmal you have done well the armenians are a generous people and will certainly reward you handsomely we have done only what anyone might do i replied still struggling to shake the feeling that for all his thanks and praise thoros cared more about his wine than the calamity looming over his city the fate of his people swung in the balance and his concern was arranging feasts moments ago my chief desire was to see bohemond and the rulers of armenia reconciled and for peace to reign between the two houses now i could think only of leaving the doomed city of anazarbus before the upstart bohemond arrived and reduced it to smouldering bricks and ash twentynine padraig and i returned to our room i was tired and wanted to rest before the festivities began i lay down and slept soundly until i was roused by a servant sent by roupen with fresh clothes for us to wear for the evenings celebration the young fellow did not speak latin but indicated that we were to take the clothes and give him our old ones to be i thought cleaned and mended by the time we had worked this out and washed and dressed roupen was waiting to escort us to the banqueting hall i suppose you will be leaving soon he said as we walked across the inner courtyard owing to the nearness of the mountainswhose sunflamed peaks could be seen rising above the palace roof the evening air was cool the play of light and air put me in mind of a summer night at home in caithness before the memory could result in melancholy i pushed it firmly from me and reminded myself of my vow now long deferred as soon as may be i replied i no longer cared about anything but returning to the pilgrim trail and resuming my abandoned quest tomorrow you must allow my family to honour you sufficiently chided roupen after all you two saved the prodigal son and have proven yourselves allies of the armenian kingdom it would be ungracious to refuse the homage of my people i meant no disrespect i only thought peace my friend roupen replied lightly i had never seen him so calm and selfcomposed i spoke in jest of course you will be allowed to leave whenever you like but let us speak of all that later tonight by prince leos decree you are to be lauded and praised in the ancient manner how is your father asked padraig have you seen him he is very ill roupen answered but my return has cheered him greatly and he asked to see me as soon as they told him i was home although we talked only for a moment my mother says he looked in better health than she has seen him for many weeks the royal physicians are hopeful that he is showing signs of recovery good i am happy to hear it god willing my father will be able to thank you himself before you both rush away we told thoros about bohemonds plan to attack anazarbus i said he appeared to take the prospect with astonishing tranquillity i do not think i could be so placid in the face of the impending destruction of my home and people that is his way roupen replied thoros rarely reveals his true disposition to anyone no one ever knows what he is thinking we reached the entrance to the feast hall then the doors were flung wide and we were met by the royal steward who bowed low and in a loud voice announced to the assembled guests and family members that lord roupen and his friends had arrived we paused to receive the adulation of the gathering and were then led through the noisy throng our ears ringing with enthusiastic shouts many of the courtiers reached out to clap us on the back my arms and shoulders were joyfully slapped and pummelled until the flesh stung and i feared my bones would crack padraig and i were brought to the high banquet table where a combed shaved and freshly arrayed yordanus was talking to an illatease constantine sydoni immaculate in a thin summer gown of shimmering green silk was listening to a greyhaired woman with sad dark eyes at our approach the older woman held out her arms to roupen who kissed and embraced her and then declared lord duncan brother padraig i present my mother princess elena i bowed dutifully she offered her hand and i kissed it padraig likewise whereupon she said words do not exist to express a mothers gratitude for the return of her lost son her latin was very formal and slightly stilted yet perhaps you will allow this token to adorn the hair of a lady you love that when you see it you will be reminded of one whose prayers you helped to answer so saying she reached behind and retrieved from the table two small wooden boxes she gave one to padraig and placed the other in my nand and bade me to open it inside was a brooch and pin of gold the brooch was made of a single large bloodred ruby surrounded by a ring of tiny blue sapphires which glittered with frozen starlight the ruby was carved with a curious symbolwhat appeared to be an orb borne between the wings of an eagle the orb was surmounted by the greek letter chi forming a cross in the shape of an x padraig had received a band of gold the ends of which were shaped like two birds headsstorks or swans i thinkand between their beaks they clutched a glowing emerald for size and lustre the gems were the largest and most brilliant i had ever seen my mother gave these to me and i wore them on my wedding day i do not know if priests in your homeland are allowed to marry i am told that some do not but i hope you will keep these gifts for the woman who bears you a son as kind and loving as my roupen nothing would give me greater pleasure my lady padraig said and thanked her with a blessing in gaelic and you lord duncan she said tapping the box in my hand with her finger do you have a wife alas no lady elena i answered simply i did not care to disturb the memory of your blessed mother gait one day perhaps god willing sydoni standing behind princess elena caught my glance as i said this her look of frank appraisal was disconcerting in its intensity then i will pray the woman you choose will wear it always in love and happiness elena said pointing to the symbol carved on the ruby she said it is the seal of the royal house of armenia our emblem for a thousand years your gift is overwhelming and i thank you but it is too much i demurred withdrawing from sydonis glance with more difficulty than i would have imagined possible i merely accompanied your son along his way the noble womans expression became condescending come now false modesty is as unbecoming as arrogance roupen has told me how you twice saved his life and have been his guardian angel every step of the way i saw that it would do no good to protest further so i bowed again and with burning cheeks accepted my gift as graciously as i could to my relief a servingboy arrived bearing a silver tray with wine in small glass beakers constantine took the tray and distributed the cups to our little gathering taking up one himself he said let us drink to safe journeys and glad homecomings we raised our cups and drank the wine was sweet and good and as we drank and talked i felt myself begin to grow more easy in my manner every now and then one of the other guests would come to the high table to be introduced to padraig and me and make our acquaintance most often roupen did the honours when a name or face failed him constantine or lady elena obliged at first i tried to remember all the names and faces but there were too many and not only did they all look alike to me they seemed to be related to one another in extremely complicated ways so that after awhile it was impossible to tell one from the other more people were coming into the hall and the sound of the crowd soon made speech all but impossible so i stood uneasily beside roupen and his mother holding my cup and gazing out upon the milling throng just when i thought the hall could hold no more the doors were closedwhich made the sound inside even more deafening there was a movement in the crowd and thoros suddenly appeared pushing his way through nurmal followed in his wake they proceeded directly to the high table and greeted the princess and other members of the royal party waiting there as they moved from person to person i noticed that both men were already well into the celebratory spirit they laughed loudly kissing everyone and clapping them on the back their gestures grandiose and exaggerated in short they looked for all the world like men who have just won a fortune on a wager or sailors with silver in their fists who have come into port after a long sea voyage i was not the only one to observe their ebullient behaviour the roisterers emerge from their cups at last remarked constantine he leaned close and all but shouted in my ear now the festivity can begin for the rest of us this might easily have been the casetoo much drink in overeager celebration makes a man giddy god knowsand i might have agreed except for the fact that padraig and i had been with them before the feast and knew that the drinking had been curtailed nurmal like myself had returned to his room and thoros had quit the hall before us certainly the two might have met again and resumed their drinking but i doubted this the dull sense of dread spreading through melike dark wine tinting clear watertold me the explanation was never so benign thoros took his seat at the high table indicating that i should sit at his right hand and padraig at his left nurmal sat beside me and the other members of the royal party assumed their places around the board and the instant they were seated the entire hall convulsed in a tumultuous commotion as the guests scrambled for places at the other tables there were far more people than places and many were forced to stand around the perimeter of the great room looking on and awaiting their chance to claim a place when someone else finished as soon as the hall quieted an old man dressed in long black robes advanced slowly to the high table and in a loud voice called the gathering to prayer clasping his hands he raised them before his face and in ornately antique greek proceeded to entreat the almighty to bless the realm and the faithful of his flock my greek is not so good as my latin as i say but i caught most of it he prayed for the souls of all gathered within the hall and prayed for the continuance of divine guidance and protection he prayed long often wandering from greek into the obscure armenian tongue when he finished the doors of the hall were once again thrown open and servingmen appeared bearing platters of food the first platters were placed on the high tablehuge joints of roast oxen and boarand instantly the aroma brought the water to my mouth and made me realize how hungry i was thoros acting as lord of the feast thrust his hand into the mounded victuals before him and wrested a gobbet from the mass eat he called expansively eat everyone eat enjoy each hungry guest reached for what was before him and soon the juices were running down our chins and hands as we devoured the succulent meat my cup filled itself mysteriously and bread likewise materialized in my hands i took no notice of who or what caused this to happen giving myself entirely to the food which was excellent in every way indeed i was so preoccupied that i did not at first mark the appearance of the blackrobed man at thoros shoulder i slowly became aware of the fact that he was speaking earnestly his demeanour grave and soberin sharp contrast to the redfaced laughing man seated beneath him he loomed over thoros a dark and threatening eminence breathing gloom with every word i watched as all signs of mirth slowly drained from lord thoros face to be replaced by an expression so wretched and doleful as to stop the laughter in the mouths of all who beheld him one by one those at the high table also became aware of the swift alteration in thoros jovial mood and the table fell silent whatever is the matter with you asked constantine his voice loud in the sudden hush thoros looked at his brother and then swung his eyes to his mother seated beside him he placed his hands flat on the table and pushed himself upright with it seemed to me an enormous effort he stood there towering over the feast and in a deep hollow voice announced patriarch baramistos has just informed me that my father prince leo is dead thirty prince leos death immediately plunged all the members of the royal family into a multitude of tedious and timeconsuming rituals and formalities the foreign visitors were quickly forgotten padraig and i gladly fended for ourselves lest we become a burden to our hosts in their time of distress anxious as i was to depart i would gladly have left the city right then and there but in deference to roupens feelings could not bring myself to just sneak away like a thief in the night thus as we had nothing else to do we took the opportunity to wander around the streets of anazarbus and see for ourselves how the passing of the noble ruler was marked by the populace what i saw was a city sunk in grief over the loss of their muchloved prince apparently leo had governed his people wisely and well for many years and the armenians were genuinely sorry he was gone everywhere men and women went about their chores with the mournful countenances of the truly sorrowful speaking in pensive tones scores of small shrines sprang up in the streetshere a painting of the prince there a carving or perhaps simply a coin on which leos image had been stampedand each adorned with a palm frond or bit of green foliage and a candle or lamp whenever anyone passed one of these makeshift shrines he made the sign of the cross on his forehead many of the older men and women wore ashes in their hair and on their garments some donned sacking cloth as well everyone observed the great princes passing in a seemly way and even the younger folk adopted a dutifully subdued and melancholy air if ever an entire city grieved anazarbus was that place the prince himself lay in a gilded casket in the church of saint george and saint nicholas the principle church of the city serving as the cathedral for the armenian observance a large but not imposing building of red stone it was spare and plain without much in the way of fussy adornmentmuch like the chapels the cele de build all morning long padraig and i strolled about the city marvelling at the long lines of mourners snaking across the square and into the surrounding streets as the people streamed in and out of the church where leos body lay every now and then one of the grieving throng would suddenly throw his hands towards heaven and let out a heartfelt wailing cry otherwise the crowds were quiet and respectful the monk was keenly fascinated to see how the armenians conducted their religious services and was enthralled by the endless ritual for myself however the sorrowing crowds and religious feeling seemed wrong or at least inappropriate for a city and nation teetering on the precipice of war immersed in mourning thoros appeared to have given no further thought to either the seljuqs lurking in the hills nor the looming danger of attack by bohemond and his knights the beloved prince leos death swept all else aside certainly beyond the posting of a few more soldiers on the walls there was no other preparation that i could see this amazed and troubled me greatly why had we risked life and limb to bring a warning that was to remain unheeded if the rulers of armenia did not care about their city and the lives of their people why should we disturbed and distraught i turned from the gate and started back to the palace resolved to wait no longer we would leave at once i reached the palace forecourt just in time to witness the arrival of a sizeable contingent of seljuqs i watched from the inner palace yard as the turks were conducted with great ceremony into the hall which had been hastily prepared to receive mourners prince leos funeral was to begin at dusk and the various services rituals and observances would continue through the night culminating with the burial which would take place at dawn the next morning i stood in the shadows and watched as the seljuq emissaries were met by a delegation of armenian nobles and immediately led into the hall where thoros his mother and other members of the royal family were holding court the extreme civility of their welcome did astonish me and i must have worn my amazement on my face for nurmal enjoying the fresh air and quiet of the pleasant courtyard approached took one look at me and said what and have you never seen a seljuq before never i replied in truth i cannot decide which i find the more incrediblethat they should wish to honour the prince in this way or that an avowed enemy should be allowed inside the walls to pay their respects to the mourning family nurmal chuckled i do not know what it is like in your country my friend but here our hostilities are not carved in stone our enmities are more fluidlike streams in the desert continually shifting and changing the enemy you meet today might be the friend you call upon tomorrow you must remember that he was speaking a simple truth of the east and one i had not yet fully grasped even so i heard in the words a foreboding that chilled me to the marrow i thought if enmities are so loosely held then loyalties are likewise inconstant only yesterday the city was in a state of alarm lest the dreaded seljuq attack at any moment i pointed out true nurmal agreed cheerfully but that was then things have changed what hope would there be for anyone if nothing ever changed with nurmals words rolling around in my head i hurried off to find yordanus and sydoni neither one of whom had i seen since the banquet the night before i went to the small dining chamber where thoros had served us wine before the banquet and there found roupen with his brother constantine they were speaking so earnestly to one another that i thought it best not to intrude nevertheless i could not help overhearing a very dangerous business constantine was saying even thoros must see that if he does not he is not fit to rule in fathers place i swear to you i came into roupens view just then and they ceased their conversation at oncealmost guiltily as it seemed to me my friend called roupen you must forgive us for neglecting you the demands of royalty are especially onerous at times like this i understand completely i replied assuring them there was no need to trouble themselves on my account they hesitated then anxious to conclude their conversation so i said please excuse me i am looking for yordanus we have not seen him replied constantine bluntly no doubt he is still in his chamber come to the hall at midday roupen suggested with a tight smile and you will be included in the royal party i will look for you then i thanked them and moved off aware of constantines pentup fury although it was none of my affair i could not help wondering what lay behind his agitation putting it out of my mind i found my way to the wing of the palace where yordanus and sydoni had been given rooms the old trader was sitting in a chair gazing out the open window over the rooftops of the low buildings surrounding the palace i greeted him and not wishing to waste time explained my deep misgivings over the utter lack of preparation to meet bohemonds army i told him that padraig and i were leaving anazarbus and in light of the fact that the city was largely undefended against the imminent attack suggested that he and his daughter should seriously consider doing the same of course i said we will be happy to escort you and sydoni to mamistra he nodded gravely when as soon as i can arrange horses and provisionsno later than midday go then i will tell sydoni come to the stables as soon as you are ready next i hastened to speak to the hostlers about making ready five of nurmals horses i had it in mind that if nurmal was agreeable we might return the horses to mamistra for him if need be i would buy them the brooch princess elena had given me would no doubt purchase a half dozen of his best on the way i found padraig and told him to hurry and secure enough provisions to see us on our way get roupen to help you he owes us that much i guess so saying i continued on to the stables but could find no one who spoke latin and with my poor greek it took longer than i had hoped to make them understand what i wanted i succeeded at last and then rushed back to the palace to gather my things and take leave of roupen nurmal was in his chamber across the corridor from ours he was lying on his bed resting before the evenings ceremonies i quickly told him my plan and begged the use of his horses to return to mamistra of course my friend he said it was always understood that we would return sooner or later go and with my blessing but he added if you do not mind my asking why are you in such a hurry half the day is almost gone and you cannot get far before nightfall why not wait until tomorrow better still stay a few more days and we will all return together there is a battle coming whether anyone in anazarbus believes it or cares i told him i wanted no part of it that greedy prince bohemonds boundary squabble was none of my affair so far as i was concerned i had done my duty by roupen and his people now it was for them to do what they would as for myself and padraig we would wait no longer we were leaving the city at once nurmal regarded me with an amused expression there is no hurry my friend he said we can leave whenever we wish bohemond and his army could be here at any moment i snapped unable to keep the growing frustration out of my voice he is coming with hundreds of mounted knights and a few thousand footmen i have no wish to be trapped in a city under siege much less help defend one calm yourself nurmal said bohemond will never even see the city walls the way he said itwith such careless confidencesent a warning tingle through me i stared at him why what do you know of this amir ghazi will deal with them he said pushing himself up on an elbow and he has many thousand warriorsall of them mounted all of them eager to die for the glory of islam and a martyrs paradise i stared at him trying to make sense of what he was saying the seljuqs why would they intervene we have a saying nurmal replied easily my enemys enemy is my friend thoros understands this better than most he owes amir ghazi a very great sum of money how better to repay his heavy debt than to offer ghazi the particular honour of shall we say delivering prince bohemond and his men into seljuq hands he smiled placidly it is a perfect solution anazarbus is spared the invader is defeated and ghazi receives the irresistible opportunity to recapture antioch harmony and balance is restored but this is monstrous i protested stunned by the duplicity of the bargain the canny horsetrader shook his head no it is simple expedience my friend if i had imagined such deceit i would never have left antioch i declared shaking with fury this is intolerable unthinkable it must be stopped nurmal frowned with benign pity peace duncan you will do yourself an injury he rose from the bed and put his hands on my shoulders in a gesture of fatherly advice while i admire your sense of honour i do not understand your scruples why did you come here i did not understand what he was asking you know as well as anyone why we came here you came to warn the armenians of bohemonds attack nurmal said is this not so yes but what did you think would happen i did not think i began and faltered realizing how i had been used my warning has been turned to treachery i have been made a traitor why speak of treachery nurmal demanded beginning to lose patience with me where is the betrayal where is the treason listen to me my friend there is no betrayal there is only fate and the capricious accidents of war you learned of the coming attack and flew to prevent a slaughter yes for the love of god i only thought to prevent it well you have succeeded it is prevented amir ghazi will see to that never fear the slaughter is not prevented i growled my spirit writhing with guilt it is merely diverted futility and shame descended in heavy waves upon me i turned on my heel and fled the room he called after me but i made no reply i quickly retrieved my belongings there was nothing much to gather my clothes had been taken away for cleaning and had not been returned very well i would escape in what i was wearing i decided and leave all else behind i had half a mind to leave the jewelled bauble princess elena had given me wanted nothing from the armenians but practicality got the better of that decision we would need money if we were to reach antioch in good time and the brooch was very valuable so i took it from its box and pinned it to the inside of my mantle next to my skin where it would be safe padraig was waiting with roupen in the stables the young lord was unhappy to see us leaving with such unseemly haste i wish it could be otherwise i told him he asked me to reconsider but i declined seeing there was no changing my mind he gave in with good grace and told me how much he valued our friendship and that he would pray we concluded our pilgrimage safely yordanus and sydoni appeared in the doorway then and roupen went to bid them farewell and to thank them for their inestimable help in getting him home in time to see his father before he died while they talked padraig and i examined the horses and the packs of provisions satisfied that all was in order we led the beasts out into the yard and bade roupen a last farewell we rode through the gates and out onto the road by which we had come leaving anazarbus behind the sun was high onto midday the weather was fine and bright and hot and we made fair speed with nurmals splendid horses i had chosen the same mounts we had ridden before so they would know us the speckled grey for me the roan for padraig and the two chestnut mares for sydoni and yordanus when the city was no longer in sight we paused briefly for water and then rode on at a slightly less frantic pace once in the saddle again i felt slightly less apprehensive whatever happened i thought it was no longer any of my concern i had done what i could and my help had been twisted and perverted in its use i desired no part of anything so nefarious and was heartily glad not to have to stay another night in that haven of treachery now at this remove gait i can but marvel at the innocence of my thoughts and emotions on that day nurmal spoke the cold heart of the matter and he spoke the truth bohemond had chosen his course long before he reached anazarbus he had committed his life and the lives of his men to his witless plan why did i imagine anything i might do or say could have changed anything did i really think i could sway the balance of heavenly justice who was i after all but an ignorant meddler in matters too far above me to even contemplate how in the name of all that is holy did i hope to prevent that arrogant young prince reaping the harvest of his insatiable ambition and why oh why did i even try the answer i think is that i could not in good conscience abide the thought of christians making war on their christian brothers of believers pursuing the hateful waste of gods precious gift of life for the most frivolous and imbecilic of reasons blind and arbitrary fortune had placed me in a position to know certain thingsthe movements of armies the intentions of rulersand i had somehow concocted the belief that this knowledge brought with it an obligation to use it wisely and for good this is emotion as i say not reason if i had stopped even for a moment and reflected on the matter i would have seen grim futility looming starkly before me if only i had asked myself one simple question what did i want now after endless months of sober reflection i have come to the conclusion that what i wanted was simply for everyone to sit down across the table and work out their differences in a sane and sensible manner i believed that fellow christians frank and armenian could be united against the common seljuq enemy in short i wanted peace to prevail and saw no just reason why it should not i believed that one man of good will could make a difference and that god would honour those who strove to honour him in the madness that passes for sanity in the east this belief was pure delusion an infinitely sadder and wiser man understands that now on that fateful day however i raced from the city eager to distance myself from the insidious deceit of the place and for padraig and me to resume our pilgrimage i pressed a swift pace along the rough uneven road my heart burning within me wishing i had never heard of ghazi thoros or bohemond these thoughts were still in my mind a little while later when as we crested a steep hill i saw the land fall away and spread out beneath us in a steeplyangled plain the plain was a rolling rockandthorn thicket wilderness between the rough foothills of the mountains to the north and the raised cliffs of a deepchasmed dry river to the south even as i took this in i pulled on the reins to halt for there where the road passed through the centre of the plain i saw the sprawling mass of what remained of proud bohemonds army thirtyone christ have mercy sydoni gasped padraig began praying aloud in gaelic and yordanus croaked an incoherent oath across the valley far below a small brave knot of crusaders were yet fighting for their lives all but lost amidst the swirling howling seljuqs the christian commanders were desperately trying to form the battle line the few mounted knights had grouped themselves into a wedgeshaped complement in the vain hope of blunting the attacka hopeless attempt like trying to divide a sea wave with the edge of an oar every time the crusaders made to engage the enemy the swift seljuqs melted away only to assail the exposed flanks when the crusaders turned to protect the flanks the arabs drove in upon them from the front indeed the ceaseless swirling and diving looked like restless waves and the clash of battle sounded like a distant storm far out on the ocean the flat floor of the valley formed a narrow plain between the deeplyeroded ravine of a dry riverbed to the west and ragged barren hills to the east along this plain the rest of bohemonds army lay scattered fallen still from the long spreading swathe of corpses i could tell that they had marched up through the valley and into the ambush ghazi had prepared for them pinched between the ravine on one side and the hills on the other the hapless crusaders had been cut down as they tried to flee back the way they had come not that there could have been any escape the barren slopes were covered with mounted seljuqs from one end of the valley to the other some in dark turbans and some in white red yellow or brown so that they seemed a strangelymottled sea they surged onto the plain in a great inundating flood my heart writhed within me to see the last of the poor doomed franks throwing down their weapons to lend speed to their flight as the merciless seljuqs swooped to the kill i could smell the rich fetid scent of blood on the breeze once as a boy i stood on a rock above one of my fathers barley fields and watched the low black clouds of a sudden summer storm sweep across the land the wind struck first flattening the tall grain with breathtaking violence and then before the golden stalks could rise from beneath the initial onslaught fierce winddriven rain and ripping hail drove the overpowered grain into the ground and battered it to shreds what i had witnessed as a boy i saw again now and a more terrible harvest could not be imagined even from the safe distance of the hilltop i could see the fearsome gleam of the awful arab swords as they slashed and slashed and slashed again like fearful hail falling from on high to pound bohemonds army into the ground never to rise again remorse futility and anger struggled within me i did not want to see the final slaughter come i said wheeling my horse and moving back up the slope as i turned from the sight i caught the glint of gold on the edge of my vision looked and saw bohemonds golden banner gleaming in the hard midday light and then it was gone it simply vanished a fragile light swallowed by the darkturbaned sea raging all around it there was but a momentary ripple in the tide the treacherous flood eddied and swirled overcame and then flowed swiftly on but wait suddenly the banner appeared again streaking across the plainin the hands of a seljuq warrior this time the enemy rider sped away with the prize waving it on high and screaming like the very devil we could hear him from the hilltop and long after his shouts still echoed in my ears as we left the killing ground behind us i raised my eyes towards heaven and prayed for the souls of those poor ignorant soldiers led blindly to the slaughter by the unfettered ambition of their overweening lord i asked the great judge not to hold the stupidity and greed of their leaders against them demonstrate your immeasurable mercy blessed redeemer i prayed and give these unfortunates places in paradiseif not in heavens highest halls then in the surrounding tents at least we left the battlefield behind and after a short ride halted to decide what to do it seemed to me that our best passage lay on the far side of the dry river well away from the battlefield it would take us far out of our way but keep us well out of sight once beyond the battleground we could rejoin the road and continue on padraig and yordanus agreed there are goat tracks all through these hills yordanus said if we keep the river between us and the valley we will soon be well away from the fighting accordingly i chose a goat track that ran along the back side of the hill out of sight of the conflict and led the way sydoni came next then yordanus and padraig last leading the pack horse we followed the path a goodly way when it branched off i took the new one always keeping the line of shielding hills to my right at one point the track descended towards the dry riverbed turning in its descent and passing between two broad outcroppings of broken stone much rock had fallen onto the narrow trail from the steep banks on either side thus making the pass very difficult it took us some time to pick our way through the jagged stones and when at last we emerged out onto the dry bed of the river we paused for a short rest and a drink we dismounted in the shade of the overhanging rocks and padraig fetched a waterskin from the pack horse and we passed it among us each taking a mouthful or two it was cooler in the shade and it was a shame to move on but we had a long way to go to rejoin the road and wanted to be well away from the battlefield by nightfall so we climbed into our saddles and moved on the dry stream bed was flat and wide and sufficiently low to allow us to ride without being seen from the hills where the battle was taking place i pointed this out to yordanus who also thought this would be an easier way to go at least for a short distancefor although rocky along the slopes leading to the banks rising steep on either side at its narrowest the bed was fine sand and still wide enough for two to ride abreast sydoni came up beside me as we rode along and we soon fell into conversation we talked about trifling things nothing of any significance or substance i think she just wanted to put the massacre out of her mind and i was happy to oblige truth be told i enjoyed sydonis company on those few occasions she chose to share it with me i soon found myself profoundly engrossed sydonis way of expressing herself was unique and i thought refreshing i decided it was her coptic blood and her upbringing in damascus among muhammedans that made her unlike anyone i had ever known be that as it may i was paying more attention to her than to the track ahead peacocks are my favourite she was saying especially when they fly their tails are so long and graceful people eat them in damascus but i think they are too beautiful it would be like eating a sunset what do they taste like i asked glancing at her face she hesitated and i saw her eyes go wide the words died on her tongue i looked where she was gazing and saw a party of seljuq warriors appear around a bend a few hundred paces ahead they saw us at the same moment there were six of them each in a bloodred turban black shirts and trousers and short black cloaks they were mounted on identical black arabian steeds and each carried a small round shield covered in white horsehide and bearing a sharpened spike in the centre boss the leader of the group had a single white plume atop his turban he regarded us with bold severity for a moment and i held my breath merciful god cover us with your mighty hand i prayed then turning to the two warriors on his left he spoke a rapid command extending his hand towards us as he did so and my heart lurched in my breast fly i cried jerking hard on the reins the grey responded without so much as a quiver of hesitation and we were away the horses leapt into full racing stride effortlessly and with such swiftness i muttered a heartfelt prayer of thanks to god that nurmal traded in only the finest animals padraig released the pack horse and led the way with yordanus right behind sydoni and i were last but only by the length of a tail i slapped the reins across the noble greys shoulders and let the horse run feeling the powerful muscles bunch and flow beneath me as we fled back along the dry stream the horses hooves biting deep into the sandy path and flinging grit skyward in no time at all we reached the bend where the track descended down through the cutting between the steep rock outcroppings i risked a look over my shoulder to see that we had gained ground on our pursuers we would have to hurry to get everyone up but once through the gap we would have a clear path and i doubted the seljuqs would think it worthwhile to follow so with a prayer on my lips my heart thudding in my chest i slowed the pace of the grey enough to allow sydoni to go ahead padraig had already reached the cutting and disappeared up the path yordanus followed holding to the saddle like a child as the horse leapt onto the trail sydonis mount shied hi she shouted and gave the reluctant animal a sharp kick in the flanks with her heels the horse darted into the gap after the others then it was my turn the seljuqs were almost on me i slapped the reins hard and urged the animal forwards the magnificent grey responded without a quiver of complaint surging up through the cutting and onto the rockstrewn path i saw sydoni gain the track on the other side she paused and looked back go go i shouted tm right behind you she disappeared in a clatter of hooves and i saw clear light through the gap and an empty trail ahead that was the last thing i saw for the next thing i knew earth and sky had changed places and the ground was rising up before my face i was thrown clear of the horse and landed hard against the side of the bank loose rock pelting down on me dust filled my lungs and eyes i could not breathe or see my head felt as if it had been driven down between my shoulder blades every bone and joint in my body ached and my right arm tingled strangely my hands were scraped raw and my clothes were torn the flesh peeled away from my right hip in a wide and nasty gash i could not think what had happened all i knew was that one moment i had been making good my escape and the next there was a seljuq standing over me with a swordpoint at my throat i made to rise but the fellow put his foot on my chest and shoved me firmly back down i lay back choking and blinking trying to drag my shattered senses together a second warrior appeared above me spoke a word and the two of them reached down and hauled me roughly upright i found myself looking into the impassive face of the seljuq leader now of course i know that the arab chieftain who addressed me was the atabeg of albistan at the time however all i knew was that besides the white plume he possessed the natural authority of a respected leader a single word or the flick of a hand brought unquestioning obedience from his men he regarded me with neither rancour nor curiosity his shrewd dark eyes taking the measure of his prisoner he must not have been impressed with what he saw before him for after the briefest scrutiny he said something to his companion and turned away he moved towards his horse and prepared to remount the seljuq warrior beside me tightened his grip and his comrade with the sword stepped asideso as to get a better stroke i thought bracing myself for the killing blow but the man moved away and i looked to see my own mount thrashing on the ground trying to rise even in my dazed state i could see the poor beasts back was broken and probably his right foreleg as well in its eagerness to catch the others the spirited grey had taken the path too quickly and had stumbled on the loose rock the commander spoke another quick burst to the soldier with the sword who bent to examine the injury to the animal his brief scrutiny completed he stood the slow shake of his head confirmed what everyone already knew there was no hope for the beast the commander raised his chin sharply and the warrior bowed two men joined the first one took the reins and the other brought out a short throwing spear from its holder beneath his saddle they made the horse lie on its side and while one held the reins tightly the other held the animals head down stroking the long jaw and whispering into its ear the third warrior approached from behind with the spear a quick thrust up under the creatures skull and it was over the poor beast gave a shuddery kick wheezed and lay still satisfied that the horse had not suffered the commander then turned and started back the way they had come a loop of rope was passed around my waist and i was led off down the dry riverbed i had to run to keep up but mercifully it was no great distance else i might have collapsed even so my lungs were burning and dark spots were dancing before my eyes by the time we reached our destinationa low place on the steep bank near where a number of christian footmen and a few knights had thought to make their escape from the battlefield they had been ridden down and killed and their bodies now lay strewn over the rocks and sand splattered red with their blood the seljuq raiding party had been searching for any who might have escaped along the river when we ran into them after a quick search of the dead for valuables they were stripped of weapons and armour and the seljuq commander led his men up the low bank and out onto the plain once more leading me and three riderless horses behind them most of the dead were amassed in the centre of the plain near the road they had been travelling on when ghazi sprang his trap as we approached the road where the fighting had been fiercest i began to see corpses heaped one upon anothermost of them without armour and a few even without weapons i wondered at this and decided that the ambush must have caught them so suddenly that the knights did not have time to arm themselves before the enemy was upon them they were cut down as they struggled into their helms and hauberks the blood of the slain had turned the dustdry road into a sodden mess churned to vile mud by the feet of soldiers and seljuq horses already the air was thick with the stink of curdling blood as the white hot sun beat down on the carnage the sicksweet stench filled my nostrils bringing the gorge to my mouth i gasped and gagged as i was pulled along desperate to keep my feet lest i be dragged through the goreslick muck i tried not to look at the dead and averted my eyes whenever i could their slack mouths and lolling tongues their astonished empty stares their raw and gaping woundslest they be disgraced in my sight their piteous plight filled me with an immense and oppressive remorse i stumbled across the battleplain staggering over the corpses bitterness welling anew with every step an entire army had been cruelly cut down for the ambition of one heedless headstrong lord god help me i cursed bohemond for the sacrilege of the selfwilled arrogance that had blithely squandered so many lives my seljuq captors came to a place a little distance from the road where the victors were gathering there under the watchful eyes of their commanders a vast company of warriors were enthusiastically stripping the dead of their armour weapons and clothing the various itemsswords shields helmets spears mail caps and hauberks and the likewere brought and tossed onto the swiftly growing heap nearby another smaller pile was also increasing this one contained all the items of silver and gold or other valuable objects bohemond had pressed hard in his effort to reach the armenian stronghold as quickly as possible so the crusaders had not pillaged many towns along the way and consequently had little plunder with them while i watched this dismal display a great cry went up from a host of seljuq warriors massed a short distance away where they were occupied with some great amusement they waved their curved swords in the air shouting loudly and enthusiastically i could not make out what demanded such zealous attention but more and more warriors were being drawn to the display i was still trying to determine what was happening when amir ghazi arrived surrounded by a bodyguard of fifty warriors on horseback most of them on milkwhite stallions like his own and all dressed alike in cloaks of deepest blue with crimson turbanshe sat comfortably upon a raised cushioned saddle of fine polished leather edged in silver a small smoothfaced man he was swathed in shimmering blue samite and wore a huge red turban surmounted by a peacock plume held in place with a great glittering emerald the size of a duck egg in his cloak of white samite he fairly gleamed like a star in the harsh sunlight as he sat in his high saddle and gazed at the stillgrowing mounds of treasure and weapons with the calm beatific smile of a cheerful god he advanced and reined up before the atabeg and his men the two addressed one another amiably and fell to discussing as i imagined the battle and its aftermath at one point the amir turned his attention to me my captor simply shrugged as if my presence was of little consequence and they went back to their conversation they were thus occupied when all at once another tremendous shout went up from the nearby host the amir turned in the saddle and raising himself in his silver stirrups attempted to peer over the heads of the closegathered throng fatting this he spoke a command to his men and a dozen or so warriors wheeled their mounts and rode to the gathering on the plain using the butts of their spears the warriors began prodding them out of the way clearing a path by which the amir might see what was taking place just beyond them as the pathway widened i saw with sickening dread what it was that so engrossed the watching warriors the bloody execution of the prisoners not all of the crusaders had been slaughtered in the valley two hundred or so remained alive and had surrendered themselves these men had been herded together onto the plain and were now undergoing summary execution by the victors this was bad enough what made it infinitely worse was the way in which the executions were being carried out even as i watched one poor wretch of a foot soldier was pulled screaming from among his companions and hauled to the centre of the plain where he was released the instant he was freed two seljuq riders sped out from the near end of the fieldone with a spear and the other brandishing a sword the two closed rapidly on the fleeing crusader leaning from the saddle the foremost arab waved his sword high there was a glinting flash of steel in the air and the victims head flew from his shoulders spinning bright ribbons of blood into the air the decapitated corpse stumbled on a step or two and collapsed jerking and quivering until it lay still the disembodied head struck the barren ground to roll like a lumpy ball in the dust the whole hideous spectacle was greatly and warmly cheered by the ecstatic onlookers many of whom had struck wagers on the riders ability that they should do this appalled me and rage bubbled up like molten rock inside me instantly i was overcome by a towering fury my vision darkened and my blood flared like liquid fire in my veins burning with impotent rage i raised my fist to heaven and called down fiery judgement to consume the heartless infidel but the sky remained clear and no flaming thunderbolts descended to scorch the brutal victors heads when god withdraws his protective hand the powers of hell are swift to claim the spoils thirtytwo cait my light i cannot contain myself for the first time in my captivity a great fear and uncertainty has descended upon me and i do not know what to do i pace and pray the night away besieged by a hopeless dread the like of which i have never known this very night two members of the caliphs bodyguard burst into my cell although it was late and all the palace was silent i was hastened directly to the throne room where the exalted caliph had previously received me as you will remember the great room was in darkness save for two torches burning in sconces either side of a door at the far end of the room i was led across the empty expanse of floor to that door it was opened and one of the soldiers indicated that i was to enter i did so the door closed behind me and i found myself in a small chamber alone in the light of a single candletree i saw a small threelegged stool with a leather seat and a large blue satin cushion of the kind favoured by the caliph there was a table with a bowl of dates and figs and a brass bell as i stood looking at these things and wondering why i had been brought here in the dead of night i heard a curious grinding sound very like that of a mill wheel when it turns it seemed to come from across the room and even as i looked a small seam opened in the corner of the wall this seam became a low door which swung outward a belch of cool air washed over me and i smelled the stale scent of damp musty earth and it came to me that the many scattered rooms and buildings of the palace compound were no doubt connected by an elaborate system of passages and tunnels i heard the slap of a footstep and an instant later who should emerge from the hidden passage but caliph alhafiz himself with torch in hand he wore no turban and was dressed only in his nightclothes his white hair streamed from his head as if he had been tearing at it and his beard was wild and uncombed indeed he looked like a man driven from his bed by the force of a nightmare that yet bedevilled him he started when the door closed behind him and looked around at me his eyes were baleful dark and staring the grimace with which he beheld me did not bode well i thought for the outcome of our meeting nevertheless i bowed respectfully and waited for him to begin he placed the torch in a sconce beside the door and pointed to the stool indicating that i was to sit i did so and he sat too crosslegged on the blue cushion facing me a strange meeting this i thought no advisors counsellors servants or minions no impressive array of guards to lend him stature no lavish and costly appointments of gold and silk and sandalwoodjust the two of us man to man he looked at me hard and i returned his gaze i saw that he trembled slightly as old men do when palsy claims thema quiver of the head a minute shaking of the hands then he began nodding and intoning a chant in arabic after a moment he sighed and then leapt up again and began striding around the room i watched him mystified by his behaviour yet moved to pity by the severity of the agitation which gripped him so tightly so he cried at last then as if frightened by the violence of his outburst he repeated it again but more softly so it comes to this my lord i replied i am khalifa ruler and protector of egypt armies march at my command i say what will be and it is i am the law and the hope of my people and i answer to allah alone he stared at me as if daring me to defy him indeed my lord i said yet he thrust a finger into the air it comes to this he seemed content with this statement and took up his pacing again legs stumping arms jerking stiffly i still could not understand his meaning and the suspicion that he might be mad was rapidly hardening to certainty you wished to see me my lord i reminded him gently do not presume he shouted instantly angry i have but to speak a word and your life is forfeit to your impertinence forgive me most excellent khalifa your servant awaits your pleasure this seemed to calm him somewhat he sat down again you are a father he said almost accusingly so it seemed that i am my lord you know the love of a father for his children he declared speaking as if it were a celebrated and widely proclaimed fact of my existence i do yes god knows he nodded then you know also the anguish of a father who must chastise his rebellious child it is a torment that tears at the very soul i sympathized yaallah it is true he cried closing his eyes he began slowly rocking back and forth his wrinkled face an image of the pain that was torturing him he sat that way for a long time and i did not intrude on his misery after awhile he drew a long breath and opened his eyes i am the law and the protection of my people he said his voice calm and steady justice is my decree it is written a man who knows the will of allah and fails to do it shall not escape the everlasting flames of damnation and again a believer who departs from the path of righteousness is no better than an infidel he shall find his reward among the damned he regarded me sharply defiant once more is this not so it is so my lord i agreed yes he sighed his voice soft almost broken it comes to this my son is rebellious and unbelieving he has done great wickedness and the blood of the murdered demands justice you are a father you love your child you know what i am saying until that moment i had struggled to understand his anguish but as he spoke these last few words the awful import of his summons awakened in me i knew exactly what he was talking about eye for eye tooth for tooth and life for life that he said is the cold heart of the law i felt my own heart grow cold my son must answer to allah for his wickedness he continued justice must be satisfied and righteousness upheld as i am khalifa it must be he looked at me meaningfully willing me to understand the hair on the back of my neck prickled as his purpose broke upon me i was to be that instrument of justice that was why he had summoned me you are a nobleman and a father he said again you understand these things i understand your predicament my lord i admitted woodenly wishing with all my heart that i did not i am khalifa he snapped suddenly do not presume forgive me most excellent khalifa i am unworthy of your regard he stood again quickly he shouted for the guards and the door opened at once pointing to me he spoke a rapid command in arabic whereupon they seized me and pulled me away as i was dragged from the room alhafiz shouted pray to your god christian pray as a father that you might live to see your beloved child once more thus i was returned to my cell and left to think about what had taken place the more i pondered the implications of the strange audience the more extraordinary it became in his great despair the caliph of egypt had turned to me he had sought my aid with his wretched son in some way i had become confessor to the caliph why i asked myself why had he chosen me he commanded armies as he had needlessly reminded me the word of the caliph is law justice is my decree why confide these things to me a mere prisoner in his keep the old mans reasons remained as dark and inscrutable as the beclouded night itself eye for eye tooth for tooth and life for life the reasons for the caliphs confidence may have eluded me but his purpose i suspectedand feared he was asking me to be the instrument of his justice he was asking me to kill his son great king and saviour i prayed inwardly quaking may this cup pass from me at the command of the atabeg i was taken out onto the plain to join the other prisoners awaiting execution too exhausted and dispirited to lift their heads they sat slumped on the ground with eyes downcast their faces ashen with fatigue their hearts numb with terror those with presence of mind enough to know their peril were praying fervently their voices formed a continual low gabble over which the moans and cries of the wounded among them drifted like a mournful dirge my turkish captors untied me and pushed me down with the others the man next to me raised his head as i settled in beside him he regarded me dully his battered face rapidly blackening beneath livid bruises to his cheek and jaw and neck his chin was split to the bone and oozing big drops of blood are you a priest he asked in a ragged voice no i replied he made no reply but his head sank lower and then it came to me what he was asking no man feeling the cold hand of death on his shoulder wishes to die unshriven but i will pray with you if you like i offered he nodded and clasping his hands beneath his chin struggled to his knees before me and began to pray it was a simple prayer yet well composed and at the end of it he begged the heavenly fathers forgiveness for his many sins and asked the good lord to remember his mother and his wife and not to let them sink into beggary now that he was gone when he finished i prayed that christ the blessed redeemer of men would carry the prayer before the heavenly throne and what is your name the man opened his eyes and glanced at me your name friend what is it girardus carry the prayer before the high throne of heaven and that girardus last wish for his family will be granted i said the amen and signed him with the cross as i had seen emlyn and padraig do when shriving sinners rubbing unshed tears from his eyes the soldier thanked me and then having made peace with his creator bent his head to prepare himself for death all at once there arose a commotion across the field i glanced in the direction of the sound and saw a rider streaking towards us followed by at least a dozen more they reined in before the resplendent amir ghazi on his milkwhite stallion exchanged a few heated hasty words and the amir called a command to his men who were at that moment dragging another screaming wretch out from among the beaten crusaders then one of the newcomersa small darkskinned turk with a bristly white beard and a face as flat and scuffed as the bottom of a bootshouted something turned his mount and rode out to where we were awaiting execution this arab carried no weapons save a curved goldhandled knife the pommel of which protruded from his dirty cloth belt he glared at all around him with a dark and angry countenance as if furious that we should be reclining while he laboured long in the saddle the glittering amir advanced and smiling pleasantly addressed the angry arab in as i thought placating tones the two began to converse and i supposed the agitated newcomer was being informed of the disposition of the captives he is furious as a tarred ferret observed girardus the amir does not appear overly concerned i pointed out he is not the amir girardus informed me indicating the small dark angry man he said that is amir ghazi i looked again at the man i had taken for a lowly scout unlike the other arab chieftains i had seen the amir was arrayed no better than the lowest soldier in his war host instead of flaunting his superiority he wore the simple black dress of tunic and trousers of a seljuq warrior with black boots of soft leather the only difference that i could see was that where their turbans were black or brown his was sandcoloured if girardus had told me he was a trinket pedlar i would have believed him certainly the man i saw glaring down at us from the saddle appeared more disposed to selling brass baubles in the street than commanding the combined armies of the mighty seljuq tribes that is amir ghazi i said staring at the dusty sweating turk are you certain yes and he is enraged why he is angry with his commanders for killing so many captives noblemen are worth fortunes in ransom and the rest can be sold as slaves ghazi says their thoughtlessness has cost a great deal of money which could have been used to further the war against the franj i looked at girardus in amazement how do you know this i speak arabic a little he said i professed this to be a very wonder no he shook his head it is six years in antioch if that is ghazi i said who is the other one that is kaisin tanzuk sultan of jezirah my informer replied they say he is wealthier than the caliph of baghdad what is he say shh girardus cut me off as he tried to follow the exchange after a moment the crusader turned to me his bruised features forming an expression of pathetic relief the killing is stopped we are to be taken to damascus satisfied that his command was understood amir ghazi returned to his chieftains and began ordering the withdrawal of the army while i was mightily grateful to be spared a messy and inglorious death my relief was tempered somewhat by the realization that my rescue would now take longer i had allowed myself to hope that once padraig and the others discovered what had happened to me they would ride to anazarbus alert roupen and the armenians would instantly ride to my aid in a little while a number of turks approached with coils of rope and began tying the captives together it is only for a short while i told myself as the seljuq warrior passed the loop of tough leather rope around my neck they will come for me when they realize what has happened they will come for me the rope was pulled tight around my throat looped back to my hands and secured when he finished i was bound to girardus who was joined to someone else and so onand the warrior gave the rope a final tug and began leading us away i stumbled forwards into the strange and frightening nightmare world of the war captive thirtythree so began the most wretched portion of my life i will spare you the most painful incidents dearest caitriona i could not bear the thought that my distress should cause you grief even through my sorest trial my chief consolation was that you would not know how your father suffered thus you would remain forever blissful in your memories of meif indeed you should remember me at all you were so young when i left you heart of my heart and for that i am sorry believe me i have repented ten thousand times since then ah but dull ignorant man that i am i did not perceive the swift sure hand of god moving mightily in the chaos of those calamitous days no doubt padraig would have had the wit to perceive the subtle textures of our lords grand design in the intricate warp and weft of time and the myriad actions of men look here duncan the good priest might have said see how the cloak is made of many threadssome light some dark the pattern is in the interplay of both and who but the weaver can foresee the design i miss padraig greatly and pray for him constantly as i do for you my soul yes and every day i curse my ignorance and folly how arrogant i was imagining i could bring some small order into the chaos of the seething benighted east i rue the day i allowed myself to become so deeply mired in affairs that did not concern me and which only drew me further and further away from the true aim of the pilgrimage if we had but waited one more dayhalfaday eventhe battle would have reached its inevitable conclusion and i never would have been captured had we but waited halfaday i would not be here now at the pleasure of the caliph of cairo by whose sufferance i yet draw breath and yet as padraig never tires of pointing out the swift sure hand does bend all things to the good of those who love him as much as i entrust my hope to this belief i cannot truly say i perceived the smallest tincture of good in that arduous and harrowing journey to damascus if there was a design in that i confess i never saw it perhaps i may be forgiven my dullness of sight however most days i was busy fighting for my life amir ghazi commanded the massed armies to move south at once as i think on it now he must have recognized the priceless opportunity he had won having vanquished antiochs protecting forces he moved to press his advantage as far as it would go so without a pause to draw breath much less celebrate their victory the amirs army was on the move once more in preparation for this seljuq warriors searched through the ranks of crusader captives with swords anyone with a disabling wound was instantly put to death those with lesser injuries were spared and allowed to continue so long as they could walk still as the days passed there were times when i reckoned a quick chop in the neck might have been the greatest kindness we marched from the plain of battle and into the low hills to the north and east it was long past dark when we stopped i spent a cold night on the ground in the company of eight other prisoners we were tied together in groups to keep us from escaping and each group separated from the others so that we could not raise rebellion too disheartened to speak we lay there on the stony ground and slept the sleep of the dead indeed a good few did not rise in the morning and a fair few more who did begin the days march did not finish that day cast the pattern for all the days to follow our captors roused us at first light prodding us awake with the butts of their spears we were bound together twobytwo each man to another with short cords around the ankles and a slightly longer one around the neck our hands were tied behind us then we were given a drink of water and the army moved off heading south the main body of the seljuq warhost rode on ahead the captives travelled behind with the slowermoving baggage train we shuffled along watching the dull sky brighten trying to ignore the leather rope chafing our ankles with every step soon the sun broke above the surrounding hills and we began to feel the heat of the day to come as the sun climbed higher in the empty white shell of the sky the heat mounted and leeched away the little strength the night had restored to us by midday some of the worse off had reached their journeys end they collapsed along the trail our arab masters were deaf to the cries of the suffering and dying they pushed mercilessly pausing only to give us enough water to keep us alive and movingnever enough to satisfy our parched and burning throats hungry thirsty aching from our various wounds and injuries we shuffled over the barren hills our heads down our hearts cold hard stone in our chests day after infernal day we did not talk there was nothing to say the sun blazed down on our naked heads with the heatblast of a forge fire sweat streamed from us stinging our eyes and dissipating our rapidly dwindling strength to the arid desert air in this way the decimated christian army dragged itself across the scorching wastes staggering under the burden of its wounded muted curses and muttered psalms ascended heavenward in equal measure as the slow torture of heat and thirst began to exact a cruel tariff when men fell the nearest seljuq guard would ride to see whether any purpose might be served in getting the man back on his feet if the crusader had life enough in him those nearby were ordered to carry him if not he was simply left where he lay and the death march moved on often those left behind cried out for the knife to end their misery but these like all other pleas went unheeded the fourth day was the worst i have ever endured around midday a badly wounded soldier collapsed directly in front of girardus and myself pulling down the man bound to him the seljuq guard rode up and without bothering to dismount commanded the three of us to get the unconscious man on his feet once more for this we required the use of our hands and so our bonds were loosed which was a mercy in itself the three of us were able to raise the wretch but it was clear he could no longer walk unaided so we took it in turn to help himwith two holding him up between us and ailbut dragging him along while the third rested when one of us became weary the rested one would take his place and so on meanwhile our suffering comrade drifted from bad to worse after a time he could no longer move his feet and so we carried him taking his entire weight on our shoulders damnably awkward it was and it very quickly exhausted us soon it became a trial merely to put one foot before the other and remain upright i set my jaw to the task and trudged on and on through the interminable length of that endless day after a time the searing ache in my legs and arms eased as my limbs grew gradually numb i could no longer feel the uneven ground beneath my feet and this caused me to stumble over rocks each lurch and jostle brought a moan from our unconscious comrade but his complaints grew gradually weaker and more infrequent the land was a barrens of broken rock and thorns gnarled trees white with dust and shrivelled by the merciless sun twisted up from stony crevices everything in that godforsaken land was blasted blighted and deformed no less easy on the eye than underfoot the harshness seared itself into the soul never did a scrap of green or any other colourrelieve the limitless sameness seeking refuge from the sun and blight i turned in my mind to thoughts of blessed scotland and the family waiting there i brought the image of each face before my minds eye and prayed for the soul of every one i could recall in this way i withstood the rigours of that inhuman day when at last the sun began to fade behind the western hills the seljuqs stopped to make camp for the night the three of us stiffly lowered our wounded comrade to the ground and collapsed beside him we lay there panting like sunscalded dogs unmoving sweat running in rivulets from our spent bodies to stain the dust beneath us the sun was almost down when one of the seljuqs brought a waterskin and revived us with a few mouthfuls of water after i drank i drew myself up on my elbows to rouse our wounded comrade so he could get his share it was then i discovered he was dead when he died and how long we had carried his lifeless corpse i cannot say all i know is that his life passed from him silently and without so much as a sigh he lay with his mouth open and eyes closed as if asleepasleep for ever more the guard noted the death with a shrug and turned away we slept that night tied to a corpse and were only released the next morning when the guard cut us free so we could move on i prayed i would not die like that wretch unmourned unknown nothing more than an accursed burden to those around me we were wakened the next morning to begin another hellish day my arms and legs felt cast of lead my head ached and my mouth was coated with scum those of us left alive were given a fair ration of water which we gulped down quickly lest the guards change their minds i thanked god for every mouthful many there were who could not face the day and refused to get up the seljuqs killed two unfortunates where they lay and the rest faced with a spear in the gut and an agonizing lingering death found the strength to rise once more the land grew rough and craggy the trail degenerated into rugged little goat tracks through dry streams and over shattered hills making the march yet more strenuous and difficult time and again the cry went up for water food or rest we were given none of these things i kept myself alive with psalms and prayers reciting the lord is my shepherd i shall not want the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he makes me to lie down in pastures green beside the still waters he leads me though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death lord i walk through the valley of the shadow of death yet i no evil fear no evil fear no evil fear over and over and over again i spoke these words and the rhythm of their speaking became a litany of life to me for as long as i could say them i knew i would liveat least to the end of the psalm the searing relentless heat and lack of water began to claw at our numbers all around me men collapsed and fell and as the eternal day wore on and on with no end in sight i began to regard these as the lucky ones mumbling my psalm i moved in and out of dreams i saw padraig walking before me and tried to hail him but my throat was so dry i could not make a sound when i looked again it was just another captive crusader i saw my father murdo sitting on a rock beside the trail he shook his head in pity as i passed and i wanted to speak to him to tell him how sorry i was to leave home without telling him but he melted into the empty air before i could find voice to speak the words i smelled the clean salt air of the sea back home i smelled the water and heard the restless sea waves slapping the rocks and tumbling the smooth stones on the shingle i heard the shrill keen of the seabirds wheeling in the bold blue clouddazzled skya sky never seen in the desert wilderness of the holy land the scents and sounds caused me to imagine the faces of those i loved and i heard the babble of their voices filling my ears i tried to make out what they said but in their joy at having me among them once more they spoke over one another so that i could not understand them holding up my hands i made to speak and forced out a ragged croak and this made them excited they rushed to me and i was pulled this way and that and i realized they were dragging me down to the sea stifflegged i tried to resist my strength was gone and i was shoved down to the water i felt the blessed wetness lapping around my feet and legs i heard others splashing in behind me and turned to see the dusty faces of my fellow pilgrims floundering into the sea how i wondered had they come to be in scotland had they followed me there had we walked all the way and then people began throwing water over me the cold shock restored me to my mind water i sank down to my knees and began scooping it up in my hands throwing it into my mouth and gulping it down choking on it and gulping down more the water revived me i raised my eyes and looked around gone the cold ocean bay and gone the prosperous holding snug amongst the dazzling green hills before me was a sunbaked settlement shaded by a few scruffy trees and forlorn palms on the bare earth banks of a muddy but very real lake the people there were not my beloved friends and family but muhammedan shepherds my heart writhed within me as the dull realization seeped into my sundazed awareness i was alive still and far far from home we stayed there that night revived by the water and blessed with a moments respite from the days heat as evening drew near the captives began to appraise their chances of survival and they began to talk i soon learned what had happened after padraig roupen and i had fled antioch commander renaud had not allowed the templar garrison to be used to aid prince bohemonds ruinous folly in defiance of the prince he had refused to send the poor soldiers of christ into battle against other christians opinion among the captives divided sharply over whether this was good or bad if the templars had been with us by christ one soldier swore we would not have been defeated that just shows how stupid you are thomas villery growled the man next to him if the templars had been there they would have been killed along with all the rest yes agreed another it is for the best at least this way we have a hope of rescue what makes you think anyone will rescue us no one cares concluded another gloomily his head sank onto his chest god has given us over to destruction his hand is against us we are dead meneach and every one of us there is no hope has the turd turned philosopher now scoffed the soldier called thomas when the garrison learns that bohemonds army has been captured they will ride at once to the rescue and who is going to tell them eh demanded another soldier struggling to rise he had been slashed on the arm and the wound showing through the bloodcrusted rag of his sleeve was grey and watery with pus idiot who is going to ride to antioch to tell them eh he glared furiously around the ring of grim faces gaston is right we are all dead men what demanded the one called thomas when they learn the rood has been captured they will come by god do not speak to me of god or the rood muttered gaston if the rood goes before us we cannot loseso they said it is gods good pleasure to lead us to victory they said where is the victory now he glared around daring anyone to challenge him damn them damn their lies forgive me brother i said breaking into their conversation is it the holy cross you mean aye he agreed dubiously is there any other the black rood one of them muttered taken by the cursed heathen seljuqs he spat much good may it do them god knows it has done no good for us shut your stinking gob matthias charged thomas maybe it is for blasphemers like you that the almighty gave us up to defeat did you ever think of that how dare you come the high and holy with me snarled the offended matthias i was well and truly shriven ere we left the citywe all were youll not go laying the blame for this at my feet so help me where is it i asked interrupting their argument the rood why the turks have taken it answered matthias they will have it with the rest of the plunder christ alone knows what they will do with it the heathens theyll burn it suggested girardus dolefully by god they will for they are godless devil worshippers every hellcursed one the discussion moved on to speculation about what would happen to us when we reached damascus but as no one had any notion i turned instead to pondering what i had learned the holy rood was here somewhere i determined then and there that if the high king of heaven allowed me to remain alive i would resume my quest somehow i would find the holy rood and i would save it this i vowed to do thirtyfour we stayed four days at kadiriq a bakedmud settlement on the banks of the stagnant lake regaining our strength for the days ahead i suspect the march from anazarbus had been made as tortuous as possible to kill off the weak and wounded the seljuqs wanted slaves to sell and only those strong enough to survive the ordeal would bring a price worth the trouble of keeping them alive i slept nearly all of the first day and the second i spent lying in the shade of a gnarled little tree beside the lake could not bear to be out of sight of the water and several times went in swimming to cool off the sight of this whiteskinned foreigner thrashing around in the shallows produced great amusement for the children of kadiriq who had come out to examine the conquered captives that night we were given food for the first time since the battle flat breadthin and dry and tough as parchmentand lentils cooked in beef broth the second night we were given bread and beans again and some leathery scraps of goat meat on the third day amir ghazi arrived he travelled in caravan that is to say with his entire retinue of advisors liegemen and a bodyguard of three hundred or more warriorsall mounted and leading a long train of pack animals mostly horses however moving with a strange swaying gait i saw the odd ungainly desert creatures called camels with their steephumped backs long necks and small flat heads they seemed to tower above the surrounding turmoil with lordly sufferance the newcomers arrived leading a few dozen more prisoners rumours spread among the captives that the main seljuq army had taken the town of marash on the border allowing the amir to enrich himself still further with christian slaves and plundered treasure ghazi set up his camp on the other side of the lake i counted over a hundred tents before losing interest the townspeople were overjoyed to have the honour of hosting the amir and that night there was a feast in his name a dozen cows were slaughtered for the spit and a score of sheep and goats the festive mood overflowed the town and even spilled out into the captives camp to the extent that we were given a humble share of the feast that night along with our bread a soft thick flat bread flavoured with anise we were also given lamb stewed with figs it was very good and there was not a man among us who did not lick the wooden bowl clean we were also given a drink of fermented goats milk slightly salty with a rancid sour taste which failed to seduce many to its charms the next morning rested fed and as hale as i could hope to be in the uncertain days ahead i determined to try my luck with amir ghazi the sun was high and the wind hot out of the south i was bathing in the lake when two of the amirs bodyguard appeared they spoke to the seljuq keeping watch on the bank and i decided the time had come hauling myself from the water i motioned for girardus to accompany me and came to stand before them on the bank what are you doing he whispered desperately tell them i demand to see the amir he gaped at me in disbelief and started to object tell them the guards glanced at us with haughty contempt but otherwise ignored us i do not think they speak arabic girardus concluded quickly let us go before they make trouble for us tell them make them understand rolling his eyes girardus spoke up interrupting the seljuqs who were not pleased with our persistence the guard shouted something and waved his hands at us to drive us away they say to go away girardus said much relieved i demand to see the amir i said holding my ground tell them i demand it girardus use that word i demand to see him at once after another shouted exchange girardus said they say no one can see the amir tell them i am a nobleman and a friend of lord thoros of armenia and i demand to see amir ghazi at once to his credit girardus swallowed his fear and spoke up once more in a halting and trembling voice he told the guards what i had said the seljuq guard started towards us waving his spear and shouting but one of the amirs men took him by the arm and pulled him back he motioned me to him without hesitation i stepped up he gazed at me his dark eyes searching mine the second guard said something and flapped a hand at me but the first guard took me by the arm and turned me around indicating that i was to walk before them god go with you called girardus they marched me around the lake to where the amir had established his camp upon arrival i was brought to stand outside the amirs tent which was pale blue instead of the deep blackbrown of all the others i was given to understand that i was to remain there a few score paces before the tentand my two keepers spoke to a man who appeared briefly at the tent entrance before retreating to the shade of a small date palm beside the tent where they could watch me thus i stood waiting for my audience and observing the commerce of the camp amir ghazi was a very busy man judging by the comings and goings of the amirs many advisors and subject lords few of the people who entered the tent stayed very long i expect they were merely paying homage to the amir or discharging some perfunctory duty indeed the entire arab race from the highest caliph to the lowest goatherd is hedged about with a veritable wall of duties and obligations not one brick or block of which can be removed or altered surveying this continuous procession of lords and notables i marked again how very splendid were these noblemen arrayed in flowing clothes of the finest cloth and bedecked with gold and jewels they wore plumes of ostrich and peacock and carried jewelled weapons they gleamed and glittered in the bright sun astride their fine horses and accompanied by their retinues they all came bearing gifts which they carried in boxes of carved sandalwood sometimesdepending i think on the rank of the guest the amir met his visitor at the entrance to his tent and welcomed him with a kiss most often however it was one of the amirs servants who bowing low directed the guest into the great mans presence not all of the amirs visitors were men many of the nobles brought women with them and these from what i could see of them were even more magnificently arrayed than the menalthough they hid their splendour under long hooded outer cloaks or gowns which covered them head to toe and they wore veils across the lower parts of their faces so that between hood and veil only their eyes were visible but such eyes almond shaped and black as sloe with long lashes and brows thin and dark and delicately curved it put me in mind of sydoni and i spent a long time happily thinking about heruntil i remembered my grave predicament if i had not been such an impetuous fool i would no doubt be with her now my thoughts grew so forlorn and pitiable that i was forced to put them off at last it does no good to wallow in regret what might have been is as impossible as what can never be after awhile one of my guards fell asleep as i had been standing in the sun for a goodly while i sat down the other guard did not like this he hissed at me and gestured for me to stand up again and i obliged soon however he was fast asleep too and so i sat down again and pulled my siarc over my head to keep the sun off me while i waited the sun passed midday and began its long slow descent into the west still i sat in my place dozing now and again and waiting for the amir and still people came and went on errands of fealty and homage as the sun began to stretch my shadow towards the entrance to the tent i heard horses approaching a party of arab chieftains was riding into camp i climbed to my feet and as they dismounted i darted in among them and started for the entrance to the amirs tent one of the arabs called for me to stop i paid him no heed and kept walking one of the guardsmen roused by the shouting woke up and saw me however he rushed upon me and dragged me back to my place where he was joined by two others and all three began shouting and raining blows upon my head i do not know whether the disturbance i raised outside his tent drew the attention of the amir but as i was lying on the ground trying to protect my head and neck from the fists of the soldiers a man suddenly appeared in the midst of the commotion he barked a single sharp word of command and the men ceased their attack i looked up to see the atabeg of albistan the same who had captured me days before he recognized me too and bade me rise he pointed towards the tent and i saw the amir himself standing at the entrance surrounded by advisors and liegemen he was frowning mightily none too pleased at the interruption of his affairs rising slowly i dusted myself off and prepared for whatever would happen next the unhappy amir beckoned his attendant nobleman to him the atabeg put his hand on my arm and pulled me away from the guards and i was brought before the amir where i was made to kneel at his feet this was to humble me but i did not greatly mind it is no shame to acknowledge one who is above you and inasmuch as i was a lowly hostage in his camp amir ghazi was certainly superior in every way the black amir scowled down at me i cannot say what passed in his mind but i bowed as i had seen the other noblemen do touching my forehead to the ground and then employing my best greek said my name is duncan of caithness and i am a friend of prince thoros of armenia he glared and spoke a word of command and one of his advisors approached on the run this fellowan armenian i believe for in manner dress and appearance he was very like those i had met at the banquet in anazarbuswas an ungainly sallow skinned man with a large eaglebeaked nose and smooth hairless jowls like the wattles of a pig he cast a dour pitiless black eye over me who are you he asked in greek suspicion thickening his reedy voice i repeated what i had said before and added i am a pilgrim from a country in the far northwest where i am a lord and nobleman i befriended young lord roupen brother of prince thoros and son of leo and became his protector i was leaving anazarbus and blundered upon the battle by mistake i could tell he did not believe me he looked me up and down as if measuring for a coffin see how i am dressedare these the clothes of a crusader his frown of disbelief deepened also we are speaking greek i added badly he sniffed unimpressed tell me your name i commanded the armenian stiffened slightly at my audacity but he was well accustomed to taking orders and replied i am katib sahak of tarawn advisor to amir ghazi i thanked him and said i ask you now katib just sahak only he said katib is an arab word it means scribe i ask you sahak do the franks speak greek at this the armenian turned and held close conversation with the amir whose interest pricked slightly when he heard what sahak had to say about me breathing a fervent prayer i said i had no part in bohemonds army and took no part in the battle i was a guest of prince thoros and was captured by mistake i was with three others when this man captured me pointing to the atabeg i said ask him if this is not so the others were able to escape i alone was captured sahak discussed my story with the atabeg who nodded which i took as confirmation that i was telling the truth the atabeg of albistan agrees that it happened the way you say the scribe confirmed ghazi spoke up then and sahak added the amir demands proof looking directly at the amir i answered tell him i can prove i have come from the princes household when my words were interpreted for the amir i said this was given to me by princess elena for aiding the return of her son roupen so saying i pulled the neck of my siarc down and twisted it inside out to reveal the brooch i had pinned there the day i left anazarbus sahaks eyes went wide with amazement if you will look closely i said directing their attention to the carved ruby you will see that it bears the royal emblem i showed the gem to each of them in turn ghazi and the atabeg exchanged a few words and the amir issued his command give me the brooch the armenian translator said i refused saying the amir has said the noblemen are to be ransomed this i held the brooch before them is to be my ransom what is the word for ransom i asked in the amirs tongue what is the word namuslu keza replied the advisor tapping the brooch with my finger i repeated the word namuslu keza i said and prayed they understood what i was trying to tell them the amir made up his mind speaking gruffly he held out his hand to me amir ghazi says you are to give him the jewel i hesitated you have no choice sahak informed me you are to give it to him now it will be sent to anazarbus to inform them of your capture with great reluctance i obeyed unfastening the brooch and placing it in the amirs palm with a last appeal namuslu keza the amir closed his hand over the brooch turned on his heel and walked away pausing to toss a word of command to the guards as he retreated to his tent they took hold of me and i was taken back around the lake to resume my place with the captives girardus was glad at my return to the fold so to speak i never thought to see you again he confided they are saying the amir is holding court and judgements are being given it is true i told him other captives gathered closer to hear the amir is indeed holding court and he seems to be renewing the loyalties of his vassal lords i went on to describe what i had seen of the comings and goings of all the noblemen and women and gifts they brought when i finished girardus who had assumed they had taken me away to be tortured or beaten asked what did they do to you they kept me waiting all day in the sun i answered and then they brought me back here did you see the amir i saw him i said glumly i had hoped to persuade him to release me he was not in a mood to be persuaded he let you live girardus concluded that is something at least i remained with the others that night and wonder of wonders the guards came for me the next morning and i was brought to stand before the amirs tent as before i waited as more and still more nobles and dignitaries came to pay homage to amir ghazi i pondered the meaning of this activity and it came to me that perhaps defeating bohemonds army was an event of far greater significance for the seljuqs than i knew ignorant of the forces and powers that held sway in the holy land i could nevertheless imagine that a single great victory could produce a result with farreaching implications for the man who accomplished it certainly it would not be the first time a shrewd leader having delivered a decisive conquest had used it to concentrate his power further i could well imagine that the hole left in the defences of antioch had created an opportunity which such a leader might wish to exploit what the astute amir had in mind i could not guess but the activity in the camp gave every indication that he was marshalling his support for an important undertaking these thoughts occupied me until a little past midday when the atabeg of albistan whom i took to be one of the amirs chief advisors emerged from the tent he came to stand over me and i rose quickly to my feet after a cursory scrutiny he signalled the guarding warriors and i was escorted into the amirs tent an arab tent is a wondrous thing with very little effort the desert folk make them as spacious and comfortable as palaces the interior is often divided up into smaller rooms for meeting dining sleeping and so forth accordingly ghazis tent featured a large outer room where he received his guests before bringing them into his inner chambers so to speak this is where i was brought here also were the gifts which had been heaped upon the amir by those who came to do him honour there were many jewelled swords and knives and ornamental weapons of various sortsspears shields helmets bows and arrowsand other items of which the arab artisans excel in making chalices bowls platters and cunningly carved boxes of pierced wood inlaid with fine yellow gold and precious stones as i looked over this haphazard mound of wealth i recognized certain objects and realized there were also many items of plunder which the seljuq had taken from the defeated crusaders indeed rolled on its wooden pole i saw bohemonds golden banner and a fine new steel hauberk folded atop a chest a pair of gauntlets with the image of a hawks head a silver gorget and a long prankish sword i saw these things and more and the thought came to me it ishere the holy rood is here could it be my heartbeat quickened nothing of value escaped the keen appraising eye of the arab i stared at the jumbled trove and knew that it must be true hidden somewhere amongst all the gifts and plunder lay the greatest prize in christendom after a moment the armenian scribe who had served as my interpreter the day before appeared do you know why you have been brought here katib sahak asked his voice was cold and unforgiving i am hoping the amir has accepted my ransom payment and will now allow me to depart in peace that is for the amir to decide in bearing and tone sahak gave every indication of despising me he wishes to ask you some questions i urge you to tell the truth at all times your life depends on it be assured i will tell the truth he made a sound in his nose as if he thought such an endeavour unlikely follow me stepping to the inner partition he pulled back a fold of the cloth indicating that i should enter the room was simple and spare there was no furniture of any kind save cushions fine silken rugs had been spread thick on the ground to make a soft floor beneath the feet the mountain of gifts which filled the outer room encroached upon this room as well but here the heap was smaller and the objects more costly the amir sat in the centre of the room surrounded by four seljuqs who by dress and bearing i took to be noblemen and advisors the atabeg of albistan among them amir ghazis expression was stern and challenging his white beard bristled like hog hair on his flat wrinkled face he had put off his buffcoloured turban and his long grey hair was knotted into a hank which rested on his shoulder god is great he said in arabic sahak interpreted the amirs words for me to which i replied amen ghazi nodded and made a flicking motion with his hand the armenian bowed then turned to me and said his most excellent amir ghazi has considered your claim he has discussed this with his counsellors and it is the opinion of the amir that you were fleeing the armenian stronghold or else you would not have been captured is this not so yes my lord it is so i answered gazing full at ghazi it is the amirs opinion that there are many reasons for a man to flee the two most common and therefore most likely reasonsin the most excellent amirs sage opinionare these either you have made enemies among the royal family or you have committed some crime in the royal household perhaps the theft of the brooch with which you have attempted to purchase your freedom yes tell my lord the amir that i am not a thief i said trying to remain calm and unruffled i have stolen nothing neither have i made enemies among the royal family i might have insisted on recognition of my noble rank but it serves no purpose to allow ones selfimportance to erect obstacles at times like this as abbot emlyn says martyrs are often burned not for their beliefs but for their toplofty pride alone sahak repeated my assertion and then gave me the amirs terse reply it makes no difference he said amir ghazi says that you are to remain a captive you have said your friends escaped if this is so those who were with you will send ransom and then you will be freed by this he will know the truth and the matter will be concluded if no one comes for me i hated asking the question but i had to know you will be sold in the slave market in damascus with the rest of the captives who have no hope of ransom the amir watched me to see how i would take this news when i made no outcry or protest sahak said do you understand what i have told you completely i answered i am more than grateful for the amirs wide forbearance the rancorous scribes eyes narrowed as he tried to determine whether i was mocking him satisfied with my sincerity he relayed my words to ghazi who continued by virtue of the fact that you are a captive of war the amir said speaking through sahak you stand condemned yet it is written he who desires mercy shall mercy employ therefore i will show mercy to you least deserving of men he waited while his words were translated for me then said you have claimed to be a nobleman and indeed i find that you conduct yourself with admirable restraint and courtesytwo of the chief virtues of nobility mercy and generosity are two more i could see that ghazi for all his sly practicality nevertheless imagined himself something of a philosopher therefore sahak continued by the immense mercy and generosity of lord ghazi you will be accorded the honour and rank of a nobleman in captivity the pronouncement dismayed me i will not say otherwise yet i shouldered the burden of disappointment as manfully as i could i held my head erect and kept my mouth shut i tried to preserve my dignity in the circumstance by reminding myself that at least by remaining in ghazis camp a little while longer i would be near the black rood all noblemen are to be ransomed in damascus sahak told me with spiteful glee and should anyone wish to claim you the amir has decreed a price of ten thousand dinars for your release please tell the excellent and admirable amir ghazi that i am truly overwhelmed by the prodigious magnitude of his mercy and generosity sahak grimaced tomorrow we will continue our journey to damascus you will travel in the amirs baggage train with the other noble captives so that you will not offend the illustrious atabeg buri by arriving emptyhanded the wise and benevolent ghazi will provide you with a gift befitting your rank when the translator was finished the amir clapped his hands and a guard entered from the outer room ghazi beckoned him near and put his mouth to his servants ear the man rose quickly and left the amir enjoyed a shrewd smile at my expense and i felt a dread apprehension creep over me as the guard returned bearing a large wooden box which he placed on the floor between myself and the amir the box itself was one of the ornately carved variety i had noticed in the anteroom made of fine wood inlaid with gold tracery it was costly certainly but i reckoned the box itself was not the gift the wily amir had in mind open it commanded ghazi through his gloating armenian mouthpiece i knelt down and unfastened the simple hasp then taking the top in both hands i steeled myself and lifted the hinged lid to reveal a severed human head one brief glimpse of the long yellow hair and the neat forked beard gave me to know it was none other than the golden head of incautious prince bohemond thirtyfive impetuous no more prince bohemond appeared serene and tranquil his fine features becalmed if not beatifica testimony to the embalmers art for even in my fleeting encounter with the hasty count of antioch i could tell that serenity was never part of his nature certainly i had never seen him looking more contented as if in death his war with the world now over he had entered a splendour of peace that had eluded him in life the flesh had a waxy texture and a slightly glistening tawny sheen due to the pitch resin used to preserve the head yet it was lifelike in every other way so that poor bohemond seemed merely to slumber in the serene tranquility of a golden sunset alas it was a sleep from which there would be no waking and i might have mourned the life of a brother christian so brutally cut offif not for the fact that he had brought this ghastly extremity upon himself he had sown destruction and reaped a bounteous harvest those who deserved my grief were the men who had no choice but to follow their vainglorious prince into deaths cold and darksome halls my seljuq masters wanted me to feast my gaze upon the grisly prize that i might know the fate awaiting noble traitors oh they took great pleasure in their victory of which the princes head was the emblem given a choice i believe amir ghazi would rather have had the ransom moneydoubtless the prince would have paid an enormous fortune in treasure for his freedom still the wily amir was not sorry to have annihilated a foe whose continued presence would have been a bane and a curse they presented me with the box and the armenian katib informed me that i was to carry ita sort of punishment i suppose for causing the amir the aggravation of having to deal with me or maybe it was the scribes revenge for my subtle mockery of the day before whatever the reason i carried the head of bohemond on my back all the way to damascus a loathsome labour i cursed the arrogant young lord every trudging step of the way provided with a length of folded cloth to serve as a strap i hoisted the bejewelled box onto my back and followed the other servants when upon striking camp they set off the box was heavy and in a discouragingly short time my shoulders and arms were throbbing with a fiery ache i eventually worked out that by knotting the ends of the strap and raising the knot to my forehead the pressure on my shoulders was relieved by taking some of the weight on my hands it was awkward and bent me like an old man but at least i was able to walk like this for long stretches at a time without exhausting myself on that first day i wondered why it was that the amirs caravan made no attempt to keep pace with the troops after a time it became apparent that we were travelling by another route this caused me some concern and i hoped we would eventually rejoin the rest of the seljuq army as i did not like being separated from the other christian prisoners then as the day dwindled away towards evening and we stopped to make camp i was joined by three other captive noblemen bound for ransom in damascus all were franks one of them had been wounded in the battle and still suffered from his wounds the other two were nobles of a more rustic stripe who knew little latin and no greek which made it difficult to speak with them also because of my dress and speech they thought me an armenian and worthy only of contempt say what i might i could not disabuse them of this notion consequently they would have nothing to do with me and i was left to myself for the most part in many ways those servants employed in the keeping of the amirs camp had the best of the travelling since much of the treasure and tribute was loaded onto horses requiring the servants to walk along beside they stopped regularly for rest and watermuch more often than the great mass of the army which pushed swiftly on so when they rested my fellow prisoners and i rested and when they drank we drank those first few days were blessedly shortened or i do not believe i would have survived as it was we walked until the burning sun stretched our shadows long behind us then the chief steward having found a suitable place would give the command to set up camp in this chore i had no part each servant had his special duties and as i was given nothing to doexcept fetch water for the animals occasionallyi was most often able to rest and watch the hurried proceedings as tents were erected cooking fires lit and meals prepared each evening as the flametinted sky flared with the days last brilliance the amir and his retinue would arrive and the camp would be ready the amir ate a simple meal usually alone and then received members of his followingsometimes singly more often in groups of two or three left to myself for the most part i would find a hollow place among the stones to sleep and lay on the ground listening to the sound of the seljuqs voices loud in the quiet of the camp they talked long into the night their intense discussions frequently interrupted by bursts of rowdy laughter which would cease as abruptly as they began then in the morning the amir would emerge from his tent give orders to the chief steward mount his horse and ride away leaving us to strike camp and move on to the next stopping place after we had been several days on the trail my presence ceased to be of interest to my erstwhile guards i was treated no more or less well than a dog or mule belonging to the camp if no one took any interest in my welfare neither did they show me cruelty or inflict needless torment they were not warriors after all but servants inexperienced in keeping prisoners and largely unaware of any pressing need to keep me bound or tethered in any way perhaps they reckoned escape unlikely as with nothing but empty desert wilderness stretching away in every direction there was no place for me to flee this was the unvarying pattern of the next eight or ten dayseach day so like the last that i lost count and simply drifted along until we came in sight of damascus i heard one of the arabs shout and the others began to chatter excitedly all at once i raised my head and saw the shimmering dazzle on the far horizon it was late in the day and the low sun set the high white stone walls glowing like kindled ivory or lustrous alabaster i wiped the sweat from my eyes and gazed on the glimmering city with a thrill of mingled excitement and alarm ahead lay the fate towards which i had been slowly moving for many days and i had no idea what to expect when we reached our destination rather than push on to the city the chief steward halted the caravan at a nearby well as the servants scurried to establish the camp i put down my burden and sat on the mud brick rim of the well to watch while the servants scurried to make ready to receive their lord i noticed that some greater care attended this evenings chores and it occurred to me that perhaps the amir was preparing to receive dignitaries from the city for once the amirs tent had been erected beneath the tall date palms the treasurewhich ordinarily remained packed and secured with the animals was unloaded and brought to the amirs tent this task finished the servants hastened to prepare the evening meal and i took the opportunity to doze awhile in the dying rays of the sun the chief steward must have caught sight of me sleeping and saw the carved box between my feet for i was roused with a sharp kick in my ribs and i woke to find him standing over me railing in arabic before he could kick me again i jumped to my feet whereupon he snatched up the box and thrust it into my arms still shouting he gestured towards the amirs tent and at last i understood that i was to take the box and put it with the rest of the treasure i obeyed as there was no one to take the box from meeveryone was busy with other chores and as the entrance flap was open i entered the tent myself the treasure had been dumped in a careless cascading heap i checked my first impulse to simply pitch the box onto the pile and walk away but fearing the square casket might come open and spill its grotesque contents i decided to take a moment and make a secure place for the box to rest i carefully pulled a few items from the haphazard hoarding and set them to one sidea golden bowl a ceremonial quiver containing four gilded arrows an alabaster chalice rimmed and footed with silver a pair of beaded silk shoes and so on this created a goodly space but as i bent to retrieve the box a few items from the top of the stack started to slide and i soon found myself pulling things from the heap in order to keep the entire mound from toppling one of the objects caught my attention as i picked it up black and heavy it looked like a thick oblong casket made of wood and very old less than the length of my forearm both ends were bound in heavy gold into which a number of rubies had been set each ruby was ringed with tiny pearls curiously i could see neither hinge nor hasp closer examination confirmed that there was no lid or opening of any kind further the wood was deeply grooved worn smooth and polished by much handling but dense and heavy still and hard as iron a strange feeling crept over me as i stood holding that short length of agedarkened timber and realized i had found the holiest treasure this side of heaven i had found the black rood my heart began to beat more quickly and i was overcome by a powerful urge to kneel down and cradle the strange object to my breast fearful of being discovered i quickly turned and made my way to the tent opening to see all the servants working away busily the camp steward was overseeing the preparation of the cooking fires and there was no one near the tent that i could see retreating into the tent once more i knelt down and picked up the relic and held it for a moment as one might hold an infant child like my father before me i had discovered the treasure of a lifetime carelessly stowed in an arab tent a prize of battle nothing more with no more meaning to those who captured it than the price of the gold and gems adorning its surface these thoughts were the realization of an instant and fleeting at that i knelt and embraced the holy object and reverenced it with eyes closed and a prayer of thanksgiving in my mouth strange to feel such an upwelling of emotion at the ordinary sight of this bulky chunk of old old wood truly there was no mystery or enchantment in its appearance yet there was mystery for as i knelt in the fading light of the open entrance i felt a quickening presence in the tent the still air suddenly seemed to seethe with an almost oppressive power my lungs laboured as if trying to breathe water my hands began to shake uncontrollably lest i drop the holy object i placed it on the carpeted floor before me and to keep my hands from trembling clasped them tightly together in prayer i am holding fast to god i prayed and he is holding fast to me i am holding fast to christ and he is holding fast to me i am holding fast to the spirit and he is holding fast to me the great king lord of heaven above and earth below holding fast to me i placed my trembling hands on the holy object and prayed hear your servant lord and master i stand ready to do your will do not let this sacred treasure pass from the world through ignorance or careless disregard my god and saviour let me redeem it from the hands of the unworthy who in their hateful pride and folly have disgraced defiled and demeaned your matchless gift the thought that the unclean hands of unbelievers should touch this sacred relic filled me with a great disgust i took up one of the many rugs which served as a floor for the tent and reverently and prayerfully wrapped the holy object in the rug and tied it with a braided cord i pulled from around a large jar containing pungent frankincense then in all reverence i carefully replaced the holy rood in amongst the other items of plunder rose and crept from the tent having found the object of my quest i did not want to allow my seljuq captors any reason for suspicion so i left the tent before i was discovered and returned to my place beside the well that night i lay awake gazing at the stars wheeling slowly overhead and thinking about the black rood i prayed over and over again that i might be accounted worthy to be the one to rescue it as i held this prayer in my mind i sensed the same quickening presence i felt in ghazis tenta curious sensation i once felt something like it in the woods when i suddenly became aware of someone or something watching me as i knelt beside a stream for a drink of water i slowly turned to see a large tufted wildcat crouched in a patch of sunlight a few dozen paces behind me sleek wild and powerful muscles twitching the magnificent creature stood with lowered head its golden eyes aflame with a fierce intensity as it observed this odd new kind of prey i had the same feeling nowas if i were being stalked by something of immense power grace and subtlety it had drawn near and fixed me in its burning gaze i looked across the silent camp to the amirs tent dark and shadowy against the starlit sky nothing in the camp moved there was no sound the next thing i knew i was on my feet moving towards the amirs tent the guards were asleep no one called out to stop me and then i was inside a small lamp hanging from the central post cast a gently wavering light over the mound of treasure with which the amir impressed his many guests i could hear the slow ebb and flow of the amirs breathing as he slept on his cushioned bed in the next room only the cloth partition separated us strangely i felt no fear of discovery although it would certainly have brought about immediate execution on the contrary i was bathed in a serenity of calm which gave me a feeling of fearless exultation as i set about gently shifting the various items of plunder in the amirs treasure trove in order to uncover the black rood i moved one object and then another and a few more and then the priceless relic lay before me great high king reveal your glory through your servant i whispered i said the first thing that came to mind only but as soon as the words touched my lips wonder of wonders the tent began to fade around meas if the fabric walls had become a thin gauzy stuff allowing me to see as through a veil all the camp around me yet it was not the camp i saw but a busy road leading to the walls of a great city as i tried to make sense in what i was seeing there arose a shout from the direction of the city i looked towards the towering walls and saw a crowd of people emerging from the wide open gates with a cry like that of hounds scenting blood this dark raging flood poured out from the city almost as swiftly as the dark storm clouds gathering in the dull yellow sky overhead the blueblack bulging heads and shoulders of mighty clouds boiled in the stifling desert air and away in the distance i could hear the low grumble of thunder there were others nearby standing beside the road waiting for the crowd to pass i quickly joined them to see what was happening the crowd came closer and soon reached the place where i was standing and i saw that they were driving some poor wretch before them prodding and shoving him along as they drew near i saw that his arms were tied to a roughhewn wooden beam and when he stumbled they hauled him up by yanking on the ends of the beam and once on his feet they drove him on the crowd soon reached the place where i stood but were so intent in the pursuit of their ambition they paid me no heed they were a murderous rabble it seemed to me dirty beggars street brawlers and cudgelmen for the most partalthough here and there amidst the bedraggled mob the glint of a gold ring a silver brooch or the high tapering crown of a wellmade hat gave me to know there were men of rank and power among themand also a handful of soldiers dressed in roman armour as they hastened by the prisoner stumbled and went down those foremost in the crowd snatched him upright again and the pain made him gasp with agony and i saw why the wretchs back was a sodden expanse of mutilated skin and muscle forming a massive raw gaping wound merciful god great tattered shreds of flesh hung from his shoulders ripped from his broad sturdy back by the wicked irontipped roman lash blood coursed freely down his sides staining his torn robe and spattering the dusty road with each jolting step he took but one more step and fell again they were on him in an instant kicking at him and shouting for him to get up two soldiers shoved into the throng and while one began pushing people away the other seized the end of the beam and untied the ropes binding the mans arms the crowd howled with rage and three more legionaries appeared and waded in forcing the rabble back with the shafts of their short spears one of the soldiers turned and seized a mana huge black ethiope on his way to the city and who like myself was merely standing alongside the road watching the fearful procession too frightened to resist the poor fellow was yanked into the wild maelstrom and pressed into service freed from the crushing burden of the beam the wounded prisoner made to rise he lifted his head and looked up his eyes met my gaze and my heart caught in my throat for i knew i looked into the battered face of gods own dear son thirtysix that oncenoble visage was bruised and bleeding the high handsome brow shattered and the straight fine nose broken a circlet cap had been woven of desert briar and the thorns jammed into his scalp blood trickled from the wounds mixing with the dust of the road to form muddy rivulets down his face his eyes as they beheld mine although filled with anguish were yet keen with intelligence and a burning volition that was all i hada single fleeting lookbut i swear all the grief and care of creation was in that painriven glance the crowd baying like crazed hounds urged him on the soldiers gabbed his arms and hauled him upright he was shoved on his way with the ethiope following behind dragging the heavy crossbeam and the ghastly retinue lurched along once more i stood for a moment too astonished and terrified to move and then before i knew it i was following the crowd surrounded by a large number of loudly wailing women and giddy excited children we continued down the road towards a curious humpshaped hill no great distance from the city walls the hill was topped by a rocky outcrop against which a large timberwork frame had been erected a small contingent of boredlooking legionaries sat waiting on the hillside near the road by the time i pushed my way to the front of the crowd i saw the lord christ standing with splendid dignity head erect struggling to remain upright while the crowd surged and seethed around him the soldiers wasted no time grabbing the crosspiece from the ethiope they dragged it up the hillside a few paces and threw it on the ground then laying hands on the condemned man they stripped off his clothes and pulled him up to the beam turned him around and pushed him down onto his bloody back he winced with pain but did not cry out one of the waiting legionaries a burly muscled hulk in a leather labourers apron rose and stepped quickly to the prisoner shirtless his big arms glistening he gave a nod of command and the prisoners right arm was stretched out and held down on the timber then kneeling on the condemned mans arm so as to hold it still he ground a splayed thumb into the hollow of the mans forearm just above the wrist and held it there for a moment with his other hand he reached into a pocket of his leather apron and drew out a thick iron spike which he placed where his thumb had been then with quick practised efficiency he reached behind him and took up a short heavy blacksmiths hammer the movement was so swift i did not see what was happening at first i saw the soldiers great arm rise with dread purpose and fall with a solid resonating crack in the same instant the lord jesus head jerked up eyes bulging mouth snatched open in a soundless scream of agony as the hard metal smashed through the flesh and tendons and veins of his wrist my heart trembled within me and i wanted to look awaybut i could not i watched clasping my hands together and murmuring helpless hopeless prayers bright blood welled up in a sudden crimson gush and the crowd roared its approval as two more mighty blows drove the cruel spike deep into the stout timber beamwhereupon the soldier rose stepped over his victim and repeated the procedure on the left arm three quick decisive blows rang like anvil peals driving the spike between the twin bones of the mans forearm and into the heavy wood no sooner had the last blow rung out than the soldiers passed ropes under the timber beam and secured the condemned mans arms at the elbows they then turned and began hauling the beam up the hill three soldiers at the end of each rope dragging their victim with it the ground was rough and rocky and christs poor wounded back left a bloody swathe in the pale bonedry dirt at the top of the hill they heaved the ropes over the upper beams of the timber framework the dangling ends were caught and passed to the legionaries beneath who with the help of a score or more of the more zealous members of the rabble eagerly seized the lines and pulled hard the ropes snapped taut jerking the suffering jesu from the ground up up he soared rising skyward the ropes singing over the rough timber until the crosspiece met the upper beam of the framework where it jarred to a stop leaving him suspended high above the crowd his arms pinioned to the heavy timber beam there the blessed christ swung writhing with the violence of his crude ascent the crosspiece was quickly lashed to the upper beam of the framework and therehis gentle healing hands twisted and deformed into the shape of clawshe hung high above the ground he hung blood coursing in rivulets down his arms and sides mingling with the muddy sweat of his torment stretched between earth and sky the holy one of god hung the weight of his broken body dangling from his strong arms meanwhile two other unfortunatesthieves caught in the act were likewise crucified and strung up either side of him as soon as the two wretches were secured the soldiers produced a long beam part of the trunk of a tree and lashed it tight to the uprights just below the knees of the hanging men the big roman then proceeded to drive spikes through the victims anklebones fixing them to the lower beam the two thieves screamed and thrashed in their agony while the mob jeered and applauded unable to bear the torment any longer jesu opened his mouth and screamed eloi the cords stood out on his neck with the force of his shout eloi the mob fell back at the fearful power of the cry they looked at one another and murmured he is calling on elijah someone said no wait said another he is calling on god to save him he saved others scoffed one big brute merrily now let him save himself quiet he is speaking shouted a man near the front i cannot hear what he is saying here give him a drink and maybe he will speak again a sop of wine was raised on the end of a stick and held to his mouth but jesu bowed his head and said no more a group of elder jews arrived from the city just then there were perhaps a dozen or so some dressed in priestly garb others in costly red robes with chains of gold around their necks gathering up their long cloaks to keep them from the dust they mounted the side of the hill and pushed their way to the front of the throng their expressions smug and hard they took their places at the front of the mob and stood like monuments of selfrighteous reprisal glaring up at the dying man the romans having completed their duties now turned to other amusements they had some bread and wine with them and sat down a little apart to eat and drink while they waited for the execution to reach its fatal and inevitable conclusion the crowd continued their crude harangue of the dying men mocking them laughing at their misery as they tried to keep the weight of their bodies off their pinioned ankles while at the same time relieve the searing torment of their arms some of the older youths thought it good sport to pelt the condemned with rocks which they did with increasing impunity indeed one young thug made a lucky throw striking one of the thieves full in the face smashing his cheekbone and knocking out the mans eye the poor wretch moaned and tossed his head back and forth the mangled eye dangling and bouncing on his crushed cheek much to the delight of the jeering throng this emboldened the rest who redoubled their efforts and i believe the condemned might have been stoned to death on the crosstrees if not for a careless throw which struck the beam and careened into the party of roman soldiers who having finished their meal were now playing at dice for the prisoners clothes and sandals the stone struck one of the legionaries on the leg and up he came he charged into the boys with drawn sword walloping one or two of the pluckier ruffians with the flat of his blade they howled like scalded pups and the whole pack fled a strange calm descended on the humpbacked hill then as the crowd settled down to wait the sky grew darker the dreadful yellow turning greengrey like a diseased wound and the air already still became stifling the only sound to be heard was the desperate wheezing and gasping of the men on the gibbet as they struggled to get air into their lungs though all three looked as if they were past caring life clung on and would not abandon them the mob quickly grew bored with the tedious display and became restless soon the crowd was thinning at the edges as the less fervid having had their fill began to creep away quietly leaving the hardened zealots to their gloating about this time a roman commander arrived on horseback he sat for a moment taking in the spectacle and then called a command to the soldiers lolling on the ground i could not make out what was said for i was on the hillside and the centurion remained on the road but two of the legionaries jumped to their feet and hastened off to where some of their tools and gear were lying on the ground one of the soldiers reached for the ladder and the other a hammer and flat piece of wood which were lying there resting the top of the ladder against the upper crossbeam the first soldier climbed up while the other standing below handed up the hammer and wood the first soldier then proceeded to nail the wooden placard to the upper beam next to jesus head there was so far as i could see nothing written on the placard but this oversight was soon corrected for the commander spoke again and the legionary on the ground bent down and picked up a stick broke off one end and passed it to his friend on the ladder the soldier took the stick and holding it to the body of the hanging man dabbed the broken end in his freely trickling blood he then proceeded to write in ragged red letters these words lesu nazarethaei rex ludae seeing this the crowd instantly sent up an appalling shriek the priests and elders standing proudly at the forefront of the crowd flew into a foul rage wailing and tearing at their clothes and beards two of the jewish leaders hastened down to where the centurion sat on his horse watching the commotion with a bemused expression please hear us sir the senior of the two cried that man is not the king of the jews we have no king but caesar added the other some of those on the hillside took up the reply as a chant we have no king but caesar they shouted halfheartedly a whitehaired man in priests robes joined the two the sign is an offence to our people he insisted we beg you lord take it down the centurion enjoying the uproar he had provoked with his innocent order gazed with unruffled merriment at the three and shook his head slowly my lord the old priest pleaded it is an abomination and a stench in the nostrils of god please remove the sign at once still shaking his head the commander replied it stays if it cannot be removed one of the other elders suggested adopting a reasonable tone then perhaps it could be made to read this nazarene claimed to be king of the jews at that moment one of the ruffians in the crowd darted out from among the throng before anyone could stop him he ran to the ladder and climbed up almost knocking the legionary from his perch as he tried to grab hold of the sign and tear it down the centurion lashed his mount forwards up the hill to the ladder and reaching out seized the rascal by the leg and pulled him from the ladder the man rolled on the ground yelling and fuming and the priests and elders quickly gathered around pleading with the soldiers to take down the sign and restore the peace but the roman commander growing tired of their sanctimonious bleating refused to be drawn into the affray he ordered soldiers to remove the man who had tried to tear down the sign and as they dragged him aside the sky gave forth a low worrisome growl a sharp gust of wind sent the dust swirling around the hilltop the commander raised his eyes skyward and then as the first fat drops of rain spattered into the dust he decided that it was time to disperse the crowds before the situation deteriorated further turning to his cohort he gave the final command finish it taking up his hammer once more the big roman stepped to the nearest of the victims and with a mighty swing hurled the flat of the hammer into the mans leg halfway between knee and ankle the shinbone cracked with a dull sickening cruncha sound so appalling it even made the bloodlusting crowd wince the suffering wretch screamed in agony and passed out the legionary applied the hammer to the other leg and the unconscious man slumped down hard the weight of his body tearing his arms from their sockets as his legs folded neatly in half he gave a strangled sigh choked on his tongue and expired the executioner moved on to the next thief who was yet aware enough to know what was about to take place he began pleading and crying to be spared but the soldier took no heed breaking both the mans legs with as many blows of the hammer the second victim was not so lucky as the first he did not pass out but screamed and writhed in agony as he kept trying to raise himself up on his ruined legs so as to fill his lungs with air he jerked and twitched pitifully the sharp shards of shinbone poking through the flesh of his damaged limbs each movement bringing fresh torture as the ragged ends of his shattered bones gnashed and splintered like broken teeth turning his attention to the last victim the big roman swung his hammer wide but withheld the blow at the last instant looking up into the face of the hanging man he said this one is dead the watching elders heard this and raised an outcry at once how can it be they demanded it is not yet evening he is not dead someone shouted he has only swooned one of the elders dressed in red robes and wearing a heavy chain of gold around his neck stepped forwards see here centurion he said in educated latin the people are right he has only swooned revive him and you will see the executioner heard this and grew angry do you call me liar he snarled by no means said the elder raising his hands as if to fend off a blow but this jesu was known to be a sorcerer and a magician he may be using his powers to feign death do not be deceived rather do your duty i know my duty growled the big roman moving nearer just as i know a dead man when i see one hefting the hammer in his hand he said maybe you would like to join him in hadesor wherever it is you people go the wealthy elder gave a yelp and backed away the executioner made as if to pursue him into the crowd but the centurion called him back longinus enough we will prove it to them he said casting an eye to the gathering storm then maybe we can get back to the city before were soaked to the bone the big roman abandoned his pursuit and returned to the foot of the framework taking his spear he raised it to the anointed ones side and thrust it up hard beneath his ribs in the centre of his chest watery blood burst from the wound gushing in a pale fountain all at once there was neither movement nor outcry from the victim and i knew i looked upon a corpse at that moment there came a great peal of thunder and the storm broke with a force to shake the very earth a cold wind whirled around the hilltop whining like an animal in pain and kicking up prodigious clouds of dust and dirt seeing that the condemned men were dead the crowd retreated streaming back to the city throwing their cloaks over their heads as they ran the romans quickly gathered up their weapons and followed the throng back to the city leaving two of their number behind to keep watch the rain came hard and fast pelting down in stinging sheets i looked around expecting to find myself alone on the hillside but was surprised to discover a small miserable knot of peoplewomen mostlystanding a little apart they were weeping and clinging to one another oblivious to the storm crashing around them the wind howled like a wounded animal lightning flashed and rolling blasts of thunder shook the ground as if to crack the very walls of jerusalem the rain pitched down in great lashing waves as if the bruised sky had ruptured spilling out its waters all at once the dry hillside slowly dissolved into a sticky quagmire despite the savage blast i waited to see what would happen and in a little while the storm which had blown up so quickly passed the same way the thunder stopped and the wind calmed the air refreshed from the cooling rain smelled wonderfully of spices and rare desert flowers the dead men their corpses washed hung dripping from their crosspieces clean now and ready for burial above the sound of the wailing women i heard someone calling from the road below i turned to see a young darkbearded man in a fine yellow cloak hastening towards the hill and hailing the little knot of mourners as he came some distance behind him came a man leading a donkey and cart i do not know if either of them had been present at the execution but the young man quickly mounted the hillside and joined the group they held a brief discussion whereupon he stepped out from among them and approached the timber frame the two soldiers who had been huddling in the shelter of the rocks stepped forwards and demanded to know the mans business he replied speaking in good latin and said that he had come for the body of jesu it is growing late he explained the sabbath begins at sunset we must remove the body before the sun sets for it is against the law to bury a man on the sabbath likewise it is an abomination to leave the dead unburied the young soldier frowned we were told nothing about this you must get permission from the governor please the young man said there is no time indicating the bundle under his arm he said i have brought the shroud and i will happily take full responsibility for the burial reaching into his belt he brought out several pieces of silver which he passed to the soldier this is for your trouble i will need your help to get him down the second soldier looked at the money and nudged his more reluctant comrade very well the legionary agreed at last you can have all three of them for all i care the young man called to the waiting mourners still clustered together sobbing quietly and two men came out from among them to help the romans put up the ladder and one of them ascended with drawn sword preparing to hack off the hands of the dead man no please no cried the young man you must not mutilate the body the legionary grimaced i thought you were in a hurry friend hefting the broad blade a clean chopit is the best way he wont feel a thing added the other soldier helpfully hes dead as dung pointing to the group of women now standing below the body the young man said please for his mothers sake let us preserve what little dignity remains the soldier shrugged and proceeded to hack at the rope binding the crosspiece to the upper framework one side gave way and the body slewed sideways leaning across the corpse he cut the other rope and the body pitched forwards still attached to the rood piece those on the ground caught the blessed body of our lord and bore it up while the second legionary raised a massive pair of iron tongs and proceeded to nip the head from the spike through the corpses ankles it was difficult work and the young jew continually urged the soldiers to use as much care as possible before it was over all of the mourners were needed to help support the body so as to prevent it breaking off at the feet but at last the legionary succeeded in freeing the corpse and they laid the inert body of the lord jesu gently on the wet ground next the legionary went to work on the spikes holding the dead mans arms to the crossbeam using the huge tongs he gnawed and worried the beaten heads from the iron nails and all the while the young man pressed him to hurry as it was growing late the soldier grew angry do you want it fast or do you want it clean he demanded which is it joseph said one of the women gently she was younger than the others long dark hair spilled out from bekeath the hood of her cloak do not anger the man he is only trying to help her voice was a warm balm of comfort poured out to soothe the cold cruel hurt of the day miriam we must he started to object but she silenced him with a smile of such sweet sadness it cleft my heart to see it please joseph it will be all right there is no hurry anymore very well the wealthy young man relented to the legionary he said take your time my friend the soldier glancing at the woman with something more than benign interest resumed his work eventually freeing the right wrist and then the left the women carefully spread the woven linen shroud on the ground and the body of heavens fairest son was laid upon it the men watched while the women carefully arranged the torn limbs and smoothed back the tangled hair murmuring a low litany of psalms the while then they folded the shroud over the body and secured it with broad bands around the neck and chest and feet thanking the roman soldiers the men took up the body and carried it down the hillside to the cart which was now waiting on the road they placed the body of the saviour in the cart and then began the long slow journey back to the city the soldiers divided the money between them and with a last glance at the two dead thieves shouldered their spears and departed who do you think he was i heard one of them ask as they started off down the hill it hardly matters replied the other one jew is the same as another theyre all alike these jewszealots madmen and murderers they moved off and i found myself alone on the hillside staring at the crossbeam which had been left lying on the ground the headless spikes where the blessed saviours arms had been pierced the stain of his blood deep in the grain of the roughhewn wood i knelt and placed my hand reverently on the rood and felt the coarse unforgiving weight hard beneath my palm i heard voices behind me and thinking the legionaries had returned i glanced quickly over my shoulder and saw myself asleep on the ground beside a well instantly i was back in amir ghazis camp the moon was down and the stars were fading with the first pale hint of dawn showing in the east and i was in my place beside the well once more i rose the camp was quiet nothing had changed had i crept into the amirs tent or had i fallen asleep and dreamed it it did not matter i knew beyond all uncertainty that i had received a vision of rare and special power my hands and face tingled and the ground felt thin as water beneath my feet my body began to tremblenot with fear or foreboding but with a ferocious ecstasy i felt like running and leaping and crying to the stardusted heavens in praise and thanksgiving to my generous creator for the wonderful vision i had been granted it was all i could do to keep from laughing out loud and waking all the camp so i lay beside the well exhilarated shaking with jubilation joy coursing like liquid fire through my veins pure elation bubbling up like a wellspring filled not with water but with sweet heady wine as dawn broke full and glorious in the east i got up and knelt raising my face to the sun and stretching my arms wide i pledged a solemn vow within my heart that whatever should befall me in the days to come i would strive above all things to acquit myself with the same humility strength and courage i had witnessed in jesus death so that i might be worthy of my redeemers sacrifice part iii november paphos cyprus professor manos rossides lived in the bottom floor of a tiny townhouse a violin teacher had the upper floors and there was a violin and cello duet wafting down the stairwell as i stood before the sombre brown door in the semidarkness waiting for my expectant host to answer the bell i yanked the bellpull again waited some more and was just about to give up and go home when i heard a shuffling sound on the other side presently a key clicked in the lock and the door opened onto a small dark man with a heavy beetling brow hooded eyes and an unruly mass of thick wavy dark hair which stood out from his head in all directions it put me in mind of a storm at sea and it was all i could do to tear my eyes from the startling sight and say professor rossides i am gordon murray i was given to understand you would be expecting me at the sound of my name the mans sleepy countenance sparked to life quite right sir right on time he smiled and his dark eyes became keen and his features boyish and winsome do come in mr murray he took my coat and waved me to a chair at a spindlelegged table piled dangerously high with books and papers a brass lamp with a green glass shade hung over the table illuminating the stacks of printed matter like upland plateaux in the glare of the summer sun time is precious he announced we begin at once with that he began reciting the greek alphabet drifting around the room behind me pounding his fist into the palm of his outstretched hand as he enunciated each letter after two more recitations he had me doing it we worked steadily for ninety minutes and just as i was beginning to get the feel of the unfamiliar words in my mouth he called the lesson to a halt excellent excellent he cried beaming at me as if at a prize heifer you are a natural scholar mr murray together we will achieve the impossible i will be content with the merely passable i told him he laughed shaking his head dear me no well have none of that you are too able and too clever to settle for second best no my friend when we are finished you will be able to sit in aphrodites taverna on the waterfront in rhodes and talk politics with the fishermen oh i said rising to retrieve my coat is that all i rather thought i might indulge in a bit of lecturing on platos symposium tut sir the professor chided his eyes wrinkling with mirth i said we should achieve the impossiblenot perform miracles thus began my short but intensive apprenticeship in conversational greek my tutor sent me home with two books that nightone greek the other latinboth of which i was to have read by my next visit the following week i do not know how he crammed so much expert instruction into our alltooshort sessions but as the weeks went by i found my mastery growing by leaps and bounds nagging little foibles and difficulties that had plagued me since college evaporated in the blistering heat of the professors searing searching intellect summer came and went and as autumn rolled on apace i began to think ahead to what might await me at the end of september the answer to this came on my last visit to professor rossides study actually i did not know it was my final visit until my assiduous mentor reached over to the text i was reading and closed the book perfect he declared our work together is completed how can it be finished i feel as if i have only begun oh indeed and i congratulate you on a most auspicious beginning but my assignment was to enable you to speak and write well enough to make yourself understood and you have achieved that and more i shall be making my report to your colleagues shortly well done mr murray i bade him farewell and left feeling slightly saddened by the prospect that i would no longer have the enjoyment of his intensely stimulating lessons this feeling lasted until the middle of the next week when i once again received a visit from pemberton and zaccaria they turned up just before the office closed for the day and with evident pleasure pronounced the completion of my assignment satisfactory in every way we knew you would take to your studies zaccaria confided it was a most gratifying experience i must say i enjoyed it very much be that as it may said pemberton withdrawing a long white envelope from the inner pocket of his coat i think you will enjoy employing your new skills even more he passed he envelope to me and indicated that i was to open it i lifted the flap reached in and pulled out two steamer tickets one for my wife and one for myself with the destination listed as paphos cyprus as you see the ship sails two weeks from today he said that should give you time enough to arrange your affairs i should think six weeks in cyprus i mused reading the return portion of the ticket yes i think caitlin and i could do very well with that thank you very much i do not anticipate any problems arising from your legal work the way he said it i could not tell if it was a question or an observation of fact in any case i suspected any genuine obstacles would have been foreseen and removed none at all i replied as it happens this time of year is normally very quiet i can have one of my juniors keep an eye on things while i am gone splendid thus the arrangements were firmly in place all i had to do was pack and get myself and the good wife to the steamer on timea task which somehow expanded to fill every available moment even as caitlin filled every available case and trunk it was not until the ship loosed its moorings and steamed for cyprus that i realized not a single word had been said about what i would do when i got there more mystery was awaiting me on the landing at paphos harbour in the form of the jovial mr melos who stood on the wharf in his best blue suit holding a card with my last name written on it his dark hair was oiled and combed and the lower part of his face was covered by threeday old stubble he grinned and waved when he saw us and came bounding across the landing to shake our hands whats this wondered caitlin charmed by the mans eagerness to please you didnt tell me we were to be chaperoned darling it is nonstop adventure start to finish i said our greeter introduced himself and i understood at once why i had sweated and strained through the summer to learn the language mr melos spoke no english nevertheless i was quickly to learn that he was the most expert and knowledgeable guide imaginable he was an archaeologist who had spent his entire career digging on the island there was nothing about cyprus or its history he did not know he also ran a small private museum with a guest house next door both of which he had filled with mementos from his various digs the more valuable specimens go off to museums around the world he said when he showed us through his rooms one day but the smaller pieces the duplicates i keep we spent the first few days in mr melos able care the sole tenants in his guest house caitlin fell instantly in love with the place and proclaimed that it was high time i had brought her someplace nice and furthermore she was never leaving that first day we ate a light meal and waited for our luggage to arrive which it did by donkey cart towards evening by then we were already feeling ourselves slipping into what caitlin called cyprus timethe pace at which things happened or didnt according to the whims and preoccupations of the locals the reason for my adventure remained obscure and i had begun to wonder whether i ought to say something about it when mr melos appeared as we were having breakfast one morning he presented me with a letter which had arrived some little while previously i suspect it was from zaccaria and it contained the purpose of my visit as soon as we were rested from our journey we were to make our way to a certain monastery in the hills i will take you said melos when i asked him where it was i know this place very well leave everything to me it is all arranged later that same morning we gathered our things and proceeded by carriage up into the foothills of the troodos mountains to the little village of panayia where a cottage had been hired for us we arrived near dusk and melos took us to our cottage and introduced us to our housekeepera sister of his named helena a small plump woman of mature years who chattered like a mynah bird whether anyone was listening or not she had a meal ready for us when we arrived showed us where to find everything and then left us to eat and sleep in peace we spent a wonderful first night in our little cottage dining by candlelight with the windows open onto the courtyard where late roses were still in bloom the next morning our inestimable host collected us and took us to the monastery ayios moni is a very ancient place he said the monks there maintain a library of many priceless manuscripts it was of course these manuscripts that i had come to see rather it was one manuscript in particular upon our arrival we were introduced to the bishop who conducted us on a tour of the small but tidy monastery which was now home to fewer than thirty monks at the end of the tour he said i suppose you will be wanting to get started to tell you the truth i replied silently thanking rossides for my newfound fluency i would like nothing better unfortunately i do not know precisely why i have come bald bishop naxos laughed and said you have come to view the caithness manuscript caithness said caitlin when i had told her what the bishop had said you mean the caithness in scotland havent the foggiest he led us to the library where a few monks were working away hunched silently over old vellums and parchments he spoke a few words to the brother in charge of the collection and the blackrobed monk disappeared into the stacks returning a few moments later with a weighty bundle wrapped in heavy homespun linen behold said bishop naxos one of our orders prize possessions he directed brother nicholas to a nearby table beneath a window and there the monk opened the parcel the ink is faded and there are a few water spotswe had a bad storm in the fifteenth century and the roof leaked still it is in remarkable condition for a document which was written in i translated the priests words for caitlin who marvelled at the age of the venerable manuscript he passed his hand lovingly over the bundle of parchment and fingered the silk cord which bound the bundle together this will be the last time the manuscript is seen in the place where it was created i think it highly appropriate that you should be the reader he regarded me meaningfully but the reference was lost on me i do not understand i said next month it is going into a vault at the ministry of antiquities in athens he explained but before i could tell him that this was not what i meant he added it is felt by my superiors at khyrsorroyiatissa that our order can no longer protect it adequately nonsense grumbled melos sourly we have it for a little while yet he smiled sadly and pulled a chair from the table please sit we would be honoured for you to be our guest for as long as you like again i understood that he was according me a special favour but his meaning remained beyond my comprehension i told caitlin what he had said and asked if she minded very much amusing herself for awhile go on with you she said and dont be silly of course i dont mind i can well look after myself for a few days so with the blessing of both bishop and wife i settled myself into the chair i was to occupy for a good many days when the others had gone i loosened the silken cord and turned back the battered old covering the script diat met my eye was strong and fair the rich black tone had faded to a pale reddish sepia but remained clearly legible i read the first words and knew why i had been summoned to this task my heart began to beat with such force i thought i would have to abandon the work before i had even begun before me on the table was the account of murdos son duncan and in his own words a record of his pilgrimage in the holy land thirtyseven amir ghazis arrival in damascus was hailed as the triumphal entry of a conquering hero he massed his army on the wide plain outside the city walls and then proceeded to lead his victorious troops and their wretched captives into the city the wily amir spared no pomp in making his entrance as impressive as possible drummers went before the amir and his bodyguard pounding out dull thunder children ran beside the amirs horse scattering flower petals trumpeters blew shrill blasts to part the crowds who stood and gaped at the passing spectacle we marched through the streets to the citadel where atabeg buri and all the officials and dignitaries met the grand cavalcade in the courtyard of the rose pavillion proud ghazi made a great show of displaying his prize captives the prisoners were paraded before a double rank of noble arabs some on small cushioned stools and some on thrones and made to bow before them in a show of subservient humiliation i who had carried bohemonds head on my back was forced to display the ghastly prize to the arabs summoned from the foreranks of the captives i was marched before the seljuqs and saracens as they sat in festal splendour enjoying the subjugation of their hated foe two guards led me to the foot of the low rise of steps leading up to the perfumed pavilion and at ghazis direction i was commanded to open the box the arab noblemen laughed to see the mighty prince and bane of their people disgraced in death one of the arabs however did not laugh with the others dressed in opulent robes that glowed with the iridescent blues and greens of peacock feathers and wearing a huge blue turban he observed the christian princes shame with a rapt and thoughtful expression at the height of the mirth he beckoned atabeg buri nearer and spoke privately to him for some time meanwhile i stood and held the open box for the delight and delectation of the others hating the display and my part in it when the two finished their conversation buri invited amir ghazi to join them the amir advanced and was presented to the stranger in the blue turban whereupon he immediately fell to his knees and pressed the noblemans hand to his forehead the arab potentate endured the fawning servility of the amir with cool aplomb and to my great chagrin raised his hand and pointed directly at me ghazi jumped up and with an ostentatious flourish of his arm waved me forwards accompanied by the guards i was led to the pavilion steps and there made to kneel holding the box while the strutting amir presented the resplendent onlooker with the gift of bohemonds head why he should want the grotesque thing i could not say but the bestowing of it filled old flatfaced ghazi with a rare elation his rough and weathered visage cracked wide in a grin of exaltation and in a fit of largesse he lavished the whole of his trove upon his obviously superior overlord the objects of gold and silver the saddles weapons and armour the horses and all the rest he had accumulatedincluding the prisoners yes and myself as well although i guessed what was happening at the time i did not learn until much later that day the identity of the glittering luminary who was to be my new master it was sahak the armenian scribe and advisor who told me and took great delight in the telling you belong to the caliph of baghdad now he said unable to suppress a wicked smile at what he imagined would be distressing news to me but that is impossible i cried my reaction gave him great satisfaction and his hairless jowls jiggled with mirth in truth i was not dismayed in the least as i say i had already worked out what had happened and concluded that it did not greatly matter who held the end of my chain so to speak just so long as i remained close to the black rood still i had wit enough to adopt a woeful demeanour in order to find out all i could of my new master for i knew if sahak thought the information would benefit me in some way he would doubtless have withheld it out of sheer meanness so making a pretence of consternation i seized his sleeve and clung to him in desperation what will happen to me who can say delighting in his power over me he said but since you ask i expect you will be killed no i gasped i have done nothing my friends i said gripping him harder they will ransom me so you say he shook my hand from his arm but they have not come for you have they if i were you i would forget about being ransomed your friends have forgotten you they would never do that i shouted my agitation increasing his merriment they have given you up he maintained or else they would have come for you if they wanted to ransom you they would have done so long since they will come i insisted the caliph of baghdad you say i cannot go with him you must speak to amir ghazi you must beg him to let me stay in damascus where my friends can find me you must tell him sahak you are my only hope oh rest assured i will do what i can he told me the keen light of treason in his eyes thank you sahak thank you i said knowing full well that now i would remain with the caliph and within reach of the black rood the deceitful katib scuttled away and i watched him goa thoroughly detestable fellow to be sure but he had his uses i returned to the corner of my cell and reflected on how even the wicked were not beyond the reach of the swift sure hand who employed all things as he would to bring about his purposes for following the triumphal entry and amir ghazis rash fit of generosity my fellow captives and i were taken to the stinking vermin infested prison of amir buri damascus preening potentate to await the pleasure of our master the caliph in all it was not so bad for us and now that i could be assured of remaining near the holy rood i was content the stench i could tolerate after endless hot days in the scorching sun the cool damp darkness of the dungeons was blessed relief itself but the rats and mice were a very plague and no one dared fall asleep at night for the instant a body drifted off the rats would be on him gnawing at any exposed flesh several men lost the tips of fingers and toes before learning to sleep in the day when the vermin were less active besides the three noblemen there were other christians imprisoned with me those crusaders who had survived the battle and ensuing journey from anazarbus had also been made to walk in the grand procession in order to enhance the golden lustre of ghazis glory girardus was among the survivors but i could not speak to him for i was held in a cell by myself apart from the others the reason i eventually discovered was that the christians blamed me for bohemonds defeat word had spread through the prisoner ranks that i was the spy who had betrayed them to the seljuqs the loss of their comrades and their subsequent imprisonment and slavery was my fault and more than one of them had vowed to kill me the moment the opportunity presented itself my friend girardus might have told them otherwise and perhaps he tried but if he did they paid him no heed i suppose they needed someone to bear the blame for all the hardship bohemond was deadand his closest advisors and commanders with him and so the surviving captives fastened on me as the source of their troubles i suppose i deserved their condemnationalbeit of all those who had a hand in the illfated enterprise i was the only one who had in no way intended for anyone to be killed but what did that matter if i had not allowed myself to be drawn into the affair the massacre would not have happened bohemond would have taken anazarbus and that would have been the end of it the armenians would probably have been slaughtered in great numbers true butas i was continually and forcibly remindedlife held but slight value in the east the destinies of entire nations were bought and sold for a moments fleeting glory a few pieces of silver or the low ambitions of a prince too late i began to understand how murdo felt about the holy land and why over the next few days i set about trying to find out what manner of man the caliph of baghdad might be using the pretence of bargaining to remain in damascus the slimy sahak came and went enjoying his imagined treachery to the full while i remained supplied with morsels of worthwhile information i learned that aside from being the most powerful ruler in the region the caliph of baghdad was regarded as an able and thoughtful ruler who valued wisdom and studied the elusive art of philosophy at a school of his own creation a very religious man he was a devout muhammedan who lectured to students from the arab holy book the quran he was renowned as an authority in the application of the abstruse principles of islamic justice once i got sahak talking i could always count on learning something to my favour for the small price of enduring his vanity and sneers i soon gained a fair working knowledge of the caliphs character this stood me in good stead a few days later when i was called into his presence having received ghazis gift the caliph had decided to determine its value accordingly he ordered the prisoners to be brought before him as none of them could speak arabic the duty of translating between the caliph and the captives fell to sahak i was given no warning three seljuq guards appeared at the door to my cell two days after the amirs grand entry and i was taken up to the guardroom above the prison cells there i was given water with which to wash and a comb for my hair and beard having cleaned myself as well as i could i was then led by a long and circuitous route through the palace and citadel to the place where the caliph was holding court and i was instructed by a royal functionary on how to address him and how to behave in his illustrious presence upon receiving my assurance that i understood what was expected of me i was admitted without ceremony sahak was there ready to speak for me and for the caliph upon performing the necessary obeisance i was allowed to stand in his presence and speak freely a mature man of youthful appearance he had put off his ceremonial robes and all the glittery trappings of his rank including the bulbous turban so favoured by the arab race and wore a simple dark garment like a long tunic with a silver crescent moon on a chain around his neck he observed me silently for a moment tapping his fingers gently on the arms of his chair i am told you are a nobleman he said when i offered my affirmation he asked what is the country of your birth my home is in caithness lord khalifa i could tell he had never heard of this place so i added it is a region in the northern part of the island of britain the light of understanding came up in his eyes that is very far away i believe why have you come here was it to seek your fortune in the pillage of the arab landsan enterprise which seems to inflame so many of the franj by no means my lord i was on pilgrimage i said and made certain that sahak said the right word before continuing and was captured by mistake that is indeed unfortunate he replied without apparent concern many things happen in warall of them are unfortunate for someone you must agree the amir has set the price of your freedom at ten thousand dinars that is a large sum of money i agreed that it was do you have any hope of ransom assuredly most exalted khalifa i declared with confidence ignoring sahaks smirk even now my friends are hastening to damascus to purchase my freedom as he seemed interested in this i went on to explain about how we had been staying in anazarbus when the battle began and how i had come to be captured he listened to all i had to say and then replied your fellow hostages denounce you as a traitor and a spy he watched me intently to see how i would respond to this accusation i am aware of their feelings i answered reasonably without hesitation or emotion they are right to feel themselves aggrieved for what has happened to them but i am not to blame i see yet this unfortunate indictment persists as you have said wise khalifa many unfortunate things happen in war caliph almutarshid smiled at this he laced his fingers and looked at me over his fingertips tell me then who would you hold to blame amir ghazi prince thoros no my lord khalifa these men merely acted according to the circumstances forced upon them if the prisoners seek to apportion blame i would look to the count of antioch who led them into such a disastrous trap without provocation and without sufficient forethought the count is dead is he not i believe i have received his head in a box as a memento of the conflict in which he fell therefore he can no longer be held accountable that is true neither can he affirm or deny the charges made against you perhaps not i allowed yet forgive my presumption lord khalifa but if i am accused of being a traitor by my fellow christians then it follows that i have been in service to the seljuq cause if you believe this why am i still a prisoner the caliphs mouth tightened his eyes narrowed slightly you are not i think the innocent you claim to be he remarked abruptly lifting his hand he summoned the guards to take me away saying i will ponder this matter and we will speak of it further he signalled to the guards and i was returned to my cell unable to resist rubbing salt in the wounds he imagined me to be feeling sahak came to see me later that day not wise he said wagging his finger in my face to anger the khalifa he believes himself a logician and philosopher of great skill and proficiency it does you no good to better him on the field he has marked as his own i did not mean to challenge him i replied i merely hoped that as a man of wisdom he might see the sense of what i said and take that into account when assessing my position sahak laughed and went away shaking his head that is how i learned of my error and determined not to make the same mistake again alas the damage was done the next day the guards came for me and i was once again brought before almutarshid this time he was delivering his shrewd and perceptive judgements before the assembled counsellors advisors and liegemen of his retinue he wanted his minions to marvel at his renowned sagacity and was in no mood to be amused i have considered all that you have told me he announced as i took my place before him and i have concluded that you are a spy of the most dangerous variety he who is without loyalty and subject to no lord but himself therefore i have decided that you will remain a prisoner it was a mistake i asserted i should never have been brought here yet here you are the caliph said qismah all is as allah wills it so to be there is no such thing as a mistake if you are a captive it is because that is what allah intended who is wise enough to instruct god he gazed around gathering the admiring glances of his retinue then said you will remain a prisoner this pronouncement delighted sahak my faithless interpreter it was all he could do to suppress his glee but the next declaration jolted even sahak regarding me coldly the caliph said what is more if no one conies forwards to arrange your ransom in three days time you will be executed in the name of allah this is my decree i was in no way prepared for this decision my thoughts instantly scattered far and wide i thought of you gait and all i had left back home of padraig arriving too late and finding my lifeless body hanging from the city walls of sydoni weeping over my grave so many strange thoughts raced through my head that it took me a moment to recollect myself my lord khalifa i said trying to remain calm in the face of such an illogical and unjust pronouncement i do not know why my friends have not come for me i can assure you the ransom will be paid however three days is not enough time it is a long way from anazarbus to damascus they could have come for you any time since your capture but they have not the caliph pointed out i suspect they are not coming that these friends of yours are merely a ruse to prolong your duplicitous existence and that it is pointless keeping you alive three days he declared no more the assembled onlookers murmured their approval at the caliphs display of judicial firmness steadying my voice to present a brave face i replied then as a nobleman i beg the wise khalifas indulgence to honour a last request the idea sparked almutarshids interest i think he had not expected me to think of that within reason of course he said what is your last request i would like to leave a message for my family at home in scotland so that they will know what happened to me it was a simple thing but possessed of a certain nobility and i could see almutarshid found the idea appealing very well he agreed you shall write your message he looked at me with thoughtful curiosity how in the name of the prophet peace be unto him do you expect this letter of yours to reach your family exalted lord i replied it is not beyond your power to command such a thing to be done many pilgrims return to the west after their pilgrimage is completed no doubt one of them would consent to take the message it will be done the caliph said and the audience was concluded amazed that he should have agreed so easily i thanked him for his compassion and generosity and was taken back to my cell knowing the arab mind a little better now i see i had obligated him with my request and he could not possibly refusewithout appearing a weak and arbitrary ruler in front of his advisors and liegemen as he had so carefully cultivated himself as a fount of wisdom and learning among his people he could not allow himself to appear less noble than the insignificant wretch he had just condemned thus i won the boon i asked had i known it would be that easy gait i might have asked for something of greater consequence still i was content the guards marched me back to my cell where i spent the rest of the day and night praying that i might live long enough to fulfil my pilgrimage vow and recover the black rood the next morning sahak appeared with a small square of parchment a pot of ink and a supply of quillsa gift of the caliph he said for my letter i was happy to have these things and i told sahak to thank the caliph for supplying them he will kill you as he said the katib told me unhappily it was no idle threat i told him that no i did not imagine that the great caliph was in the habit of making idle threats to impress the prisoners with his power i shall be sorry to see you die sahak said why you have never liked me there have been many times when you might have spoken up for me yet you have not done soand i the man who helped save your people from bohemonds attack i let him have the full brunt of my anger and exasperation you might have done it out of charity for a fellow christian if nothing else the miserable scribe hung his head it is true he simpered but there is more you do not know yes he hesitated drawing his sleeve across damp eyes the brooch i stared at him a sick feeling beginning to spread through me what about it unable to look me in the eye he lowered his head still further i did not send it back to anazarbus he muttered then overcome by the enormity of his guilt he turned and hurried away before i could call down heavenly wrath upon his worthless hide i sat down and thought long and hard about what he had told me after the first storm of fury subsided i began to survey my position more dispassionately in the end i decided that it did not matter whether sahak returned the brooch as he had promised or whether as i suspect he kept it for himself knowing that the black rood was among ghazis plunder i wanted to stay close by no matter what as the amirs captive i remained close without arousing even the least shade of suspicion the caliph of baghdads decree of execution was another matter but one which was beyond my influence entirely as i could do nothing to improve my position for the moment i was content to leave it to the swift sure hand two days passed but no one came for me neither did sahak appear at my door i wrote my letter taking time to ponder each and every word before putting it down so i would not have to blot it out if in gods eternal plan i was meant to fall to the headsmans sword i wanted my last message to be perfect the rest of the time i paced the small confines of my cell sometimes praying that padraig would miraculously appear and come striding down the long prison corridor bearing a bag full of silver dinars to buy my release i hope you have not been worrying i could hear him say i was delayed a little still all in gods good time i will have you out of there before you know it needless to say padraig did not arrive on the morning of the third day since my last audience with caliph almutarshid i awoke to rumbling in the guardroom above the prison cellsthe pounding of feet and the clatter of weapons at first i thought an attack must be taking place a raid on the city in reprisal for the destruction of bohemonds army perhaps but then all went very quiet and i along with the rest of the prisoners sat waiting throughout the day for some word or sign of what was taking place beyond the prison walls towards evening the guards returned to the guardhouse and our jailer brought our days ration of food and water he did not understand us nor we him so it was not until sahak came the next morning that i learned of the arrival of an envoy from the caliph of cairo at the time i did not consider this to be an event of much significance but that is the way of things in the east alliances shift like sand on the wind loyalties ebb and flow with the tide the restless wind sifts through the ancient realms and old orders are swept away in the twinkling of an eye an emissary arrived from egypt and the future of the holy land changed my own predicament altered too although at the time i did not perceive much less understand the nature of the change it was no less remarkable in its own way indeed it would be many weeks before i would fully appreciate just how exceptional my circumstances had becomeand how slender the thread by which my life now swung thirtyeight i expected them to come for me in the morning and they did i did not expect them to send sahak yet it was his face i saw when at the sound of the bolt being drawn and the iron bar raised i stood and the door opened fall on your knees and praise god my friend he proclaimed and i could see it gave him great pleasure to do so he had never called me his friend before and i wondered what lay behind his cheerful greeting it is a very miracle you have been reprieved before i could ask how this had come about he said hurry you are to come at once they want to see you why i asked already moving through the open door two guards were with him but neither appeared interested in the proceedings much has happened in the last two days there is to be a great celebration we started down the corridor and i was halfway up the steps to the guardroom when i rememberedmy letter leave it sahak told me there is no time they are waiting let them wait yuallah sahak sighed i ran back to the cell and snatched up the folded parchment stuffing it in my siarc as i rejoined the scribe waiting at the foot of the steps now tell me sahak who is waiting for me is it my friends has padraig come to pay the ransom alas no sahak admitted he had not thought of that it is that the caliph of cairo has sent his personal emissary to damascus he explained meaningfully the man has arrived he is here in the palace at this very moment this emissaryhe is the one who wants to see me in a manner of speaking you are going to cairo my friend is that not wonderful news everything has been arranged praise god any jubilation i might have felt at a stay of execution was swallowed by a new sense of hopelessness if i go to cairo i suggested my friends will never find me if they look for you in damascus they will find you in a traitors grave he countered is that what you want in truth rescue was not uppermost in my mind i was more concerned about becoming separated from the holy rood even so there was not much i could do about that my execution would have effectively separated me from the prize as surely as a sojourn in cairo and far more conclusively rather than berating sahak i decided to be grateful we followed the guards up the stone steps and through the empty guardroom out the open door and across the inner palace yard perhaps it was sahaks excitement making me imagine things but i did sense a ferment in the airas that which marks a change in season yet the sun rising above the bulging white domes of the palace was the same the air hot and dry as ever i thought of this myself the scribe declared proudly it troubled me that you should die for helping my people and i prayed that god would send a way to save you and then the emissary arrived he smiled as if the rest was perfectly obvious i thanked him for his skilful intervention on my behalf and said but i still do not understand why the caliph of cairos emissary should be interested in helping me strictly speaking he does not know he is helping you he thinks he is merely receiving a gift for his master but god works in mysterious ways no yes and so do you sahak by the time we reached the pavillion of roses where atabeg buri was entertaining his two important guests at an earlymorning meal following their prayers i had extracted from sahak the gist of what had happened and knew why i had been summoned the rest took longer to obtain yet by dint of perseverance i gradually unravelled the tangled tale of the stormy relations between the two most powerful caliphates in all the east i should pause here and relate the details of my audience with the atabeg and his illustrious visitors it was however of little account at all they merely wanted to see that i was still alive and hale enough to make the journey to cairo along with the rest of the booty to be delivered as gifts to the caliph you see gait arabs of all stripes are forever giving gifts to one another they do it all the time for any number of reasons the wealthy do it to belittle their rivals strengthen ties between noble houses or win the fealty of those beneath them the poor do it to curry favour with those above to secure preferment in business to demonstrate honour and obedience as part of the spoils of war which ghazi had given to win patronage from buri i was brought forwards to bow and scrape before the enthroned muslim lords delivered into the hands of a servant of the envoy and then led away again i never saw sahak almutarshid buri ghazi or any of my fellow prisoners again nor did i ever learn the name of my new master the envoy i became once more a commodity of exchange a vessel of value to be bartered for favour in this case the favour of the caliph of cairo as i say over the next days as my depth of understanding grew so too did the realization of the awful significance of the events bohemond had set in motion when he decided to attack the armenians i watched my new masters closely and observed them in their dealings and so gained invaluable insight into the complicated affairs of the arab raceinsight which would serve me well in the days to come i kept my eyes and ears open and pieced together any scraps of information that came my way meditating long over them this is what i learned ghazis defeat of bohemonds army greatly relieved and encouraged the muhammedans in a single battle the amir had reduced the christian might in the region and restored muslim hopes that the hated franj might yet be pushed out antioch was now vulnerable to siege and capture the templars could not protect the city by themselves alone without a swift and abundant supply of fresh troops the end was a foregone conclusion for the first time in many many years the turks could entertain notions of recapturing that great city once antioch was under seljuq rule jerusalem could not fail to follow shrewd amir that he was ghazi was not slow to recognize the rich potential of his victory that day when he halted the executions on the battlefield he was already calculating the cost of his next venture the siege of antioch aware that he must strike quickly and decisively ghazi rushed to damascus where he knew the caliph of baghdad had lately arrived on the way he gathered the support for his scheme from those who would help supply the army he hoped to raise a siege is a lengthy and expensive business and ghazi required the aid of more powerful men to mount and supply a force large enough to capture that great city he also needed the consent of his bettersnot only their approval of his military plan but their sanction of his larger aims as well again the wily amir showed his acuity for knowing he did not possess the necessary authority he sought a bargain that would allow him to rule the city once it had been captured to this end he lavished gifts upon his liege lords and vassals alike demonstrating that he had the discernment and largesse of spirit to rule wisely and well as i was learning gift giving among the arabs is a meticulous arrangement of balances as perilous as it is precise for each and every gift carries with it an obligation which binds the recipient to the giver in many and various ways ghazi gave gifts to his overlords so they would grant him the authority to proceed with his plans of conquest caliph almutarshid commanding the highest power was given the greatest gifts the fortuitous appearance of the egyptian envoy added another element to the intricate symmetry of powers and obligations which eastern potentates glory in manipulating as it happened the celebration sahak mentioned was to mark the proposal of a peace treaty between baghdad and cairo it was not until much later that i learned how the two powerful caliphates had been at each others throats for many yearsowing to differences over religious observance mostly the fall of jerusalem had awakened them to the danger of a house divided the caliph of cairo a more farthinking ruler than most had i would eventually discover offered his extensive fleet for the use of a combined arab army united against the common enemy together cairo and baghdad might drive out the invading foreigners this offer had been spurned by the arrogant and pridebound baghdad caliphate which considered itself superior to cairo in every way still as the years passed and the crusaders established themselves as a continual threat and everpresent thorn in the side of the arabs baghdad began to soften to the idea of uniting against the crusaders with the fall of antioch imminent and the prospect of recapturing jerusalem a genuine possibility for the first time in many years the young caliph almutarshid decided it was time to make peace with cairo towards that end the egyptian emissary who was merely making a routine visit to damascus had been summoned and lavished with gifts by way of a peace offering the arabs have long enjoyed a fantastically elaborate game played between two people on a wooden board with dozens of small carved pieces i once observed this game and though i failed to grasp any but the most rudimentary principles it did seem to capture the essence of the intricate convolutions of the eastern mind for although the board is marked with fixed squares of alternating colour red and white each piece moves entirely at willbut only within certain tightly circumscribed limitations peculiar to its rank and for each move there is a countermove each power balanced by an equal and opposite power a game of infinite possibility it is nevertheless played out according to rules as immutable as the mountains and invariable as a sunrise i had become like one of the lesser pieces in this strange game and when the emissary departed damascus two days later i went with him and all the rest of the plunder amassed by ghazi as well to be given to the egyptian caliph as tokens of reconciliation between the powerful rulers of baghdad and cairo so following a fiveday march overland from damascus to the port of sidon on the coast i was put aboard one of the sturdy ships of the egyptian caliphs substantial fleet and we sailed for cairo arriving five days later at damietta on the wide spreading manyfingered delta of the river nile we left the ship at the harbour of damietta a foul stinkhole of a town and proceeded by sailing barge up the wide muddy river to cairo i stood at the low rail and watched the graceful river boats with their single finshaped sails and long steering oars gliding slowly on the brown water we passed tiny settlements built on the banks of the river with long fields of green cultivated grain stretching in wide generous bands behind one after another we passed them so many that they seemed after awhile to merge into a single endless strip of villages all the way to cairo i stood on the deck of the barge and watched life along the river unfold like a vast seamless tapestry unrolled before me to reveal the ageold images of the river realm three boys riding a donkey piled high with palm branches a girl with a willow switch in her hand herding grey geese along the path two women washing clothes at the riverside men casting fishing nets from small bobbing boats a youth carrying a row of dried fish on a pole over his shoulder a laughing bevy of girls with water jars on their heads their mantles knotted around their slender hips a farmer gathering rushes with a curved scythe and another leading an oxdrawn cart mounded with yellow melons naked brown children wading in the cool shallows from the moment we entered the river channel all that had gone before seemed to fade away into the warm heavy air of the valley lowland the looming tribulations of the last days dwindled away to piddling insignificance in the face of an immense and allpervading tranquillity no mere human event could disturb the prodigious peace of that land the great tempests of war and ruin that wreak such havoc among men are but fleeting squalls that arise and disappear swallowed in a serenity as old as the earth i stood on the deck of the barge and felt myself being drawn down and down into the limitless depths of the most profound cakn i had ever knownas if the timeless sky with its bright spray of stars wheeling through its eternal round proclaimed this too shall pass from the beginning i was treated well by those charged with my captivity perhaps they were not told the circumstances of my imprisonment then again as my little jailer wazim kadi told me when i was brought to the caliphs palace the seljuqs are barbarians everyone knows this they are coarse ruffians from out of rhum where they live like wandering beasts of all the many contending races in the turbulent east the saracens consider themselves the most civil and refined with a duty to impart their singular virtues and qualities to those less enlightened than themselves it may be that when they learned i had been a captive of the seljuqs the courtly and cultured saracens took it upon themselves to demonstrate their courtesy nevertheless it was with no little trepidation that i disembarked on the wooden quay which serves the impossible sprawl that is alqahirah as the arabs call it the victorious for it overwhelms all wouldbe conquerors and vanquishes all with its inexhaustible wealth of seductions i looked out from the quay at the dizzying tumult masses of bodies which seemed to ebb and flow like a mottled flood shimmering with sweat in the midday swelter and i quailed before the sight my reprieve as sahak called it merely exchanged one captivity for another i did not know what manner of reception awaited me with the saracens i did not know whether i should be set free or executed before the day was finished the black rood still bound in the rug in which i had wrapped it went with me in this only was i content the holy relic was my strength and my consolation as we made our way up from the river with a train of bearers and handlers hired from the quayside to carry the caliphs treasure passing through one squalid settlement after another we made our slow way towards the massive iron gates that guard the inner city the poor and wretched of the east have heard that the streets of cairo are paved with bricks of gold and the city cannot hold them all so they build their hovels between the banks of the nile and the high city walls and every spring the floods come and wash these pitiful dwellings away many are drowned and their corpses are eaten by crocodilesravenous dragonlike river monsters that bedevil the lower marshes of the river another variety of fierce and loathsome creature infests the stinking waste heaps outside the walls and throng the gates of cairo preying on the unwary beggars at first i was moved with christian pity and charity at the appalling sight of them god have mercy there were so many blind and dumb halt and lame leprous maimed deaf starving naked and sick my soul quailed before their misery but the hostile and belligerent bearing of these unfortunates quickly drove out all compassion like jackals they prowl the crowds looking for victims hobbling pathetically or dragging their wizened and mangled bodies along the streets bleating out their pitiful and practised wails of woe although i was a prisoner and had nothing at all to give that did not stop them from descending upon me grabbing and snatching at my clothes with their withered hands mewling and bawling their pitiful cries god forgive me i soon learned to ignore them and like the guards moved quickly through the shabby ranks pushing aside any who were stubborn enough to stand in the way turning a deaf ear to their shrieks and hurrying on anxiety over my impending fate did not survive beyond a few hundred paces inside the gates for the city was not only larger noisier and more crowded than any i had ever seen it was also more fabulous in every way instantly my sundazed senses were overwhelmed and submerged beneath the dizzying inundation of sight and soundand smell for the slops and refuse of the streetdwellers are allowed to stew in the sun and infuse the air with noxious and pestilential odours while the smells steal the breath away the sounds buffet and batter the beggars with their insistent cries the street merchants with their shrill demands dogs barking children screeching the press of the populace talking shouting calling to one anothera thousand voices clamouring at once the resulting welter of confusion is dizzying as it is deafening and the sights gait in the space of a few dozen paces beyond cairos gates you will see more extraordinary things than most people see in their entire lives wherever the eye happened to light some new and startling view presented itself i saw men and women of wealth swathed head to foot in the most startling robes the colour of which changed with every movement through all the shifting radiant hues of the rainbow i saw copperdomed mosqs covered with gleaming persian tiles so that they looked as if they had been spun of peacockcoloured glass and the people gait were the most unusual to walk under gods wide heaven the colours of their skin ranged from black as dark as midnight shadow through browns of every hue from the deep rich tones of walnuts baked earth and old leather to the fair pallor of fine parchment their shapes and sizes were no less various i saw men as tall and gaunt and black as ebony pillars and others small as halfgrown children the fairest of all were the egyptians themselves fine featured with high noble brows straight white teeth and rich black hair that glistens in the sun they stand erect and move with unhurried grace gazing upon the world with quiet amusement in their dark almondshaped eyes they say they are descended from gods of old and you only have to look at them to believe it a more handsome race you cannot imagine to move about the city is to confront wonders on every side there is more colour more noise more everything to be found on the streets of cairo than anywhere else under the sun hanging from upper windows i saw gilded cages with birds as big as ravens but more brightlycoloured than kings longtailed and hookbeaked with feathers scarlet and green jade blue white and yellow i have no idea what they were or whence they came but they screeched like the bhean sidhe to burst the ear there were dogs unlike any i have seen before or since lean and slender narrow beasts with long thin faces hollow haunches and muscled shoulders almost as big as wolf hounds but sleek and finefooted for running in the sand also though it was a while before i noticed them cats once i began to see them however i was astonished at the numbers there were very multitudes of the creatures and they were everywhere not a shadow in the city but you did not see the glint of a yellow eye looking back not a tree not a market stall not a doorway nor window nor ledge nor wall nor rooftop where a cat did not sit or walk or stretch itself the crooked streets swarmed with every variety of merchant and seller knownsome working from stalls others carrying their wares stacked on their heads or dangling from their armsand every last one shouting to make himself heard above the din here a candlemaker walked with hundreds of candles attached by their wicks to a long pole there a butcher shouted for custom with rings of sausage looped round his outstretched arms next to him a carpenter balanced four chairs on his back and over here an ironmonger jangled examples of the various chains he could makeand more goldsmiths gem dealers slave merchants and every kind of food vendor ever known any space on the street large or small became a veritable marketplace for vendors to tout for business i saw carts heaped high with hairy coconuts others with mounds of sweet black dates and still others with persimmons or pears lemons almonds or green bitter quinces people thronged these impromptu markets or bazaars as they are called eagerly bargaining with the merchants so that the din was a stupendous uproar through the tumult scampered lithe brown children darting around the legs of their elders contributing to the havoc with shrill squeals and shouts barefoot ragged youths darted quickly here and there and more than once as i witnessed with my own eyes relieved unwary passersby of the burden of any unattended purses or belongings our procession snaked through the throngs passing one exotic quarter after anotherincluding one filled with tiny housesthe only quiet corner of the entire city i think and i soon learned why the stench arising from this place gave me to know that at very least a great calamity had befallen those who lived there the powerful odour of death hung like an unseen cloud above the silent streets yet save for a few blackrobed men ambling idly around the deserted streets there was no one about ah the city of the dead wazim told me when i asked him many egyptians still hold to the old ways believing they must feed and house their ancestors in the afterlife the caliphs men paid no heed at all to the commotion around them but passed through it with heads high looking neither right nor left as if the riotous tumult was so far beneath them as to be invisible because of the crush of people and the narrowness of the streets it took the better part of the morning to reach our destination a palace of stone that looked as if it might have been hewn in a single piece from the heart of a mountain in the dazzling heat of a midday sun the pale ochrecoloured stone blazed like faded gold flags of red and blue waved fitfully on tall standards as we passed up the long ramp towards the gates which were made of pierced and gilded iron four tall black men with spears and the skins of lions on their shoulders guarded the entrance at the envoys approach the gatemen opened the gleaming doors without a word the baggage train entered the palace precinct and i passed into my opulent prison thirtynine still dazed from the heady journey through the streets of cairo our baggage caravan passed through a mazework of doorways corridors walls and pathways and arrived at an inner courtyard there to wait in the sun while the envoy disappeared into one of the many rooms fronting the yarda pleasant expanse of green grass and small trees of many varieties all of them meticulously clipped and arranged to show their best features peacocks preened in the low branches and paraded in the sunlight and white doves fluttered around a pool of clear running water flowering shrubs many in gigantic earthenware pots filled the air with a delightful scent and attracted the lazy hum of bees this paradise was bounded by royal residences on three sides a high vinecovered wall enclosed the fourth side each of the royal apartments and chambers featured a balconya roofed but otherwise open platform affixed to the outer upper floor and surrounded by a wooden railing these balconies are common in the arid east for they allow one to escape the heat of the day and enjoy any passing breezes in the city i had seen many such balconies some with elaborate screens of wood those overlooking the inner courtyard were open however so that the residents might enjoy the beauty and calm of the garden below as we stood waiting in the sun i saw a large very fat man in a golden robe and turban appear at the railing of a nearby balcony he paused a moment to take in the sight of us and then ambled away again a few moments later i was conducted with the rest of the baggage into a small woodpanelled hall across the courtyard where this same man was waiting to receive the gifts in the caliphs name he balanced his more than ample girth on a stool at a small table with a square of the peculiar thin egyptian parchment before him and the bearers brought the items onebyone to be entered into his account i watched as both the goldbound box containing the embalmed head of prince bohemond and the black rood were duly recorded and borne away with the rest of the treasurewhere i could not say then it was my turn he looked up from his list passed his eyes over me and smiled ah he said and rose to his feet speaking first in greek and then in latin he asked which of the two languages i preferred latin if you please my lord of course he replied my name is amir abu rafidi he told me and explained that he was the caliphs official katib a position of authority in which as overseer of the inner palace servants and all the other scribes counsellors and courtiers it had fallen to him to receive the gifts which the caliph of baghdad had sent as i was among these gifts the amir was obliged to take account of me and he hoped i did not mind this small formality i am told that you are a nobleman whose chances of ransom have declined to the point of hopelessness he said on the contrary i replied i am ever hopeful my friends will come for me i suspect however that moving almost continually from one destination to the next since my capture has made the task more difficult i see he replied i am also told that you are a spy who has been condemned to death by the khalifa of baghdad is this true not entirely i replied while it is true that the khalifa ordered me to be executed it is not true that i am a spy he smiled at my reply his fleshy jowls wobbling a cheerful man and easily amused i could see he bore me no malice it would be a rare man who readily owned such perfidy i agreed but insisted that it was true nevertheless the amir returned to the table and looked at the blank expanse of parchment before him i could see that he was trying to decide what to write gently lowering himself onto the little stool he folded his arms and rested his chin in his palm tapping his fingers against his cheek he looked up into the air and then down at the table again then he rose and walked around the room hands folded behind him he looked at me and said you are a nobleman i am indeed that makes it all more difficult you see i am sorry no no think nothing of it he quickly reassured me we must all take the rough with the smooth he returned to his place and took up the quill he dipped it in the ink and then hesitated his hand hovering above the parchment he glanced at me thoughtfully ah he said as if discovering the solution to a longvexing problem dipping the pen once more he began to write his hand describing an elaborate flourish as he finished laying aside the pen he picked up the parchment the odd stuff was so thin the light from the open doorway shone through it and i could see the strange characters he had written on the other side holding it before his face he squinted his eyes and grunted with satisfaction then rising and moving to the door he called out loudly and returned to his stool a few moments later the call was answered by the appearance of a little brown man in a long flowing white garment fine featured with skin like a polished nut he wore a small white cap atop his closeshaved head taking a step into the room he bowed and stepped lively to the table where he stood looking at me with bright interest khalifa alhafiz is away from cairo for the foreseeable future abu rafidi told me he dipped the pen and added a few amendatory strokes to what had been written only he can decide your fate he blew on the wet ink to dry it so until the khalifa returns you will be given a room in the palace he lay aside the pen once more and lifting a hand to the whiterobed servant he said this is wazim kadi he will be yourah he paused searching for the right word your jailer let us say he will attend to your various needs while you reside in the palace i am to remain a prisoner i asked you are to be our he hesitated our guest let us say at least until the khalifa returns forgive me for asking my lord amir i said but when is the khalifas return expected only allah knows the katib replied and allah keeps close counsel he smiled pleasantly at least he does not confide in rafidi come now wazim will take you to your room and make you comfortable thus began my friendship with wazim the worthy saracen jailer who has rendered me invaluable service time and time again in a thousand errands large and small it was wazim kadi who provided me with an endless supply of quills and ink with which to write and who first introduced to me the queer parchmentlike stuff called papyrus the egyptians make it from the tall pufftopped reeds that grow everywhere along the rivers edge tough yet light and with the ability to be rolled up tight this papyrus is in many ways superior to hide parchmentsave in one important way a slip of the pen cannot be rubbed out unlike parchment where the odd blot or misplaced letter can be carefully scraped away to reveal a fresh layer beneath any mistakes made on papyrus are there forever despite the differences of race and faith i could not have asked for a better servant unfailingly kind and thoughtful wazim kadi has watched over me like a very angelmuch like padraig in his own way and i will miss him and now dearest caitriona heart of my heart i must conclude my long and i fear far too indulgent missive what started as a simple letter of farewell has grown to a book as i look over the work i have done it pleases me for the most part if not for the assurances of the caliph that it will one day find its way to you i would have despaired long ago but the saracens are trustworthy once honour is invoked they will dare death and beyond to make good a promise the end whatever that shall be is near a short while ago i began hearing cries and shouts of alarm in the corridors and courtyards of the palace these have intensified and just now i caught a faint whiff of smoke through my open window wazim who promised to bring word about what is happening has not returned and i cannot think that a good sign if this tale is to be completed i fear it must be by another hand i am content i will close with a prayer for you and for all those who come after that in virtue you will find wisdom and in wisdom peace in peace contentment in contentment joy in joy love in love jesu and in jesu god and life eternal amen farewell my cait my soul until we meet in paradise forty unable to force open the door i stood at the window and looked out at the dull red bloom spreading across the night sky there were fires in the city and i could hear like the sighing moan of a fretful wind the eerie ululation of thousands of voices shouting screaming crying the smell of smoke was stronger now and i guessed that once begun the flames would quickly race through the narrow tightcrowded quarters leaping street to street until the whole city was alight i was beginning to think what i might do if the flames should come to the palace when i heard the scrape of a key in the lock i turned as the door opened and wazim kadi appeared his face smudged with dirt and soot his long tunic was filthy and soaked through with sweat he was bleeding from a cut on the side of his head and panting for breath wazim i started towards him what has hap glancing over his shoulder he motioned me to silence and then beckoned me to him with a frantic gesture we must hurry daounk he said his voice a raw urgent whisper taking up the bundle of papyri i had prepared using one of my siarcs to wrap it i slipped the loop of a strap over my shoulder and moved to join him at the door lead the way i left the room without looking back he led me quickly along the corridor and then down a flight of steps to another corridor below along this and out into the small inner courtyard overlooked by my window he started away again into the darkness but i took hold of his arm and said wazim wait tell me what is happening where are we going it is very bad he said shaking his head there is no time we must hurry tell me he turned features dark eyes glinting in the lurid glow seeping into the sky the people are rioting he said his voice trembled many have been killed they have set fire to the great bazaar and the khalifa has fled to the citadel we must hurry if we are to escape the soldiers wazimwhere are they some are protecting the khalifa he said most have been sent to quell the rioting what about the palace are there any soldiers here a few not many he pulled on my hands come this way we must hurry to the river your friendsthey are waiting for you my friendsyou mean padraig after so long a time i could scarce credit the words could it be true at last padraig is here in cairo yes himand the others yordanus hippolytus is with him and some others they have a ship come they are waiting he made to dart away again but i held him firmly there is something i must do first no please daounk there is no time the soldiers might return at any moment we must be gone from the palace before they discover i have set you free i told your friends i would bring you they are waiting at the quay we must hurry i cannot leave yet i insisted i need your help wazim now listen carefully i gripped him by both shoulders and looked into his face on the day i was brought here some treasures came with me gifts for the khalifa gifts he said growing fearful do not think about such things we must go now you know what im talking about i replied trying to maintain a calm and reasonable tone the gifts sent by the khalifa of baghdad what happened to them they might have been taken to the treasure house he allowed but it take me there i commanded take me to the treasure house it is impossible we cannot go there it is locked very tight and the caliph only holds the keys the treasure house cannot be opened if you will not help me i will have to find it myself i made as if i would go off alone yordanus paid me to deliver you safely to the ship how am i to do that if you will not come with me he snatched at my sleeve please daounk it is very dangerous to remain here any longer the urgent pleading in his tone warned me why they are saying the fidain are in the city he confessed they may be in the palace even now if they find us they will kill us we must leave while we can soon first the treasure house he rolled his eyes and drew a deep breath but saw it was no good disagreeing any longer muttering dark oaths he led me across the small courtyard and into another of the facing buildings along a corridor and out again into the large garden courtyard i saw when first i arrived at the palace quickly quietly we proceeded along an unseen pathway in the darkness skirting one building and another and coming by furtive means to a very large manyfloored edifice set apart from the main wing of the palace and surrounded by a flowering garden we stopped at the edge of the garden and hid beneath a lowgrowing tree the garden was planted with nightblooming flowers which filled the air with a sweet and heady fragrance so strong it got up in my nostrils i stifled three sneezes and decided it was time to move along there was no one about that i could see and there were no signs of life in any of the buildings surrounding the yard this is the treasure house i wondered although there were no windows on the ground floor the upper floors contained wide and generous balconies most of which were screened but a few of which were completely open allowing access to anyone who could make the climb this is the hareem wazim replied it is the most protected place in the entire palace with soldiers keeping watch day and night the reason he explained was that the hareem as it was called was where the female members of the caliphs familywives concubines and daughtershad their residence i do not see any soldiers i pointed out they have taken the royal family and fled to the citadel where is the treasure house it is under the hareem wazim said below the ground you know as wazim spoke these words i recalled my midnight meeting with the caliph and his unexpected entrance by way of the hidden tunnel with admirable efficiency the treasure house had been constructed beneath the hareem so the same soldiers might guard all the caliphs various treasures at the same time there were no lights showing in any of the windows and the huge building was silent this way i said starting towards the entrance although the guards were gone the door was barred and the bars were secured with large iron boxlike locks which required the use of keys to open you see whispered wazim creeping up behind me they are locked you cannot get in we will leave now there must be another way in there is only this way wazim maintained it is the hareem there is no other way because it is the hareem i contended there mwsfbe another way although i knew little of such things it seemed to me unlikely that the caliph would wish his visits to his various wives to be known by one and all throughout the palace i reckoned that as with the private audience chamber behind the throne room there must be another less conspicuous entrance to accommodate his visits i looked around the square at the surrounding buildings there were two long ranks of storerooms one to the left and one behind the hareem a wing of the palace enclosed the third side and on the fourth side a low building with four funneltopped domes along the roof what is that i asked the kitchen and ovens for the hareem i started towards the building you will find nothing there wazim said scuttling after me at first look it appeared he was right the long low room was empty the large square hearth bare the ovens cold there were a few loaves of bread lying on a table and some pears in a basket but i could see nothing else in the dark interior i went in and felt along the raised rim of the hearth what are you doing said wazim they will find us let us go from here my friend in a moment i found what i was looking for a pile of straw used for kindling to start the fires i took up a handful and bunched it in my fist then leaned over and reached out into the centre of the hearth and swept away the top layer of ash to reveal a few glowing coals beneath holding the bunch next to the coals i blew gently on the straw and was soon rewarded with a pale yellow sprout of flame soon the rest of the bunch was alight and holding it up i quickly searched the room for a candle finding three i lit one stuck one in my belt and gave the third to wazim and told him to stand by the door and keep watch warn me if anyone comes into the garden i said by candlelight i made a thorough search of the kitchen pausing only to tear one of the loaves in half and cram bits of it into my mouth it was stale but edible and i resumed my search as i chewed i searched around and between the ovens and found a small doorway leading outside through which fuel for the hearth and ovens could be brought in i went outside and found myself in a closedin area stacked with wood bundles of twigs and straw cupping my hand around the flame i moved along behind the row of ovens and came upon a wooden cover on the ground between two of them lifting the cover i held my candle into the void and saw a short flight of steps leading down i removed the cover quietly and set it aside then fetched wazim he took one look at what i had found and said it is the ash traps for cleaning the ovens there is nothing here ignoring him i moved down the steps and found that he was right a brick rampart ran along the back of a dressed stone wall forming a large box to catch the ash falling through the oven grates above a walkway in front of the rampart allowed the cleaners to remove the ash at one end of the walkway was a small opening for air to feed the fires from beneath and at the other end of the walkway a door i called wazim to follow me and proceeded to the door lifting the latch i opened the door and stepped through into the cool damp darkness of a great cavernous room i heard the liquid drip of water splash in the distance it is the cistern for the hareem wazim announced upon joining me his voice echoed from unseen walls come there is nothing here but there is i told him look raising my candle i held it close to the wall to reveal a torch in an iron sconce beside the door i took it up lit it from the candle and the resulting flame revealed a short walkway forming a ledge alongside the basin of the cistern at the end of this walkway there was another door this way the door opened onto a small room which served to connect two corridors one to the left and one to the right as we were now beneath the hareem i imagined one corridor or the other must lead to the treasure house while thinking which to try first a sharp tapping sound came from some distance away down the corridor on the righthand side three taps followed by a short silence and then three more wazim heard them too and pulled on my sleeve someone is down here he whispered desperately they will find us if we stay any longer stay close i said and started down the corridor it was a low vaulted passage of brick and stone i held the torch before me and crept quietly along listening to the rhythmic tapping which grew louder the further we advanced a line of small openings ran along the top portion of the tunnel no larger than a mans hand i could feel cool air moving through these openings as i crept past the passage ended a few score paces along joining another larger tunnel which angled sharply down the tapping sound was louder here and i could hear something elseit sounded like voices but too muffled and indistinct to make out what they were saying drawn on by these sounds i descended the passageway wazim trembling behind me tugging insistently at my sleeve and urging me away with every step we soon arrived at another juncture i could see it for the faint flickering of torchlight on the brickwork several score paces directly ahead of me the rhythmic tapping had become a steady thudding pound punctuated by grunts and mutterings stay here i said handing the torch to wazim i slipped the strap on the bundle of papyri from my shoulder and handed that to him as well i will see what is ahead he made to object but i waved him to silence and pointed to the spot on the ground where he was to plant himself and then crept forwards alone as i neared the end i could see that a heavy iron grate sealed the opening i lay down and squirmed forwards the last few paces on my stomach and looking between the thick bars of the grate peered around the corner and into the adjoining corridor beyond by the smudgy light of half a dozen torches scattered around them on the ground two men with short axes were hacking at a timber door the door however was bound with thick iron bands and was resisting their best efforts the men were arabs dressed in black with dark brown turbans and were unlike any i had ever seen among the caliphs soldiers or bodyguard their determined expressions and relentless hammering gave me to know that i had indeed found the treasure house i edged back from the grate and was about to withdraw until i could devise a plan for getting rid of my unwanted fellow thieves when someone called out the two stopped working and for a moment the passage became silent curious i crawled back to the grating the two had downed their axes and were talking to someone who had joined them the third man remained out of sight beyond the edge of the corridor and although i could not see who it might be something about the sound of the voice held me from the way the thieves were complaining and gesturing to the door with their inadequate axes i guessed they were bemoaning their lack of success to an impatient superiorwho apparently had little sympathy for their troubles for as i lay watching one of the blackturbaned thieves offered his axe to the newcomer indicating that he should try the door himself the proffered tool hung between them and for an instant i thought the other would decline but then a hand reached out and took the axe the newcomer stepped into view and proceeded to try his hand at the unyielding door the blade clattered against the woodonce twice and again whereupon he stopped and handed the axe back to its owner he turned and my breath caught in my throat as his face was revealed in the fluttering torchlight the templar renaud de bracineaux fortyone de bracineaux returned the axe to the arab and the two stood discussing the matter my first thought was to call out to him to let him know that i was herebut the sight of the templar commander instructing arab thieves in their own tongue was too strange and as it seemed to me sinister i hesitated watching silently i was still trying to decide what to do when i felt wazim creep up beside me raising a finger to my lips i cautioned him to silence and then allowed him to peer around the corner the instant he put his face to the grate a strange thing happened he sniffed once and again then froze his eyes going wide with terror he backed away at once and retreated down the passage i went after him pausing to retrieve the torch he had dropped by the time i caught up with him at the junction the pounding had begun again grabbing hold of his elbow as he entered the adjoining corridor i arrested his flight who are they i demanded the arabsyou knew them who are they fidain wazim gasped are you certain he nodded his eyes still wide with fright the smell he said did you not smell it now that he said it i did recall a sweet pungency i thought it was from the torches it is hashish we must get away from here if the fidain find us they will kill us templars and fidain together were these not the fanatical sect that had caused the death of yordanus son and the reason he had to flee damascus any other time i might have doubted such an unnkely alliance as extraordinary as it seemed however i knew wazim was right what were they after in the caliphs treasure house not i thought his gold and silverat least not entirely the presence of renaud de bracineaux put the thought in my head that they too sought the black rood the amount of plunder gleaned from the massacre was not great but de bracineaux would know that the capture of the holy rood was a greater calamity than the destruction of bohemond and his troops the more my thoughts raced along this path the more convinced i became that de bracineauxs quest and my own were one and the same if the templars found the rood first i would lose it forever please daounk let us go all the treasure in the world will do you no good if you are dead i care nothing for the caliphs gold i decided it was time to trust wazim with the truth listen to me my friend there is something you must know i told him about the remnant of the sacred cross even now residing in the caliphs treasure house by all that is holy breathed wazim kadi lapsing into an astonished silence his reaction surprised me i had not expected the saracen to hold such reverence for a christian relic but there was no time to wonder about it now that is why the templars are here they know bohemond lost it and they are here to get it back then they will surely succeed concluded wazim gloomily we cannot subdue the templars or the fidain and we cannot fight them together i do not intend to fight them for it i told him neither will i stand aside and watch them grab it away again so saying i slung the bundle of papyri over my shoulder and started off along the passage again this time in the opposite direction and with a heavy heart i counted de bracineaux a friend in any other circumstances i would have hailed him and embraced him as a brother but cruel fate aided by bohemonds folly had placed us in sharp contention for the prize if i got hold of the black rood first i would not be giving it back to the templars or anyone else i had made a sacred vow and it was not in me to betray it please can we leave now said wazim padding dutifully after me not until we find another way into the treasure house but there is no other way it is a treasure house there is only one way in that is what you said about the hareem we hurried back to the first junction where the passage divided to the right and left the lefthand side led back to the cistern so i took the passage to the right this way almost immediately we came to an opening with steps leading up into the hareem i supposed there was an unlit torch in a sconce beside the steps and taking this i handed it to wazim and continued on after a few hundred paces the passage narrowed and began to bend downward there were two more openings off the main passage one to the right and one to the left the one on the left was half the height of a man and the one on the right was not much larger as we passed the opening on the right a faint rush of air fluttered the torch flame the air was warm and i could smell the scent of flowers i put the torch into the opening but could see little save a downward angled shaft and another vertical shaft directly above leaning into the shaft i looked up into the connecting vent and saw stars in the square opening above there seemed no point in lingering so we moved quickly on the downward angle of the slope increased sharply every few paces a step appeared and then two and then three at a time no more junctions or openings appeared however nor did this tunnel of a passageway divide or branch off after a while i lost heart and began to think wazim was right after all i came to a long flight of steps the end of which i could not see in the feeble light of the torch and there we paused why are we stopping asked wazim a little breathlessly listen down the passagewaysome distance ahead by the sound of it heard the ripple and splash of moving wateran aqueduct perhaps supplying water to the palace it sounds like a stream we have left the palace behind it might be the nile perhaps i allowed and started off again the steps led down and down and soon i could smell the water and feel the cool dampness on my skin the last few steps disappeared beneath the surface of the water dropping away so quickly i was almost in the stream before i caught myself a rusted iron ring protruded from the step on which i stood and there was a rope tied to the ring bending down i pulled on the rope but it was secured to something heavy which remained out of sight beyond the small circle of light handing the torch to wazim i took the rope in both hands and pulled harder there was a rippling sound and a boat came gliding into view wazim took one look at the boat and said this is the canal of khalifa alhakim it leads to the river you know this he shrugged i have heard of it the canal was built many years ago a hundred years or more alhakim was despised he built many great thingsthe palace the hareem and the citadel many thingsbut he taxed the people hard to pay for all these buildings and there were many riots in those days they say he built this secret canal so that he could escape if the people ever revolted against him indicating the channel wazim added you hear many such things in the palace until now i never believed all these stories time slipped away every moment we wasted the templars quest advanced unhindered and mine faltered back we raced taking the steps two at a time as they came arriving breathless at the top of the passage a few more steps brought us to where the two smaller openings joined the tunnel and i decided to try the low one on the righthand side first once more i gave wazim the bundle of papyri and bade him wait for me going on hands and knees i entered the opening it was dry and dusty and ended after only a few dozen paces unable to turn around i backed up it is closed up with brick i said upon rejoining wazim we will try the other one stepping across the passage i entered the second opening the roof of the tunnel was higher than the last one though not so high that a man might walk upright and it was narrow after a few steps i was forced to turn sideways a few more steps and i had to slide along with my back to the walldifficult to do as i could not fully stand in this slow way i proceeded along until i came to a tight sharplyangled bend beyond which all was darkness and i could see nothing if not for the fact that i could feel cool air moving on my face i would have turned back instead i called wazim to follow with the light and taking a deep breath squeezed through the opening and waited for him on the other side the moving air made a faint but steady breeze which guttered the lowburning torch it will go out soon wazim observed give it to me i told him and keep the other one ready once past the angled bend the passageway opened out once more we moved on and came to a small threecornered room one side of which opened onto a steep flight of stone steps the steps were set in a spiral which ended in a room identical to the one below and with a narrow tunnel leading on in the opposite direction we paused a moment to light the second torch i retrieved from him my precious bundle and then moved along just ahead this new passage ended in a short downward flight of steps and the shattered remains of a wooden door the door had been barred but the timber was old and rotten someone had kicked their way through the lower half of the door the fractured pieces of which were scattered over the floor inside holding the torch before me i squatted down ducked through the opening crawled over the broken bits of timber and found myself in a small vaulted room containing stacks of slowly mouldering papyrus scrolls tied in braided cords moving quickly on i proceeded through the arched doorway at the end of the room and entered a much larger room this one filled with ceremonial saddles bridles and other such tack for horses and camelsrow upon row of highbacked saddles trimmed in silver and gold some displayed on standards some merely heaped on the floor there were scores of lances too most with cloth pennons and flags attached to their blunted ends and in one corner i saw four chariots resting on their axles their painted wheels stacked and leaning against a pillar we have found the treasure house wazim i said softly now to find the rood i had expected to find a single halllike room filled with the caliphs wealth and richesa great jumble of objects boxes and caskets filled with coin and plate bowls and cups rings and jewelled ornaments and the like it was instead a very house room gave way to room with connecting galleries and corridors halls chambers and storerooms we passed quickly through the first two chambers and came to a long doublevaulted gallery with a central row of pillars and low doorways on either side upon entering this gallery the pounding soundwhich had been absent for some timecommenced anew this time the blows were sharper harder more measured i suspected that either newer fresher troops had been assigned to the duty or better tools had been found perhaps both i did not know how long the ironbound timber could withstand such battering but reckoned that we had little time to make our discovery and escape there were many rooms to explore but only one torch and that would not last long so without an instants hesitation we started the searchbeginning with the nearest rooms the first two chambers contained jars of various kinds as the dust on the floor revealed no recent footprints i did not bother looking further than the doorway the third room contained rugs rolled up or tied in bundles the fourth room was full of caskets of many sizes and at first i thought i might find some of the treasure that had come to cairo with me but again the dust had not been disturbed in a very long time so we quickly moved on meanwhile the crashing on the wooden door grew steadily louder the blows falling harder and more rapidly as if those on the other side were becoming more determined we had searched but four rooms and twice that many remained at the pace we were making the torch would burn out before we finishedif the templars did not break through first there must be an easier way i grumbled darting towards the doorway of the next room and then it came to me the dust on the floorsof course abandoning the search of the chambers at the end of the gallery i made directly for the rooms nearest the entrance holding the torch low i saw that the chamber on the righthand side had not been recently used i cautioned wazim to silence and moved quickly to the other side of the gallery passing the door which was now shuddering under the violence of the attack i could hear the wood splintering as the axes thudded and the grunt of the men as they hewed at the solid timber at the doorway to the last room i paused and held the torch to the floorholding my breath at the same time and i saw it a trail in the dust of the chamber floor caused by the passing of many feet this way i whispered i stepped into the chamber and my heart sank it was not a chamber at all but another gallery and larger than the one we had just searched the torch was already flickering as it burned the last of its fuel and from the sound of the shuddering door the templars would soon be through there was nothing for it but to go on and hope for the best holding the torch low i moved as quickly as i could following the trail in the dust once inside the gallery however the trail quickly dissolved as footprints scattered everywhere across the floor it seemed to me that most of them tended towards the rooms on the lefthand side of the long doublevaulted room so that is where we began the first chamber contained a quantity of small wooden casketsmany carved and inlaid with motherofpearl a swift inspection revealed the boxes contained cups bowls and ornamental bells hold this i said giving the torch to wazim and taking up one of the caskets i dumped out the cup and carried the empty box back out into the gallery where i smashed it against a pillar the wood was old and dry and splintered easily into pieces i instructed wazim to break up the pieces still further and hurried back for another i did this with three more of the boxes then heaped the broken fragments against the base of the pillar and using a wad of cloth from the inside of one of the caskets set the heap on fire with the torch stay here and keep the fire going i instructed wazim taking up the torch i hurried on the second room contained earthenware jars filled with perfumed oil and in the third rolls and bundles of cloth of gold and silver and multicoloured richly patterned damascus cloth i looked in three moreeach with similar items but there was nothing i recognized as having come from amir ghazis hoard as i rushed on to the next rooms a great crash sounded from the main gallery the sound seemed to fill the treasure house resounding and echoing through the underground corridors this mighty clash was followed by a long silence after which the pounding of the axes resumed in earnest i quickly completed the search of the last three roomsone was little more than a narrow alcove and contained nothing but a few pottery jars and high up on the end wall a large square vent covered by a partially open ironwork grate the other two rooms were each filled with items of ceremonial armour stacks of painted wooden shields bundles of tasselled halberds sheaves of curved swords standing upright in wooden barrels helmets ranged around the walls and floor in ranks upon examining the last room i dashed across and started in on the opposite side of the gallery feeling the grip of desperation tightening around me i prayed great king if you care about the honour of your name help me to restore it now in truth i do not know what i meant by this the words came to me and i spoke them out the reply was immediateif from an unexpected source daounk wazim kadi shouted behind me i turned to see the little saracen standing beside the pillar the fire at its base burning brightly in the gloom of the gallery he was pointing across to a chamber on the other side of the entrance look i glanced where he indicated and saw the glow of a torch as it passed from view into the chamber did you see who it was i called already running for the doorway it was a father he replied at least that is what i thought he said it did not make sense to me but there was no time to ask questions i sped to the chamber and looked in it was a large room with several columns forming aisles between several of the columns someone had heaped up mounds of objects there was no sign of the torchbearing man wazim had seen was it a trick of the light had we imagined it then i saw the goldtrimmed box containing bohemonds head and all questions vanished having carried that grotesque trophy all the way from kadiriq to damascus i would have recognized its gleaming tracery and metalbound edges in my sleep i started for the heap just as another tremendous crash resounded from the main gallerythis one accompanied by a slow creaking cracking sound and a second clatter i guessed part of the door had given way it would not be long before the templars and their fidain allies gained entrance i dived into the mound and tossing the torch to the floor began pulling things from the heap and throwing them aside many were objects i recognized and this encouraged me greatly but as the pile diminished my hopes began to fade there came another enormous walloping crash followed by a long groaning crack as another portion of the ironclad door gave way an instant later the lowburning torch gave a last sputtering spurt and sizzled out i raced back to the doorway and called for wazim to bring a piece of wood from the fire they are getting very close now he said handing the burning brand to me so are we i replied the relic is in this room somewhere there came another tremendous crack on the door i could hear the timber splintering as sections were ripped away what would you have me do daounk pray wazim to my surprise the little jailer folded his hands closed his eyes and began chanting then and there leaving him to his prayers i took the burning chunk of wood and kneeling beside the casket containing prince bohemonds head i unfastened the clasp and opened it the flickering light playing over the embalmed princes frozen features made it seem as if he was trying to awaken from his serene and perpetual sleep may god forgive me for what i am about to do i said and touched the burning wood to the princes stiff hair the resulting flame was much brighter and larger than i expected due to the pitch resin in the embalming mixture the waxen flesh burned readily i watched for a moment as the flames licked across the contours of his face singeing off eyelashes and brows and painting his becalmed expression with a liquid glaze of shimmering flame satisfied that the flame would not go out i picked up the box and carried it quickly along the colonnade to the next mound of plunder there by the light of bohemonds flaming head i began pawing through the trovethis time to wazims rapidly muttered prayers which he interrupted long enough to urge me to hurry faster two more booming crashes trembled the walls of the treasure house before i reached the bottom of the heap only to come up empty handed my frustration was eased by the thought that there was only one mound left and the rood must be there the casket containing the burning head was on fire now and too hot to pick up so i shoved it with my foot to the next hoarded heap and waded in scattering valuable objects right and left crack the door in the main gallery splintered and groaned hurry shouted wazim he was standing at the chamber doorway they have made a hole in the door i can see them now over here i called it has to be in this heap somewhere help me find it wazim hastened to my side and together we ploughed into the mound of objects heedless i strewed costly objects everywhere i tossed aside jewelled daggers carelessly threw away a fine bow and quiver of golden arrows and sent silver bowls and chalices clattering across the floor and then i found it the rug in which i had wrapped the holy relic i fell upon it at once and pulled it to me even as my hand closed on the rolled rug however i knew my hope was disappointed the roll was empty the black rood was gone beneath the rug i saw one of the gemencrusted gold bands that had capped the ends of the piece the other gold band lay beside it mangled and flattened by the bearers clumsy feet my poor heart rending with dismay i stooped and retrieved the flattened band there in the dying light of bohemonds burning skull tears welled up in my eyes as my failure overwhelmed me all that time i had spent in captivity nursing the hope however tenuous that i might rescue the sacred relic but the black rood was gone daounk said wazim what is wrong it is gone i replied letting the gold bands slip from my hands we are finished from the main gallery there came a final thunderous crash and the sound of splintered timber careening across the floor a cheer went up from the soldiers on the other side with that the last of the flames gave out the box broke into embers and the skull rolled onto the floor empty eye sockets staring at me lipless mouth grinning in grim mockery the burned bone glowed red for a moment and then that too disappeared in the darkness wazim called me again i made no reply there was nothing to say the soldiers would be on us at any moment and that would be the end of it i heard wazim moving in the darkness and felt a touch on my arm i thought he meant to move me along i am sorry wazim i said it was all for nothing out in the main gallery the last remnant of the door gave way and with shouts of triumph the templars stormed into the treasure house fortytwo i stood in the darkness listening to the whoops and shouts of the templars and fidain resounding through the main gallery and echoing in the chambers and passages as the light from their torches flickered dimly on the wallsa phantom army swarming up from the netherworld to plunder the caliphs treasure and they would have it too there was no one to stop them templars and fidain together i thought on what unholy day had that alliance been forged i listened to the sounds of their hurried footsteps as they raced to the plunder a race i had hoped to win i had faileda truth made more brutal for the fact that i had allowed myself to believe that god was with me leading me each step of the way that my trials had been for a purpose that my suffering had meaning but it was all a lie i knew it now and the knowledge made my heart writhe like a snake in hot ashes i could have wept for the futility of it if not for the knot of hard hot anger coiling in my gut wazim whispered my name again gently pulling me from my miserable reverie look he said in a voice halfstifled with awe the holy father is here i turned my head towards the sound of his voice and saw a faint glimmer of golden light reflecting on the surface of one of the stone pillars behind us it vanished again before i could determine the source nevertheless i moved towards the place and discovered that the pillar stood before the alcove i had examined a few moments ago the light appeared to emanate from within this narrow cryptlike room stepping quickly to the low entrance i saw a man dressed all in white holding a torch in his left hand his robe was that of a cleric a priest of an eastern order so i thoughtand his bearing both lordly and humble that of a venerated patriarch i understood at once why wazim had called him a holy father yet in face and form he was youthful still his beard and hair black the glance of his dark eyes keen he beckoned me to him but astonished as i was i made no move to join him for although he held a torch it was not the torch which shed the light it was the whole of his being raising his hand he beckoned me again more insistently and said come quickly duncan time grows short at the sound of my name i edged forwards a step or two who are you lord that you know me duncan he said in a tone of gentle reproof does not the master know his servants how should i forget one who has served me so well the white priest i whispered wazim kadi sank to his knees beside me bowed his head and shut his eyes tight call me brother andrew he replied lightly as i once asked your father so i now ask you what do you want it seemed a strange questionwith soldiers clattering through the main gallery behind us rushing eagerly to the plunder what difference did it make what i wanted strange too his question instantly brought to mind the cool clean breeze of the northern scottish coast and i saw the dark waves driven white upon the hard rock shingle of caithness bay and standing on the high headland gazing out to sea two figures one tall and gaunt one small cherubic her long hair blowing in the windmurdo my father with little caitriona by his sideand they were searching the wide waveworried sea at that moment i wanted nothing more than to be sailing into that bay and to hold those people in my arms i want to go home i murmured feeling the tears rising to my eyes so did your father replied the white priest but he was proud and would not admit it perhaps he was made of sterner stuff than his unfortunate son why unfortunate asked the mysterious monk you have the holy light to guide your steps along the true path murdo paid dearly to learn what you already know there came a shout at the door of the chamber behind us wazim on his knees beside me clasping his hands and muttering fervent prayers jumped to his feet turned and ran to the alcove entrance i know nothing i said feeling my failure afresh and unless you help us i will not live to see another morning in this land o man of little faith i will tell you what i told your father the first time we met what is that take heart you are closer than you know at that moment wazim called from the doorway daounk he whispered urgently they are coming this way i glanced towards wazim as he spoke and as i did so the light in the alcove began to fade what if i said turning once more towards the white priest he was gone leaving only a gently fading glow where he had been standing but in that shimmering light i saw that he was right what are we going to do wazim rasped in desperation they are almost here peace wazim i whispered come away from there taking his arm i pulled him away from the alcove entrance brother andrew has led us to the treasure he glanced around the nearempty room and then turned frightened eyes on me where he asked there i told him pointing to the vent shaft where an old length of timber was propping open the iron grate he has also shown us our way out as darkness closed around us i reached up and caught the edge of the shaft opening i jumped and wazim took hold of my legs and boosted me up into the opening whereupon i scrambled into the shaft once inside i reached down and pulled wazim up after me then carefully reverently i took hold of the short wooden beam and with wazims help gently eased the heavy iron grate shut it closed with a dull clank as two templars entered the chamber behind us they searched the room sweeping the corners with torchlight and finding nothing swiftly moved on i allowed myself a low sigh of relief and sat back a moment to catch my breath and reflect on how best to make our retreat now we go i whispered to wazim what about the holy cross he asked the search is over i told him heregive me your hand in the darkness i found his hand and guided it to the scarred length of timber cradled in my arms like a blind man his fingers traced the deepgrooved lines and ridges of the ancient wood and tears formed in his eyes and mine as each in our own way we honoured the sacred relic the voices of the templars and fidain echoed in the chamber below and my thoughts turned once again to escape of the few courses open to me i determined that the vent shaft offered the best chance of evading discovery and capture the ascent was steep but not impossibly so i soon found that i could crawl up the incline slowly on hands and knees pushing the rood before me this i did and a short time later wazim and i had reached the secret passage above although it was as dark as the deepest cavern i smelled the nightblooming flowers in the breeze from the vertical shaft and knew without a doubt where we were standing with my back to the shaft the tunnel opened out to the right and left the passage to the right led back to the cistern and the ashtraps below the kitchens the lefthand passage led to the underground canal the canal would take us to the river thereby avoiding not only the palace and any lurking templars or fidain but also the overcrowded streets with their rioting throngs this i decided was the way we would go hefting the rood piece onto my shoulder we started off one blind man following the other wazim walked before me with my bundle of rolled papyrus scrolls slung across his chest and i followed keeping my left hand outstretched my fingertips brushing his back more for comfort than need since the passage led in only one direction without divisions branches or turnings there was no chance of becoming lost thus we made our way to the secret stream stumbling now and then but proceeding with good speed the sacred relic was heavy and unwieldy but after carrying bohemonds head all that time i had learned how to bear a burden without tiring myself unduly and after a time i found i did not greatly mind the darkness although i was blind as a stone i knew the canal lay just ahead and that there was a boat waiting to take us to the nile where at long last i would be reunited with padraig and the others in a little while the downward trend of the passage increased and we came to the first of the series of low stepsfirst one and then two and so on until i could hear the ripple and splash of the stream ahead we checked our pace and continued with greater caution arriving at the waters edge at last passing the rood to wazim i knelt down on the last step and felt along the edge of the wall for the ring to which the boat was tethered after much fumbling i found the ring and then set about untying the rope it was knotted tight and there was no loosening it the braided cord however was old and scuffing it against the brickwork of the passage it soon frayed to the place where using all my strength i was able to pull it apart wrapping the end of the rope around my hand i pulled the boat to the steps and instructed wazim to lay the rood down on the path behind me and get into the small craft i will steady it for you i told him when you are ready i will hand you the rood slowly and with exaggerated care we settled wazim in the boat and i handed him the rood telling him to hold it upright and clenched between his knees keeping one hand on it at all times then it was my turn i was able to get in without capsizing our vessel and allowing the stream to turn us i released my hold pushing away as the bow came around the flow of water was not fast and the boat glided away slowly it was strange floating along in utter darkness but for the gentle stirring of air on our faces we might have been sitting completely still in the water from time to time i dipped my hand in the stream to test that we were indeed moving along with the flow once we bumped against the side of the canalwhich startled both of us and caused wazim to cry out in alarm i was able to push away without incident and from then on kept one hand out so as to fend off another collision unfortunately the damage was already done the boat was old the wood rotten and the impact though mild had loosened part of the hull and caused a seam to open allowing water to seep into the boat the first i knew of it was when i felt my feet getting wet i put down my hand and realized the bottom of the boat was awash stay very still i warned wazim the leak is slight and we may yet reach our destination before the hull fills with water that was not to be however soon water was sloshing over our ankles bailing was futile although i tried for a while cupping my hands and flipping it out by the handful i could not keep pace with the rising water can you swim wazim i asked no master he replied his voice taking on a quaver of concern i assured him that i could swim well enough for both of us and that there was nothing to worry about i was still offering this assurance when the boat struck the canal wall again and the seam opened wider i felt the water rising and said listen carefully wazim i am going to get out of the boat and into the water stay just as you are and do not move i will hold to the side of the boat and all will be well this was far too optimistic however the darkness complicated everythingeven simple movements became manoeuvres fraught with difficulty in the end i succeeded in sliding over the side without overturning our fragile craft the water was not overly cold and i reckoned that by removing my weight from the boat we just might make it to the river before the vessel sank we struck the side two more times in quick succession and the second bump spun the boat around despite being in the water i was able to keep the vessel from overturning and perhaps we would have made it to our destination intact if the current had not picked up markedly at the same time i could not see what caused the stream to move more quickly but thought it must be that the walls of the canal had narrowed and then in the distance i heard the rushing splash of falling water not wishing to alarm wazim i said i think it would be a good idea to join me now i am happy to remain in the boat daounk hereplied his voice trembling in the darkness i think you may have no choice wazim i want you to hand the rood to me first and then ease over the side we can hold to the rail the boat will float a long time yet even with water in it i could feel the stream beginning to swirl around me as the current strengthened the rushing sound grew louder in the dark it would be impossible to judge the severity of the drop or even to know how far ahead it lay i kept this to myself however as i did not wish to frighten wazim the more here i said tapping the rail with my hand let me take the rood and then i will help you over the side muttering in some incomprehensible tongue he passed the holy relic to me and then prepared to ease himself over the side gripping the side of the boat he made to stand and at that moment i felt the bow veer sharply away the boat struck the wall of the canal and poor anxious wazim was thrown off balance he gave out a terrified yelp and released my hand as he fell back into the boat i heard the dry crack of rotten wood there was a shuddering splash and the fragile craft began to break apart grappling with chunks of wreckage i shouted for wazim and made for the sound of his thrashing and coughing all at once the water surged around me i felt the floor come up sharply beneath my feet and floundered for a foothold chunks of stone scraped my knees and shins as i was dragged forwards by the force of the water i shouted for wazim to keep his head up and then felt a rising swell like that of the open sea as i was swept over the falls holding tight to the rood i plunged sideways and struck a jumble of stone blocks on the bottom of the stream bed i was tumbled along beneath the surface of the water pummelled by pieces of wreckage as the ruined boat came sliding over the falls the black rood slipped from my hands as i was rolled over again and again by the force of the water all was darkness and turmoil i could not tell where i was nor which way to the surface i flailed underwater desperate to rise but the stream went on and my lungs felt like they were on fire my chest ached i must soon breathe or burst and then i collided with something harda dense and solid mass moving with me in the water even blind and confused i knew it was the rood i threw my arms around it and let it guide me to the surface i clung to the holy rood gasping gulping down air and thanking the swift sure hand for his timely deliverance i felt something squirming in the water as it slid past i snaked out a hand and snagged the edge of wazims robe and pulled him up he spluttered and coughed and thrashed around wildly peace wazim i shouted i have you now be still you will not drown i had to repeat this several times before he ceased struggling but eventually the fight went out of him and he allowed me to bear him up holding to the rood with one hand and to wazim with the other while at the same time trying to keep my head above wateri could do little more than drift with the current and this i did until the stream began to lose some of its force and turbulence we bobbed along for a time until i struck the side of the canal with my foot releasing wazim for a moment i fumbled in the darkness for a handhold on the rough stonework here wazim i said dragging him to the wall we are saved grab hold and hang on we were saved indeed pushing the holy relic before me i worked my way along the wall feeling for each handhold and talking to wazim all the while soothing him with words of encouragement we edged along this way for untold ages it is strange but in the darkness with nothing to mark either passage or progress time seemed to stop we floated in a timeless eternity with neither beginning nor end only a very wet and endless present as i say i do not know how long we continued this way but there came a place where i reached for a handhold and instead of stone my fingers touched wet moss or slime and slipped my head sank below the surface i kicked my legs to right myself and touched something soft underfootnot once only but twice and then again it took me a moment to realize that it was mud the bottom of the canal was covered with soft mushy silt a short time later i found i could stand and keep my head above water see here wazim i said encouragingly the water is growing more shallow get your feet under you and stand we moved on a little further and the level of the stream continued to drop as the channel grew wider soon we were sloshing through waisthigh water i pushed the floating rood along beside me and a short time after that i noticed a watery grey dimness seeping into the air after so long a time in the inky blackness of utter darkness i did not trust my eyesight but the wan gloaming held and strengthened and after a time i could deny it no longer wazim noticed it too i think it is getting lighter praise gods almighty christ he said crossing himself in the eastern manner you surprise me wazim why did you think you were the only christian in all of egypt he gave me a wry smile the copts may not be numbered among the mightiest but what we lack in strength we make up in stealth you knewall this time you knew i was a christian yet you never said anything you never let on why why did you not tell me give me a sign or something a christian in the khalifas court must be very careful if he cares to keep his head on his shoulders the water level continued to fall as the walls of the canal stretched further apart i noticed that the roof had become bare rock instead of brick and soon we were slogging through water just over our knees i picked up the rood and carried it on my shoulder we walked on and the light grew steadily brighter it came to me that this was because it was growing lighter outside while we toiled below ground night had passed in the wider world and dawn was breaking people were rising to begin their daily tasks and i i was free and on my way home with the prize i had set out to rescue the satisfaction i felt in this achievement was sharply diminished a few steps later when i realized i had lost my sheaf of papyri wazim the bundle i gave youwhere is it he stopped and patted himself about the chest and back i do not know my friend he turned and looked into the solid black recesses of the tunnel behind us i think the strap must have come loose when i fell out of the boat he turned mournful eyes to me i am sorry daounk no matter i replied weakly feeling the loss all the time i had spent in that singular labour gone how absurd to bemoan such a trivial thing i thought the letter was merely a meagre attempt at consolation for my failure to return home and all things considered it was far better to have survived in the flesh still foolish as it was i regretted losing something that had occupied so much of my thought and care these many months i felt as if a part of my life had been carelessly lopped off and discarded see there daounk wazim said drawing me from my thoughts i looked where he was pointing and saw sunlight on a pale grey wall of stone a few hundred paces further ahead a short time later we rounded a bend in the canal and reached our destination a massive iron portcullis covered the canal entrance but this was so old and rusted there were gaps showing in the ironwork and it was but the chore of a moment to force a hole wide enough to squeeze through a few more steps following the stream around the base of a massive shoulder of fallen rock loosed from the overhanging cliffs above and we were standing in the reedfringed shallows peering with dazzled eyes at a golden sunrise shimmering on the nile fortythree our underground journey had taken us to a place on the river below the city walls which rose sheer from the pale ochre cliffs above us the sun was just rising in a glare of golden fire and the air was already warm and heavy the tall reeds and river grass bent in a light breeze and i could hear the buzzing thrum of flies overhead as we stood in a sandy shoal feeling the lifegiving sunlight play over our faces across the river the low mudbrick huts of craftsmen and farmers glistened like pale gold in the earlymorning light a man and a boy led an ox along the bank scaring two snowwhite egrets into flight out on the water a graceful lowhulled egyptian ship was raising sail to begin the voyage north all was so peaceful bright and calm our tribulations of the previous night seemed small and insignificant and very far away i looked up and down the riverbank green fringed with the stately plumes of river grass as far as the eye could see while i was standing there i felt something bump against my leg i looked down to see a piece of wood from the wrecked boat floating out from the canal and tangled by its broken strap my bundle of parchments good news my friend crowed wazim cheerily god has returned your writings to you i wish he had taken better care of them i replied lifting the soggy bundle from the stream ink tinted water leaked from the corner of the bag the pages inside would be a blackstained mushy mess i had neither the heart to open the bundle nor to throw it away so i knotted the strap and slung the sodden load over my shoulder once again and we started off by wazims reckoning we were some way south of the quay so we started walking along the rivers edge quickly finding a cattle path which climbed up the bank and onto higher ground the city wall angled away on a line running east away from the river which bent around a broad rising bluff of honeycoloured stone my wet clothes began to dry in the sun and although i was exhausted i found my spirits soaring every step brought me closer to a glad reunion with padraig sydoni and yordanus and that much closer to home the holy rood was heavy on my shoulder but i did not mind the weight considering what the saviour king had endured on my behalf i would have carried it from one end of the world to the other and back after a while we came to a cluster of huts fronting small green fields of beans melons onions and garlic smoke from the morning cook fires drifted across the trail and i could smell bread and meat cooking the scent made my stomach rumble reminding me that i had not eaten in some time i stopped and looked around wazim asked why we were stopping do you think we might beg something to eat i wondered yes he said glancing around but not here he started away again why i wondered is it because they are muhammedans worse said wazim lowering his voice they are pagans idol worshippers very bad people how can you tell it seemed like an ordinary holding to me there were thousands along the wide winding river he would say no more so we moved on passing through one small settlement after another until coming upon yet another where wazim stopped there are copts here he declared how can you tell a true copt never dwells beyond sight of a church extending his hand he said see i looked where he was pointing and saw a small white building with a bellshaped dome topped by a tiny crude iron cross otherwise the building was completely unremarkable in any way we will soon have something to eat we made our way to the little church where wazim rapped on the door which appeared to be little more than scrap wood and bits of planking rescued from the river his summons was answered by an old man with a long white beard and a black robe which covered him from the chin down one eye was sunken the socket hollow and the other was watery and dim but he greeted us with a toothless smile pressing his hands together and bowing wazim did likewise and the two of them held a brief but intense discussion filled with much gesturing and pointing the old priest raised his head brayed and spat and then grasping me by the arm he led us along the cramped beaten earth street to a tiny hovel of a house where he pounded on the door with the flat of his hand a woman pulled back the door and peered out just her nose and one eye showing the priest spoke a few words to her and she closed the door it opened again a moment later and a hand appeared holding two eggs the old copt took the eggs blessed the woman and we continued on this ritual was repeated at the next house where we were given three round floppy pieces of flat bread and two green onions after three more houses we had amassed another egg and some salt four dried figs a slice of fresh melon and a handful of honeyed dates whereupon i called a halt to the foraging and told wazim to thank the priest for helping us after exchanging a few words wazim reported he will accept no thanks for allowing his people the blessing of giving succour to strangers in need today they have earned a great reward in heaven then offer them a blessing i replied tell him gold and silver have i none but what i possess i share freely the blessing of the three to be aiding you abiding with you and showering peace and plenty on you and on your people each day all day and forever the old priest liked this blessing and made wazim repeat it twice so he would remember it we took our leave and found a place on the high bank overlooking the river to eat our meal i flattened some of the tall grass and made a place for the rood so that it would not rest on bare ground then i sat down beside it tired to the bone and began to eat the eggs had been boiled so we peeled them and dipped them in the salt likewise the green onions after such a long fast the plain and simple fare tasted better to me than a banquet i sat feeling the sun warm on my back as i gazed out across the river and thought about the welcome i would soon receive and beyond that to the journey ahead by this time tomorrow i thought we would be well on our way home after our meal we moved on as much as i would have liked to rest even a few moments longer i was a thousand times more anxious to rejoin padraig and the others brushing the crumbs from my lap i rose reluctantly adjusted my bundle of ruined parchments shouldered the rood and declared that if we were to reach the ship by midday we would have to hurry we walked on a short distance and crested the bluff coming in sight of the city walls once more and just beyond the great sweeping bend in the river i could see the wharf and the wide avenue leading to the city gates somewhere down there amidst the dark clusters of ships and boats lining the busy quayside yordanus ship persephone was waiting to carry me out of egypt beyond the walls smoke rose in twin columns from the centre of the city that one wazim told me is the covered market and the other it seemed to arise from the base of a high stony bank which dominated the northern quarter ah that is from the citadel it could easily have been the palace that was set on fire instead i realized the risk wazim had taken in coming back for me thank you wazim kadi i told him it was a brave thing you did last night i am forever in your debt he made a little bow saying i did only what one christian would do for another no i corrected thinking of all the betrayal deceit and disloyalty i had seen you did far more than that believe me you risked your life for me and i am grateful i will not forget it the cattle trails and pathways ran continuously along the niles lofty banks linking one small riverside settlement to the next north and south on both sides of the river as far as the eye could see we passed through the little holdings and wazim unfailingly greeted each and every person we met an old woman bent double beneath a bundle of straw fully as big as herself two naked boys carrying a string offish between them a man carrying a jug of milk in one hand leading a cow with the other and bearing his young daughter on his back women on their way to market carrying brown ducks bound with string wazim greeted them all and i remembered just how much i had missed in my long captivity as midday approached so did the quayside the trails and pathways became roads and grew busier the nearer the city gates we came i had been searching for yordanus ship since sighting the river harbour and as we came onto the quay i caught sight of the familiar red mast rising amidst the untidy forest of rigging at the far end of the wharf my steps quickened as i pushed through the crush of people thronging the docks dragging wazim in my wake i was almost running by the time i saw the bright green hull and yellow keel of the persephone panting and sweating i paused to catch my breath before hailing those on board go on daounk urged wazim excitedly they are waiting for you it is a long time since i ran like this i said lowering the rood gently to the wharf let me wipe the sweat from my brow at least as i did so i heard a familiar voice call out duncan glancing up i saw padraig standing at the rail he waved to me and then called to someone on the deck of the ship before starting over the rail my heart leapt and i started forwards to meet him on the wharf and then another face appeared above the rail and the sight halted me in midstep gislebert the templar sergeant at the same moment i saw two more templars standing on the wharf below the prow turning to wazim i said quick wazim do exactly as i say take the rood stay here and guard it with your life i will explain later whatever happens do not give it to anyone understand perfectly my friend taking the rough length of timber from me he planted himself on the wharf i turned took a halfdozen steps and was caught up in padraigs strong embrace hallelujah he cried fastening his arms around me and lifting me off my feet you are alive and well duncan all praise to the swift sure hand and his preserving power my joy at seeing padraig once again was sharply cramped by gisleberts watchful presence i turned to padraig and with true thanksgiving in my heart started at once for the ship leaving poor wazim to look on with a profoundly bewildered expression but there was nothing for it as much as he deserved to be included in the celebrations i could not imperil the precious relic by allowing the templars so much as a glimpse of itat least not until i saw how matters stood aboard ship i knew you would come for me i told padraig squeezing out the words between his fierce hugs and bonerattling slaps on the back i never doubted oh duncan duncan he said grabbing my face in both his hands look at you now earth and sky bear witness it seems as if you had just walked down to the end of the quay and here you are back again hale and hearty as ever are you well brother before i could answer he said there is so much to tell you how i have prayed to see this day he laughed aloud shaking his head in happy disbelief praise the saving god of grace praise him all you heavenly hosts the son who was lost is found praise him you burningeyed angels you saints give voice and sing listen padraig i said breaking in hating to stifle his happiness it is good to see you too but there is something i must tell you before we board the ship he looked at me blinking in merriment speak brother i will listen all day to hear the sound of your voice i am in earnest padraig hear me the priest became serious go on then i am listening we were nearly at the ship there is no time to explain we must leave cairo as soon as possible we must get rid of gislebert and the templarssend him on an errand and cast off at once that soon even sooner would be better the priest accepted this without question so be it duncan the voice drew my glance it was yordanus waving his arms and calling out to me in glad welcome standing next to him was his darkhaired daughter sydonis smile was more subtle i could not tell whether she was happy to see me or merely amused by my dishevelled appearance duncan my son my son he snatched me up and clasped me to his bosom the instant i clambered over the rail and onto persephones deck thanks be to god you are safe and here you are at last the old mans eyes began to fill with tears at long last here you are he embraced me warmly god and all his angels be praised you are safe he patted me on the shoulder and arms as if to reassure himself that i was indeed returned in the flesh welcome duncan said sydoni her voice soft and low she smiled and demurely offered her cheek it is good to see you safe compared to her fathers effusive welcome hers not only lacked warmth but was ambivalent as wellthough not from any timidity i thought for the glance of her dark eye was as proud as ever braving her coolness i gave her a kiss on the cheek and pressed her hand in mine it is good to see you sydoni gislebert who had been standing a little apart watching now stepped before me extending his hand he said praise god my friend we have been working for your release these many days i took his hand and thanked him we are only glad you are free indeed yes said yordanus breaking in you were never forgotten for a moment i can assure you welcome duncan he said seizing my hand the old trader beamed with good pleasure and danced from one foot to the other unable to contain himself welcome my boy praise christ our mighty redeemer is this all you have with you asked gislebert indicating my crude bundle of soggy parchments yes i told him i kept a record of my imprisonment and i hoped to bring it out with me alas they are ruined allow me to have a look said padraig lifting the sodden sling from me and who was that with you on the wharf gislebert said looking back towards the crowded quayside for someone who was only glad for my freedom the templar sergeant seemed unduly concerned with the particulars of my release that is wazim i replied truthfully enough a guide who helped me find the ship how did you know we were waiting with the ship he could not keep the suspicion out of his tone yordanus and padraig both heard it and regarded the templar with disapproval sydoni however appeared interested to hear my reply leaning against the rail in a crisp blue mantle her arms folded over her breast she lifted an eyebrowa sceptical judge inviting me to make my best explanation how else would we come for him yordanus chided stepping forwards quickly he embraced me again come let us celebrate the return of our friend padraig let us fill the cups and drink to his safe return forgive me gislebert said haughtily i merely wished to know if you had seen commander de bracineaux how should i have seen him i asked smiling was he looking for me when the riots began he went to the palace to see if he might rescue you the sergeant answered i imagined that was how you were freed i pray something has not gone wrong suggested padraig quickly the canny priest had seen his chance and taken it perhaps you should see what has happened to him gislebert frowned with indecision he disliked the turn things had taken but was not quick enough to see how to forestall the thing i think the priest is right added yordanus innocently yes go at once gislebert he may need you my orders were to wait here with you the sergeant replied dully and you have done that said sydoni suddenly she stepped forwards took his arm and turned him towards the rail all is well thanks to you and the good commanders vigilance we can fend for ourselves hereat least long enough for you to see if your help is required elsewhere sergeant gisleberts frown deepened at sydonis gentle leading he found himself at the rail unable to disagree he said very well if you think do not worry about us sydoni told him you must consider your duty to your commander now no doubt he will welcome word of duncans return suggested padraig it would be well to tell him as soon as possible lest he trouble himself unnecessarily the templar climbed reluctantly over the rail i will inform the commander that duncan has returned he said and with a last dubious look at me he dropped to the wharf he called the two templars on the dock to accompany him and the three of them hurried away together we watched until they were out of sight yordanus i said how soon can the ship be made ready to sail taken aback by the question he hesitated you want to leave but the commander will be exp how soon i insisted well as soon as we can lay in some provisions he replied thoughtfully i know you must be anxious to we can get provisions along the way said sydoni to me she said we can cast off at once if that is what you wish we cannot leave commander de bracineaux here without at least began yordanus father i think duncan is attempting to avoid the templars sydoni said looking to me for confirmation it is true i confessed i know you have laboured mightily on my behalf but i fear i must ask you to aid me a little longer there is some deceit at work here and i fear de bracineaux is not to be trusted we must leave at once the pilot is sleeping below sydoni said i will wake him you and padraig make ready to cast off i was puzzled by the sudden change in her disposition but there was no time to wonder about it just then i will fetch wazim i told padraig already sliding over the rail begin casting off i hastened back to where i had left wazim and found him sitting crosslegged on the dock his eyes closed the sacred relic nowhere to be seen where is the rood i demanded sharply what have you done with it calm yourself my friend he smiled and stood and i saw that he had been sitting on it may god forgive me he chuckled bending to retrieve the sacred object but what thieves do not see they do not steal stripping off my mantle i quickly wrapped it around the holy cross and then we hurried back to the ship the pilot and his two crewmen had been roused and were lazily going about the task of getting the ship ready to sail yordanus and the others already knew wazim of course and they welcomed him and asked what had caused our delay we expected you last night said yordanus leaving wazim to explain i went to secure the rood below deck curious padraig started to follow but i asked him to stay behind and keep anyone from intruding on me i will tell you everything i promised just as soon as we have put this city behind us i descended the short wooden steps aware that sydoni was watching me all the while i hid the rood among the baskets of stores and supplies in the hold of the ship and then rejoined the others on deck i stood at the rail and nervously watched the quay for any sign of the templars but de bracineaux did not appear a few moments later persephone pushed away from the dock and we left cairo behind for good and forever fortyfour the greenbordered nile spread its slow gentle curves before us bearing swift persephone north to alexandria and the sea i stood at the bow as the tiny riverbank settlements receded and watched the twin columns of smoke rising in the distanceall that could be seen of cairo now and soon that was gone too blended and vanished in the heavy blue summer haze leaving the rail i descended to the hold retrieved the prize and rejoined the others gathered around the mast where wazim kadi had been telling them about our escape from the palace yordanus and sydoni were seated on cushions and padraig reclined on his elbow on a rug listening to the little jailer as he spun the dull dross of our ordinary trials into the gleaming gold of great adventure and this wazim said proudly waving his hand with a grand flourish as i lay the bundle on the rug before the seated listeners this is the holy rood of christ rescued from the treasure house of khalifa alhafiz padraig rolled up onto his knees and yordanus and sydoni leaned forwards eagerly as i slowly unwrapped the sacred relic i pulled away the cloth to reveal the dark deeply grooved length of ancient timber padraig gasped and reached out a hand hesitated and stopped short go on i said the priest lowered his hand and with trembling fingers stroked the agepolished wood the sunlight revealed a feature in the wood i had never seen beforea narrow cleft sharp and very deep in the centre of the piece much i imagine like that which would be made by driving a spike into the wood padraigs fingers found the cleft and he gasped again on this rough beam our blessed saviour king the holy one of god shed his lifeblood for our redemption he said his voice losing solidity as the tears began to stream down his cheeks see here he said this rough beam bears witness that our hope is not in vain pressing his finger to the hole in the wood the weeping priest said here the cruel spike was driven which split the vein divided bone and sinew and slew the blessed jesu but the wisdom of the all wise father encompasses things undreamed in human hearts in him all divisions are united all torn and broken lives made whole through the nailriven body the rent between time and eternity is joined in the dying of the only begotten life everlasting is born for the swift sure hand did not leave him in the grave but raised him up and all who cling to this black and holy rood shall likewise be raised up on the final day we were silent then for a time gazing on the holy object filling our eyes with the homely crudeness of the relic even as we filled our hearts with the certain knowledge of gods power to bend all things to his redeeming purpose we heard in antioch that the rood was lost yordanus said after a long silence i never expected to see it with my own eyes he too lowered his hand and reverently stroked the roodmuch i expect as people have done since that morning when the women ran from the empty tomb to tell the twelve that the masters corpse was missing for the faithful it is a natural response like that of lovers linking hands to reverence the beloved with a touch thank you duncan he said his eyes growing misty i know i shall not abide this world much longer papa no chided sydoni gently look at me he said it is the simple truth i am an old man but i will go to my reward with a better courage now thanks to duncan all gratitude goes to you yordanus i replied if not for you i would still be a prisoner and the rood would be lost to the world not at all he replied waving off the compliment our friend renaud was working tirelessly on your behalf from the very first his words did not square with what i had seen of de bracineaux in the caliphs treasure house but i held my tongue and let him finish i see now why you wished to leave cairo without delay yordanus said but maybe now you will not mind telling me why you were so anxious to leave the templars behind when i hesitated he said was it because you feared they would take it from you if they knew i had it nothing would stop them trying to get it back but it rightly belongs to them yordanus pointed out at least it belongs in antioch i heartily disagreed but did not have it in me to dispute yordanus so instead i said tell me how you knew to look for me in cairo ah now that is a tale in itself said padraig making himself comfortable but if we are going to tell it sydoni said then i will fetch the cups wazim liked the sound of that and scurried off to help her returning a few moments later with his arms full of round wheellike loaves and two jugs of wine sydoni followed with a wooden tray on which were stacked a number of bowls one of them was filled with olive oil and crushed garlic and another had salt mixed with black pepper she set the tray on the deck and handed around the cups at first we did not know you had been taken yordanus confessed pouring wine into his bowl he passed the jar to me i poured and handed it to padraig we thought you were right behind as we raced to escape the seljuqs and it was not until padraig looked back that we discovered you were no longer with us would that i had looked back sooner said padraig passing the jar to wazim sydoni meanwhile had begun breaking bread into another of the bowls which she then ranged before us by the time we rode back to find you she said the seljuqs had taken you we found your horse added yordanus but that was all there was nothing for it but to ride back to anazarbus for help he shook his head sadly what a terrible terrible business why i asked it was exactly what i would have done if our places had been reversed the seljuqs did not content themselves with destroying bohemonds army yordanus replied solemnly they decided to punish the armenians for withholding the tribute they attacked the city it must have happened just after we departed there were seljuqs inside the city already and as the royal family and nobles were attending to prince leos funeral it was a simple matter to bar the church doors and take over the garrison those who resisted were killed sydoni added sadly yordanus took a piece of bread and dipped it in the olive oil and then the salt chewed thoughtfully and said although there was very little resistance what about roupen and his family i asked a weight of sorrow beginning to descend upon me a great many people fled the city padraig said we met them on the road and they told us the royal family had been killed at their prayersalthough this was far from certain no one knew anything for certain save that the seljuqs were in command sydoni offered me the bowl of bread they had closed the gates and no one was allowed in or out of the city we had no choice but to turn around and ride for mamistra said padraig it is an eightday journey as you knowwell we made it in six and regretted every day that it kept us from finding you i wish there had been another way but what else could we do our best hope lay in getting to antioch as swiftly as possible as soon as we reached mamistra we sailed for saint symeon and then hastened to antioch to alert the garrison there what had happened bohemonds defeat left antiochs defences decimated yordanus observed the idiot prince had taken his entire force leaving only the templars behind it was a foolish foolish thing mark my words he will answer for it before the judgement throne on the last day i nodded dipping my bread and began to chew glumly amir ghazi realized his great good fortune i told them he did not waste a moment but marched directly to damascus to rally support for an attack on antioch aye agreed yordanus readily we were there when it came commander de bracineaux sent to jerusalem for troops to help defend the city we spent a fair few anxious days wondering which army would reach antioch firstthe templars or seljuqs said padraig in the end it was the templars who arrived first but amir ghazi was close behind the city had but two days to prepare and then the seljuqs appeared and promptly mounted a siege at first it was not so bad but as the siege wore on a plague of dysentery broke out and good water became difficult to find if relief had not come from jerusalem added sydoni pouring more wine for me i do not know what we would have done we ate our bread and sipped our wine and though it felt strange to me after spending so much time imprisoned on my own i found myself gradually adjusting to the pleasures of human companionship once more peculiar too i thought to hear someone speak of events that intimately concerned me but which i knew only in part i looked at those gathered around me glancing from one face to the next silently thanking them for their fealty and perseverance on my behalf yordanus keen as a youth slender still wearing his age but lightly and beside him sydoni she of the dark hair and soulful eyes distant watchful a secret waiting to be known wazim smiling his brown head bobbing traversing an uncertain world with quiet courage and bountiful good will and padraig true friend of my soul wise guide and boon companion for a pilgrimage or a lifetime i was blessed beyond measure and as the sun warmed my back and the wine warmed my stomach i knew myself to be held in the strong arms of a love greater than any i could have thought or imagined what happened i asked suddenly wishing the day would never end that i could sit with these friends forever just like this and time would cease after the templars left jerusalem yordanus replied king baldwin sent to jaffa and acre for troops to help protect the holy city in their absence they were a long time coming because soldiers are needed everywhere these days and few can be spared he shook his head ruefully bohemonds profligate stupidity will cost the holy land dearly and for years to come eventually baldwin succeeded in raising enough of an army to relieve antioch said padraig taking up the tale the siege lasted longer than ghazi anticipated and by the time baldwin arrived most of the seljuq support had dwindled away the rest fled at the sight of baldwins troops even though there were fewer than seven hundred knights in all the seljuqs have no heart for a pitched battle wazim put in stand up to them and they turn tail and run they are cowardly dogs all of them god knows it is true agreed yordanus no one was happier than we were to see baldwin riding through the gates of the city leading the crusaders in triumphall the more since he brought word that a few of bohemonds knights had survived the massacre and these were taken to damascus to be ransomed the seljuqs set a high price on the survivorsten thousand dinars i still have many old friends in damascus and we made arrangements to go there at oncewhich we did unfortunately things did not go well for us in damascus we encountered great difficulty in getting reliable information from the atabegs courtiers they told us you were there and they would release you if i paid the ransom but when i brought the money they could not find you he paused shaking his head we feared you had been executed prisoners without ransom are often killed for the pleasure of their captors offered wazim but then renaud arrived said padraig he came to damascus i could not keep the suspicion out of my voice sydoni marked my distrust with a knowing expression although no one else seemed to notice why also to ransom prisoners yordanus replied it was fortunate for us that he came when he did because he was able to discover what had happened to you yes i thoughtno doubt the fidain told him to yordanus i said you learned i had been taken to cairo and so we came on as soon as we could when did you arrive seven days ago said padraig i tried to work out in my mind what day that would have been but i could no longer remember where one day left off and another began then you were here before the trouble started wazir hasan slaughtered the amirs but two days ago wazim said yes agreed yordanus that was when the trouble began i see i knew in my bones i was right about renaud but i did not care to speak ill of him before yordanus who was his friend you look troubled said padraig is something wrong i am tired i said i have not talked so much in a long time i had forgotten how taxing it can be you should rest now suggested sydoni there are quarters below deck where you will not be disturbed she rose come with me i will show you yes go with her we can talk again this evening the old man said sydoni make him comfortable i rose to my knees and taking up the black rood placed it in padraigs handsalong with the responsibility of looking after it do you think you might find a safe place for this gladly and with honour he said accepting the precious relic with a bow of respect i retrieved my mantle and followed sydoni forwards to a hatch in the deck with wooden steps leading down to a small bare room set apart from the larger holding area below deck where cargo and stocks of provisions were kept quiet and darkthe only light came from a small grated opening in the deck aboveit was the room she and her father shared and it contained two low straw pallets set in boxes between the great curving ribs of the ships hull the pallets were spread with linen cloths and cushions to make a soft inviting bed i thanked her and sat down on the edge of the box to remove my boots she watched me for a moment making no move to leave i owe you a very great debt of gratitude you and your father i told her i intend to repay youat least i mean to try she smiled there is no need i thanked her again but instead of leaving me to sleep she sat down on the edge of the box beside me and i caught a beguiling whiff of sweet sandalwood and spice from her clothes and hair you are worried about de bracineaux she arched an eyebrow as if daring me to contradict her is it so obvious not to my father perhaps she allowed but he tends to see only what he wants to see and you sydoni what do you see i see a man who winces every time the templars name is breathed aloud i do not wince like an old woman with a toothache an old woman i did not care for her choice of comparison she laughed and the sound charmed even as it humbled it is something to do with the holy rood yes i admitted i know that much is obvious she nodded waiting for me to say more when i did not she sniffed well you do not have to say anything if it taxes you overmuch i want to tell you it is just that it is not so easily told people only say that she observed tartly when they cannot decide how much to leave out i had forgotten how very changeable she could be like intemperate weather sydoni could be mild and calm one moment and hurling thunderbolts the next if i thought to leave anything out i replied quickly losing my patience it was only to spare your feelings my feelings she held her head to one side and regarded me as if i were mad i have no feelings for commander de bracineaux your fathers feelings then i know they are friends teh you demand that we depart cairo with unseemly haste she snapped for the purpose of eluding the templars and now you think to protect my fathers finer feelings i was tired and it was futile arguing with her in any event i suspect the templars are in league with the fidain i told her i knew it she cried seizing my arm in her excitement i knew he was lying to us the good and kind de bracineaux lying through his wicked teeth needless to say her reactiongratifying as it was in its shameless intensitytook me aback he told us he was doing all he could to secure your release she said the words tumbling out in a rush when father grew impatient he told us to wait and pray and leave everything to him that negotiations had reached a precarious stagethe least word or action out of place and we would risk losing everything he said liesit was all lies and that was when yordanus approached the copts i surmised indeed it was his first thought sydoni replied he wanted to make contact with them the day we arrived but had promised de bracineaux he would let the templars try first after waiting three days he and padraig decided that it would harm nothing to have our friends look into matters the copts of cairo she added proudly have been living with the saracens a very long time they have many influential contacts throughout the city if not for your friends i declared i have no doubt i would still be a prisoner in the caliphs palace de bracineaux did not care about meat least i was far from foremost in his thoughts he wanted the holy rood sydoni said you were just an excuse to help him get it he used you just as he used my father she regarded me wonderingly but how did you discover he was with the fidain i saw them together i yawned exhaustion overcoming me they were trying to break into the treasure house to recover the rood yesthat is i believe that is what they were after she stood abruptly sleep now i will wake you for supper sydoni i said and realized how much i enjoyed saying her name please do not tell yordanus about my suspicions we must tell him we cannot keep it from him i know but let us wait until tonight at least i want padraig to hear it too very well she agreed tonight then she closed the door and i heard her climb the wooden steps and then her soft footfall on the deck above i lay back on the softcushioned bed my head in the place where sydoni lay her head and i fell asleep to the slow and gentle rocking of the ship beneath me and the scent of sandalwood drifting through my dreams fortyfive i awoke to a cool touch on my forehead and a warm breath in my ear i had slept long and deep and roused myself with difficulty when i finally opened my eyes sydoni was gone and i wondered if i had dreamed her i pulled on my boots and climbed back to the upper deck emerging into a sky of radiant deepflamed red and gold with darker shades of sapphire in the east where the first stars were already shining low green egyptian hills were gliding slowly past and goat bells across the water tinkled as the shepherd led his flock to the fold for the night sydoni was kneeling before a low charcoal brazier cooking red fish on latticework spits she ladled olive oil over the meat which made the glowing coals sizzle and flare and threw a delicious silvery cloud of smoke into the air when the flames died down she squeezed half the juice of a yellow lemon over the fish glancing up at me as she did so her smile was ready and welcoming good evening she said it smells wonderful i told her she held out a bowl of large flat yellow seeds try these i tipped a few into my mouth and munched them they had a salty flavour nice parched squash seeds the farmers make them they also make this she said and taking up a large earthenware jar poured a clear amber liquid into a large copper cup the liquid frothed up with a white foam and i smelled the flowery scent of good fresh ale as i raised the bowl to my lips they call it tears of the crocodile ol by another name i said savouring the sweet bitter nutlike taste as it slid effortlessly down my throat how long had it been since i had last lifted a cup of ale the egyptians say they invented ale sydoni said then shrugged lightly but they say that about everything padraig insists the celts were first to make itbut he says that about everything i sipped the bittersweet brew with satisfaction and breathed the soft fragrant air deep into my lungs where is padraig he went below to say his prayers she turned the fish on the charcoal and squeezed more of the lemon over it vespers before the holy rood he said the dreamer awakes called yordanus i turned as he came up from the stern where he had been talking to his pilot padraig and wazim were not about i feel as if i could take on an army i said i hope you can eat like one said sydoni my father has decreed a celebration to honour your rescue we stopped a little while ago at a market and bought everything in the settlement we want to honour your return as the occasion merits he said god bless you duncan but it is good to see you i am sorry if i cannot refrain from saying it i do not mean to embarrass you but it is good to see you again and you yordanus i replied please it does not embarrass me in the least indeed there were times i thought i would not be seeing you or anyone else ever again we talked of my captivity in the caliphs palace already time was at work blunting the sharp edges of that existence and bathing it in softer hues is that why you wrote it down asked sydoni i noticed how naturally she slipped in beside me and remembered how much i missed her simple womanly graces just so i affirmed and then remembered what had happened to it in the stream but i fear it is ruined now i will just have to remember as best i can without it perhaps not said padraig as he joined us and i saw he was holding one of the scrolls from my bundle this papyrus is remarkable in many ways see here he peeled back a portion of the scroll to reveal the still damp surface the ink has washed away it is true but a stain remains i looked forlornly at the faint grey marks it cannot be read like that no agreed padraig casually but it can be copied the monks of ayios moni excel in such work they are always copying old scrolls and parchments we can take your book to them yordanus suggested eagerly papa said sydoni you presume too much perhaps duncan does not wish to return with us to cyprus no the old mans face fell but he recovered himself quickly of course i was forgetting myself my friends you have only to say where you wish to go and this ship will take you there he looked from me to padraig expectantly well i think said sydoni touching my arm lightly with her fingertips it would be best to tell father what you told me i nodded and drew a reluctant breath i think none of us should return to cyprus just yet i began i have reason to believe that de bracineaux and his men are in league with the fidain impossible scoffed yordanus you are surely mistaken commander de bracineaux would never contemplate such a thing if there is another explanation i will gladly hear it and repent if i am wrong but i know what i saw this news proved so distressing to yordanus that sydoni suggested we all sit down and discuss it together over our cups the meal will be a little time yet let us get this unpleasantness behind us before we eat wazim roused himself from his nap as we filled our cups but declined to join us as we sat down on the rugs beside the mast sydoni put him to work helping prepare the meal instead i related what sydoni had told me about de bracineauxs insistence on negotiating with the caliph himself if he sought audience with the caliph i never learned of it i told them the first i knew of his presence was when i saw him in the tunnel helping the fidain break into the treasure house are you certain they were fidain i did not know who they were i replied and explained that it was wazim who identified them from my description he might have been mistaken yordanus pointed out it is possible no it is possible i allowed i called across to wazim and asked him if he had any doubt about who we had seen breaking into the treasure house no my lord he replied they were the hashishin but you did not see them wazim did you asked yordanus you did not see them with your own eyes i did not need to see them he said i could smell them they smelled of the hashish smoke much of the city was in flames last night the old man pointed out shrewdly how could you be certain it was the hashish he had sown the seed of doubt but i remained convinced i asked wazim if anyone had come to the caliphs court to arrange ransom for me no my lord he replied again no one ever came might someone have come without your knowing wondered yordanus although his manner was tactful and kindly i could see what he was doing and it made me uncomfortable had i been too hasty in my judgement of the templars perhaps imprisonment had soured my good opinion of renaud i am a good jailer the little man answered i make it my business to know such things if anyone came seeking ransom for one of my prisoners i would know of it but no one ever came to the palace to offer ransom who approached you on my behalf wazim i asked father shenoute sent word and summoned me that is the holy patriarch of the cairo church explained padraig when renaud seemed to have trouble arranging the audience with the caliph yordanus and i went to the patriarch and asked if he could help father shenoute made a few inquiries and found that wazim was well placed to help us wazim nodded father shenoute said i would be doing gods will if i helped daounk to gain his freedom when the riots began i saw my chance and took it there you see said yordanus it might all have been a mistake i might simply have succeeded where the templars failed it does not mean they intended betraying you in any way i conceded the point it may be as you say i granted but one thing bothers me still if they only wished to help gain my freedom why did they go to the treasure house first when given the chance why did they not seek my release i suppose they hoped to secure the holy rood said yordanus that very thing above all else i said trying to keep an even temper can you blame them said yordanus it belongs to the church at antioch blundering bohemond lost it and they have a sacred duty to get it back they chose the relic above my life i said yet they told you nothing about that part of their enterprise why would they hide it from you yordanus spread his hands that is something we must ask commander de bracineaux when next we see him what do you propose padraig asked i could tell from his tone and glance that he like myself was uneasy with the prospect of allowing the templars to get their hands on the holy relic again my friends i believe this has been an unfortunate misunderstanding i propose we sail home to cyprus and with your kind indulgence i will send word to renaud to come and meet us in famagusta to discuss these matters after all he said the good commander renaud helped us immeasurably in damascus before condemning him we owe him a hearing i think sydoni came and called us to our dinner then and no more was said about the matter that night it did not sit well with me but i tried not to let it spoil the festive mood which yordanus and sydoni strove to instil in the evenings celebration after a few more bowls of ale and sydonis delicious banquet i succeeded in putting my doubts about renaud and the templars to one side and enjoyed myself despite the troubling black cloud of foreboding hanging over me the meal was an inspiration of wholesome flavours prepared simply to allow the unadorned beauty of each dish to please with its own particular appeal there was fish and slow roasted peppers with garlic olives herbed flat bread made by the village women andmy favouritelittle chunks of lamb soaked in olive oil sprinkled with dried herbs and roasted with tiny onions over the coals on slender wooden skewers we sat on the deck and talked and ate as night deepened around us the flickering fires of passing houses and settlements spangled the river banks even as the stars dusted the sky above with glowing shards of light the moon rose late and spilled its light onto the water to turn the lazily swirling liquid into molten silver after a time yordanus bade us good night and went to his bed then padraig and wazim likewise leaving me alone with sydoni we talked long into the night enjoying the balmy air and the gentle music of the water rippling along the keel and steering paddle the pilot kept the ship in the deep midriver channel from time to time one of the crewmen would come to relieve him and he would lie down on his mat in the stern for a time only to awaken a little later to take the tiller once more it was a fine night for sailing and i was glad to be out on the water looking up into the great bowl of the heavens and the starflecked sky with no bound or hindrance in any direction as far as the eye could see i began at last to understand that i was truly free some time later sydoni bade me good night and went to her bed but i remained on deck gazing up at the stars and listening to the sound of the dark river as the ship slid along the slowly winding waterway towards the sea i slept a little towards dawn but woke again at sunrise and went at once to the stern the sky was bright pink in the east with grey shading to blue above and not a cloud to be seen the river had broadened considerably during the night and the nearest bank was now a fair distance away there were no ships behind us but two smaller boats kept pace one behind the other just ahead i asked the pilot how long they had been there and he said they had joined us at sunrise they are fishing boats he told me in crude latin do not worry my friend no one follows us i thanked him but did not relax my vigil keeping watch through that day and the next only when we had put sweltering alexandria behind us and entered the deep blue waters of the mediterranean sea did i dare to believe we had made good our escape once under full sail i allowed myself to rejoice in the knowledge that despite the combined efforts of the seljuqs and the saracens i was on my way home the voyage to cyprus was swift and fair the weather though hot was fine for sailing and thanks to a favourable wind and bright cloudless nights we reached cyprus in only three days while the island was yet but a bluebrown hump looming in the sea haze i prevailed upon yordanus not to put in at famagusta but to use another port instead but why he asked genuinely mystified by my distrust and uneasiness although i could think of several extremely compelling reasons to avoid cyprus altogether i merely replied i would feel safer if our return was not widely known just yet but where is the danger the old trader countered innocently i am certain the caliph has more important matters on his mind than the escape of a solitary prisoner still if it would ease your mind i will have a word with the magistrate and he will put the garrison on watch for a few days father sydoni scolded we both know the magistrate is an officious gossip and meddler the garrison is only a dozen old war dogs who bark far worse than they ever bite to me she said we have a small house in paphos on the other side of the island we can stay there for as long as you like yordanus rolled his eyes and sighed heavily but yielded to his daughter without further comment i spoke to the pilot who arranged it so that we did not make landfall until just after sunset i wanted our arrival to arouse as little interest as possible accordingly once ashore we moved quickly through the lower busy sea town and up the hill into a quieter quarter known as nea paphos where scattered in amongst the large new estates of wealthy planters and merchants the ruins of ancient fortresses and the crumbling palaces of longdead kings could still be seen among the gnarled olive trees and thorn thickets on the hillside the house yordanus kept here was less than a fourth the size of his great house in famagusta but it was more than adequate for our modest needs it was surrounded by a high whitewashed wall which one entered from the road by a single low wooden door once inside the visitor entered a tidy square of courtyard kept perpetually and immaculately swept free of dust by a fearsome little birdlike housekeeper named anna a single large fig tree grew in the centre of the yard surrounded by a few wooden benches in one corner was a well which supplied the houses needs anna let us in and complaining about the lack of a timely warning set about preparing a meal meanwhile i secured the door to the courtyard yordanus watched me with a bemused expression and when i was finished asked if i was satisfied it is stout enough i replied rattling the iron bar in its holder it will serve good let us join the others and drink to a fortuitous return as the main room of the house also served as kitchen anna would not allow us anywhere near the table until the food was ready she chased us all back out into the courtyard where padraig found a low bench and a number of stools which he quickly arranged in a loose circle sydoni appeared with a jug of wine and an assortment of carved olivewood cups she poured the wine and we all drank one anothers health and prosperity and long happy eventful lives what will you do now master wazim asked me i marked his use of that wordit was the second time he had called me that the first time was in the tunnel we will rest for a day or two i answered carelessly and then padraig and i will set about finding passage back to caithness in scotland i looked at the little copt who had been my solitary friend in the caliphs palace what about you wazimwhat will you do he thought for a moment if yordanus has no further need of me he said at last his voice heavy with resignation i will return to alexandria not cairo i said lightly oh i can never go back to cairo daounk he replied truly the khalifa would have me flayed alive and spitroasted over hot coals the little jailer had risked his life and given up his livelihood for me and i had tossed him aside like a rag on which i had just blown my nose i am sorry wazim forgive me i was not thinking there is nothing to forgive you must return to your own country i understand you have served me admirably and well as a true christian brother you have given unstintingly and at immense sacrifice for my benefit indeed i would not be here now if not for you i will not see your noble deed go unrewarded he smiled to hear himself praised from my lips i ask nothing of you daounk god himself has prepared my reward i have no doubt of it wazim my friend still it may be some time before you collect that reward it would please me to see you well settled and comfortable while you wait i glanced over to where padraig was sitting and saw that he was following our conversation my faithful anam cara he gave me a nod of approval to let me know that yet another skirmish with the slippery adversary pride had been contested successfully anna called us in to our supper then and we went in to a meal of eggs and peppers with dried fish wine and olives after the meal we remained at the table long into the night talking to yordanus and sydoni about how best to go about finding a ship to help us on our homeward journey as we talked it soon became apparent that yordanus was less than enthusiastic about our leaving he was intent on seeing de bracineaux and myself reconciled our differences mended and the holy rood returned to its rightful place i was against this i confess but felt deeply in yordanus debt and was heartily reluctant to grieve him over this difference of opinion we went to our beds that night with the matter unresolved but i promised to give it my thoughtful consideration over the next few days this pleased him and he said no more about it leaving me to my meditations next morning padraig and i with sydonis assistance wrapped the holy rood in red silk and secured it in a stout wooden casket which anna used to store her good shoes and feastday clothes we hid the sacred relic in the bottom of the box and replaced the clothes adding a few shawls a tablecloth and such like the box did not lock but sydoni said it was just as well someone searching for valuables will seize on anything that is locked she pointed out we placed the box under padraigs bed and satisfied that our treasure was safe enough for the time being walked down to the harbour in the lower town where we arranged to be informed of any westbound ships departing paphos harbour i had the unhappy suspicion that we would have to go to a larger port to find passage and that would increase the risk of discovery likewise each day we waited heightened the risk as well as i did not for a single instant believe that the templars would easily give up searching for the sacred relic nor allow anything to stand in their way of reclaiming it my sudden and unexplained appearance on the quay at cairo had confounded sergeant gislebert and i knew hi my bones that de bracineaux would quickly narrow his search to meif only to satisfy himself that i did not have the relic in my possession thus yordanus suggestion of sending word to him to meet us and discuss the matter had something to recommend it by way of surprise but beyond that try as i might i could not think of a single good reason to meet with the templars i did not say as much to yordanus however but merely begged more time to think the matter through take all the time you need the old man replied obligingly while you are thinking why not go up to the monastery and speak with the monks about restoring your damaged papyri it is not faryou would only be gone a few days and you could see something of cyprus along the way padraig agreed that it was a good idea so that is what we did fortysix the people of cyprus travel by donkey and although exceedingly undignified the sturdy little beasts are surefooted and uncomplaining they eat little and need less water than a horse or ox and can endure heat and cold and the hardships of the road far better than either of their larger stablemates we hired three of the animals in paphosone each for padraig and myself and one to carry fodder and provisions for our journey as yordanus said it was no great distance but the people of the hill country beyond paphos are very poor and the likelihood of finding suitable food or stabling along the way was slender indeed it is best i think to travel lightly and make as few demands on the country folk as possible was how yordanus tactfully put it so early the next morning we bundled a few things into a cloth bag and tied the bundle containing my stillsoggy papyripadraig had determined that the best way to preserve the mess was to keep it wrapped in damp sheepskinto the patient pack animal bidding farewell to yordanus wazim and sydoni we set off for the monastery of ayios moni a refuge of learning and prayer deep in the hill country on the edge of the high troodos mountains the road was wellused and well marked and the weather dry and fine so the travelling was easy upon reaching the first high ridge i looked back to see paphos glittering like a jewel in the shallow bowl of the bay shimmering in the bright morning sunlight it was good to be with padraig again just the two of us and i reflected that since beginning this pilgrimage it had never been just the two of us together we rode sidebyside and i told him about my captivity with amir ghazi as we climbed higher into the pineforested hills the air grew cooler and more pleasant the breeze through the tall trees smelled of pine and reminded me of the scottish woodlands and i felt a pang of longing which was eased only by the assurance that we would be going home very soon we spent a good day in the saddle stopping now and then to water the beasts from the roadside brook we passed a few tiny settlements and as yordanus had warned us they were mean placestumbledown sootcovered hovels with miserable dogs and dirty children standing in bare dirt yards looking silently and hungrily at us as we passed at one such dwelling padraig was so moved by the want of a naked boy and his young sister that he gave them half our bread some dried meat and all the cheese we had brought with us later as the sun began to sink into the green valley to the west we sought and found a clearing in the forest a short distance from the road where we made camp for the night we made a fire of fragrant pine branches and cooked a simple meal of pease porridge and slept on beds of pine needles with the stars shining down through the gaps in the lightly sighing trees we rose at daybreak and continued on arriving at our destination just as the monastery bell tolled vespers the gates were still open so we went in and presented ourselves to the porter they were greeks for the most part but we had no difficulty making ourselves understood padraig told the porter that he was also a priest and that we were on pilgrimage returning from the holy landwhereupon the simple monk became excited and ran off to find the abbot abbot demitrianos was a kindly and gentle man humble in manner and appearance with a head of wavy dark hair and a beard with two grey streaks either side of his mouth like the brothers under his care he dressed in a simple black robe that covered him from just below the chin to the tips of his toes and like all the others he wore a black brimless peaked cap sewn with a tiny white cross on the front over his brow around his neck he wore a wooden cross on a braided leather loop and he carried a short wooden staff in his hand demitrianos received us like cousins long lost and lamented and graciously welcomed us to the monastery he ordered the porter to prepare the guest lodge and said we are honoured to have someone who has been to the holy land perhaps if you are not too exhausted from your journey you might speak to us of your pilgrimage tonight at supper we would be most happy to share news of our travels with you padraig told him i must tell you however that owing to a great misfortune we did not reach jerusalem if you hoped to hear word of the holy city i fear we must disappoint you it makes no matter the abbot replied many of us have never travelled so far as lefkosia or salamis and some have never been beyond the next valley i am certain that anything you can tell us of the wider world will be respectfully and gratefully received the little monastery of ayios moni the good abbot told us was very old the first monks having come from byzantium over seven hundred years ago before that he said there was a temple to the goddess hera our chapel is built on the old temples foundations it is an ancient and holy place when padraig expressed an interest in hearing more about the monastery the abbot became our guide and led us to each of the buildings in turn and showed us the treasures of their brotherhood including the small much faded and it must be said extremely crude icon of the virgin mary which was believed to have been painted by none other than saint luke the evangelist upon viewing this marvel i did feel as if i had beheld a thing of immense age and undeniable consequence although i lack a proper appreciation of such things i do freely confess what impressed me most was not the plaintive image of the young woman with large dark melancholy eyes but rather the worshipful reverence with which the monks handled their priceless relic their loving veneration was heartfelt and deep and it shamed the arrogant crusaders with their careless desecration of the true cross the manifold profanations heaped upon that holy object by those who should have been its protectors amounted to a gross and terrible sacrilege the humble adoration of the monks renewed my resolve to keep the black rood as far from the templars grasping hands as i possibly could the monks of ayios moni lived a simple life of prayer and toil growing crops and vegetables raising chickens and sheepwhich they freely gave to the poor who came daily to their gates to beg for food and clothing they were skilled in the healing arts a practice for which they were justly renowned dispensing their potions and medicines far and wide as any had need they also tended vines from which they produced a sumptuous wine they served to their guests the wine was sweet and heavy and was reputed to possess curative powers because it was grown on hallowed ground the rules of their order forbade speaking during meals but in observance of our visit this rule was relaxed during our visit to allow them to listen to padraig and me describe our sojourn in the holy land in truth padraig did all the talking as his greek was far more eloquent than my own rough expression and he knew precisely what his fellow monks wanted to hear thus i sat with the abbot at the high table drinking my wine and eating a delicious stew of lamb and barley while padraig stood at the pulpit normally occupied by the brother reading the evenings lesson he spoke well adorning his talk with finelyobserved word portraits of the people and places we had seen he told them about my captivity among the seljuqs and saracens and my escapemaking it sound much more courageous than it felt at the timedrawing many appreciative murmurs from his listeners when he finished the entire communitythirtyfive or forty monks in all i thinkstood in his honour while the abbot thanked him with a special blessing following the meal we were invited to abbot demitrianos lodge for a special drink before night prayers we walked across the quiet monastery yard in the balmy twilight and i felt the deep peace of the place enfold me in its soft inescapable embrace the abbots house was little more than a bare cell but it had a hearth and a fleecelined bed several chairs and a table on which stood simple olivewood cups and an earthenware jar the abbot invited us to sit and poured a pale slightly cloudy white liquid into the cups which he passed to padraig and me he placed the palm of his hand over his cup and blessed the drink whereupon we imbibed the sweet fire of the ayios moni monks a delectable honeyed nectar that soothed even as it warmed beguiling the unwary with a delightful smoky taste before stinging the senses into a lucid and delectable dizziness after only a few sips i felt large and expansive friend and brother to all mankind it was with great reluctance that i set aside my cup but when talk turned to the reason for our visit i feared i might lose the power of speech if i drank any more of the wonderful elixir we have it on good authority i began as the kindly abbot watched me dreamily over the rim of his cup that your community excels in the making and copying of manuscripts it is replied demitrianos a task in which we have long experience if some small fame has travelled beyond these walls i am glad for it means that gods praise likewise increases as you know said padraig we have just arrived in cyprus from egypt where duncan was a prisoner for many months yes nodded the abbot with benign admiration you showed great fortitude and forbearance in your captivity he told me our lord was surely with you while he was a guest of the caliph padraig continued he wrote of his experiences i thought i would not live to see my young daughter i explained and wanted her to know what had happened to her father a thoughtful and commendable bequest mused the abbot loftily a very labour of love to be sure unfortunately i continued all my work was ruined i went on to tell him what had taken place in the escape from the caliphs palace leaving out any mention of the raid on the treasure house and the rescue of the holy rood abbot demitrianos frowned and clucked his tongue regrettable to be sure he reached for the jar and offered to refresh our cups more alashi i declined but padraig succumbed still the abbot continued tipping the jar into his own cup your life has been redeemed all praise to our great heavenly father and that is of inestimable value to your dear little daughter he raised his cup and imbibed deeply of the potent drink as it happens said padraig this work was written on good papyrus which the egyptians use instead of parchment we know of it to be sure replied the abbot contentedly we call it papuros fine stuff but very brittle and lacking the durability of good parchment i suppose however if you cannot obtain the sheep he sighed as if it were the chief lamentation of his life what can you do this is why we have come to you padraig said we have brought the papyri with us in the hope that the wise brothers of ayios moni can help restore what has been lost to be sure the abbot slid a little down in his chair he looked from one to the other of us with a slow blink of his eyes although it grieves me to tell you my friends experience tells me that nothing can be done papuros is very delicate as i say once ruined it cannot be salvaged he lifted the jar are you certain you will not have more alashi again i declined politely and was surprised when padraig helped himself emptying the jar into his cup i have no doubt that what you say is true the thirsty priest replied yet it seems to me that the work might be copied the bell for night prayers began tolling just then padraig stood ah night prayers i am keenly interested in attending the service tonight perhaps with your kind permission we might continue this discussion tomorrow i think if you were to have a look at the papyri you will see what i mean turning to me he said come duncan we must hurry to the chapel i thank you for your kindness and bid you gods rest tonight abbot the abbot blessed us with a benediction and sent us off to prayers we left him to his rest and as i closed the door behind us i noticed padraig still clutched his drink in his hand a lesser man would have surrendered long ago i told him a lesser man did he replied tipping the nearly full cup onto the ground he lay the empty vessel beside the door and we hurried to the chapel taking our places at the rear of the small assembly of monks there were two short benches either side of the door and upon one an elderly brother sat with his hands folded in his lap snoring softly all the rest stood with their hands raised palms upwards at shoulder height intoning the prayer in a humming drone padraig joined right in but i did not know the prayer and found it difficult to follow the recitation from time to time one of the monks would raise his voice and call out a phrase and just as i was beginning to grasp the prayer suddenly the chant would change and off they would go in a new direction after a while i gave up and sat down on the bench beside the sleeping brother until the service was over he woke as i sat down looked up blearily smiled at me and then went back to sleep i wished him pleasant dreams the guest lodge was comfortable enough if small we woke the next morning well rested and ready to be about our business after morning prayers we broke fast in the refectory with a meal of bread and honey ripe olives and soft goats cheese the brothers asked us to tell them more about our experiences in the holy land especially antioch where paul the great apostle and his companion barnabus the generous had preached and worked they came to cyprus too you know one of the elder brothers informed us paphos was the first city to become christian in all the old roman empire it is true verily added another you can still see where paul was chained to the pillar and scourged for impugning the supremacy of the emperor padraig and i soon exhausted our small store of memories of antioch i wished i had more to tell them i had spent but a single day there and had seen almost nothing of the city at least i was able to describe the orontes valley and the famed white walls of antioch rising up sheer from the river bank and something of the wide main street leading to the citadel as well as the citadel and palace abbot demitrianos entered while we were eating and joined us at table helping himself to bread and cheese and joining in with the brothers i liked him for his easy unassuming ways and his disregard for rank and ceremony in this he reminded me of emlyn and i found myself wishing i was long since on my way home after the meal the abbot took us to the scriptorium and introduced us to two of the senior monks who had the charge of the work of the monastery i present to you brother ambrosius the abbot said indicating a small roundshouldered monk with sparse white hairthe monk with whom i had shared a bench during prayers the night before and brother tomas our two most skilled and experienced scribes if anything can be done for you they will know the two bowed in humble deference to one another and invited us inside the room was small but airy and light a number of wide windows along the south wall allowed the sunlight to illumine the high work tables of the monks most of them were still at their morning meal so we had the scriptorium to ourselves for the moment my brothers said padraig we come to you with a problem begging your help you have heard me speak of lord duncans captivity among the muhammedans the two nodded enthusiastically as it happens he used the time of his imprisonment to make a record of his experiences unfortunately that record has been damaged padraig went on to explain about the papyri and my escape through the underground canal when he finished the abbot said i have already warned our friends that there may not be any remedy for them nevertheless i will let you decide please said brother ambrosius might we see the papuri in question it will be easier to make a determination once we have completed an examination of the documents in question added brother tomas by all means said padraig i brought out the bundle laid it on the nearest table and began to unwrap the stilldamp sheepskin brother ambrosius stopped me at once allow me he said stepping in and staying my hand let us see what we have here he bent to his work holding his head low over the skin as he carefully unpeeled the wet leather brother tomas joined him on the opposite side of the table and in a moment the two of them had exposed the tight roll of papyrus scrolls they gazed upon the soggy mass of slowly rotting matter as if at the corpse of a muchloved dog and clucked their tongues sadly there was a green tinge along the edges of the rolls and the papyrus stank with a rancid odour the two monks raised their eyes looked at one another and shook their heads i fear it is as the abbot has said ambrosius told me sadly there is nothing to be done the papuri can never be restored i am sorry even though i was already resolved to this prospect i still felt a twinge of disappointment i am certain you are right replied padraig quickly and we anticipated as much but perhaps you could tell me if i am right in thinking that these pages could be copied this request occasioned a second closer inspection and a lengthy discussion between the two master scribes they carefully pulled apart one section and carried it to the nearest window where they held it up to their faces and scrutinized it carefully it could be done tomas allowed cautiously each leaf of the papuros must be dried very slowly and flattened to prevent it from cracking to pieces then ambrosius continued it might be possible to inscribe what was written thereon although it is latin his voice took on a rueful tone the hand is fair and open the marks however faint could be traced and copied it would be a very great undertaking suggested tomas looking to his superior but it could be done truly that is good news the abbot said however i fear we will not be able to shoulder this admirable labour for you we are but a small community and the pressure of work already begun is such that we would not be able to contemplate any new endeavours however worthy for a very long time i am prepared to pay you i offered such a service requires great skill and effort i know i would be more than happy to pay whatever you deem appropriate please said demitrianos raising his hands in protest you misunderstand me i was not fishing for payment it is not your silver i am after i am telling you the truth my friend as much as i would like to help you he spread his hands but forgive me abbot said ambrosius speaking up something has just occurred to me a word he led the abbot a little apart and the two of them spoke to one another quietly for a moment i heard the abbot say very well and then he turned and smiled and said our brother has just brought a matter to my attention which i have overlooked he insists there may be a way we can help youprovided you are agreeable i assure you i am most agreeable to anythingwithin reason i allowed and the limits of my purse the work we do here is not only for ourselves but also for the wider worldfor edification and learning for posterity for succeeding generations this is why we take such great careso that those who come after us will enjoy the benefit he made a gesture towards the elderly monk who stood looking on hopefully brother ambrosius reminds me that what you have written of your sojourn in the holy land might well prove a unique and therefore valuable reflection of our perishable age he suggests that we should honour your request indeed i said pleased with the turn the thing had taken i am glad to hear it there is just one stipulation abbot demitrianos said raising a hand to check my eagerness that we should be allowed to make not one but two copies one copy for you of course said ambrosius unable to restrain his eagerness and one for our use in truth it had not occurred to me that my scribblings would be of any interest to anyone save myself and those of my family who cared about what had happened to me while there was nothing in the papyri of which i was ashamed i was not sure i wanted anyone else to read my mind and heart before i could decide however padraig nodded enthusiastically and said an excellent solution of course nothing would please us more than to know that lord duncans work might continue to serve in this way there is one other thing suggested the abbot in a slightly embarrassed tone i am reminded that the scriptorium is in need of a new roof needless to say it would greatly contribute to our work if we did not have such a burden hanging over our heads as it were i understand completely i replied i would be happy to stand the cost of a new roof for the scriptorium brothers ambrosius and tomas both clasped their hands in delight and praised the great creator for his bounteous provision we thanked the brothers for the consideration and arranged for a time to return and collect the finished copy then before the sun had quartered the sky padraig and i were on our way back to paphos we arrived the evening of the next day to learn that yordanus was gone fortyseven he went where i said disbelief making my voice harsh anger blazed up bright and hot as the sun beating down on my head though i tried my best to quench it sydoni bit her lip she knew i was displeased and was loath to withhold the truth from methough it meant betraying her fathers purpose he went to famagusta she said timidly he took wazim with him i know you said when i demanded how long has he been gone he departed the same day you left for the monastery i suppose you are right to be angry but he is only trying to help it will be no help to any of us if the templars find us here he promised not to do anything without your consent she said halfheartedly then he should not have gone at all i snapped he only went to see to his affairsnothing more she was growing defensive never fear my father will not betray your precious secret it was a foolish thing to do peace said padraig entering the courtyard just then the entire island will know of our business if you do not desist he cautioned us to leave off squabbling and went to see that the rood was still safe in its box beneath his bed as much as i might have wished otherwise yordanus was gone and there was nothing to be done about that now still i fussed and fumed and finally padraig sent me down the road to walk away my frustration i stumped along in the hot sun and felt the heat on my skin soon i was sweating and tired and though angry still i had neither the will nor the strength to maintain it any longer i stopped and looked around and found myself at one of the many ancient ruins that occupy the hilltops in that part of the island little more than an overgrown mound now with wild olive trees and bramble thickets there were still a few sunbleached sections of toppled columns to be seen an arch and part of a wallrising from the surrounding wrack like the enormous bones of a monstrous creature my anger finally subdued i sat down on the carved capital of a ruined column in the shade of a halfdead palm tree to rest and collect myself i could see the bay from where i sat and watched a few boats returning from the days fishing but there was no sign of the ship padraig and i had arrived back in paphos at midday and upon coming in view of the shallow bay i had suddenly become agitated by the time we descended the hill overlooking the harbour i knew what it was that disturbed me persephone was missing the ship was not in the harbour and nowhere to be seen we had hurried on to the house to be met by sydoni who took one look at my distraught expression and guessed what had caused my distress she explained that she had told him not to go but her father insisted he knew what he was doing and anyway he would be back before we returned in fact he did not return until two days later i spent the intervening time stalking the hills and muttering about the ruins waiting for yordanus to return i was sitting in my accustomed place in the shade when i saw a ship round the far headland and enter the bay just before sunset i watched with growing expectation until i was certain it was the persephone and then i hurried back to the house to alert sydoni and the others that yordanus had returned while sydoni and anna fluttered around preparing food and drink for her fathers return the old trader stood in the courtyard and professed his trip to have been eminently successful and that any worries i might have had were completely unfounded wazim stood with him and the two of them assured me that nothing out of the ordinary had taken place padraig and i listened to their feeble justification for their disobedience i know you instructed otherwise yordanus allowed and i did not lightly go against your wishes believe me even so he raised his hands in appeasement the day is soon coming when we must send word to commander de bracineaux at antioch i have instructed gregior to begin making the necessary preparations for that journey also he added with a touch of selfrighteous vindication i needed to replenish my purse silver does not multiply of its own accord you know and travel is a costly business there was no point in berating the man well it is over and done now i said as graciously as possible we will speak no more about it very wise agreed yordanus just then anna came into the courtyard carrying a tray laden with bowls of food and baskets of bread sydoni emerged behind her with a tray of cups and a jug of wine they placed the trays on one of the benches beneath the fig tree and the four of us sat down to eat i am anxious to learn about your trip to the monastery yordanus said were the monks able to help you they were indeed replied padraig he told about the monastery and the agreement we had made to allow the papyri to be copied they were only too happy to do it once they learned they could make a copy for themselves and a new roof for the scriptorium besides i said the words came out sounding far more caustic than i intended both padraig and yordanus looked at me curiously you seemed to find the agreement satisfactory at the time brother padraig scowls only rarely thus it speaks all the more eloquently of his displeasure you have made a fine deception of hiding your disapproval until now i beg your pardon i muttered i have misspoken forget i said anything sydoni joined us after awhile and she and padraig began discussing the hill country to the north and the many monastic settlements to be found in that part of the island yordanus meanwhile undertook a lengthy and pointless story for wazims amusementall to do with some poor farmers in the hills near paleapaphos who recently unearthed a treasure trove buried in a field they were ploughing the find apparently consisted of several gold bands and an onyx chalice which they assumed was roman but which upon examination by thebishop of paphos turned out to be greek it was thought the items had once belonged to a potentate who had owned one of the ruined palaces in the area i suppose they will be made to give up their find i remarked innocently as always everyone else has a better claim on the treasure than those who discovered it once again my tone belied my true intent the others regarded me with rank displeasure what am i not allowed an opinion after one or two more abortive attempts at joining in the conversation i finally gave up lapsing into a disgruntled and fidgety silence as the evening dragged on i found it increasingly difficult to sit still and listen to the idle prattling of the others i sipped my wine and munched salty olives all the while sinking deeper and deeper into a peculiarly fretful melancholy when at last i could no longer endure the prattling i stood so quickly i spilled my cup i grumbled an apology and excused myself saying my head hurt from too much sun and i was going to bed and that is where padraig found me some while later he had sat up talking with sydoni and yordanus and came in to find me still thrashing around unable to sleep he stood over me for a moment and even though i could not see his expression in the darkness i could tell by his prickly manner that he was disgusted with me i did my best to ignore him i know you are not asleep he said at last his voice sharp with disapproval is it any wonder if you mean to stand over me all night neither one of us shall get any rest it is not myself keeping you awake for a certainty it is your own guilty conscience his unjust accusation brought me upright guilty what have i to feel guilty about you know what you did he said your own heart condemns you i have done nothingunless treating everyone with the utmost courtesy is now become cause for reproach if i reproach you said padraig with unmerited disdain it is because you well deserve it every time yordanus opened his mouth you jumped down his throat what were you thinking the man is our host and benefactor he has helped us in a thousand ways and asks only for our friendship in return yet you treat him like the lowest filth beneath your feet what cause has yordanus to complain i replied petulantly i was not the one who went behind his back and disobeyed his orders anyway did i not forgive him why are you throwing this back in my face listen to you now disobeyed my orderswho are you to issue commands to everyone else duncan the high and mighty lifts his leg to fart and the whole world must dance to the tuneis that it you twist my words disagreeable priest i growled angrily do i he sneered do i indeed you do perhaps they were twisted to begin with and what do you mean by that think about it look you long and hard into your soul and repent of your vile and sinful conceit it does you no credit my lord he turned away leaving me to stew in my own bitter bile his rebuke stungall the more because i knew he was right though i was loath to admit it the shrewd priest had read my soul aright proud as i was i begrudged yordanus his efforts on my behalf not the least because i feared his meddling would result in my having to surrender the black rood to the templars nor was that all i resented having to depend on anyoneespecially one i deemed less reliable than myself in truth in my long captivity i had grown used to trusting no one and relying only on myself to the extent that i now resented the intrusions of others into my affairs however wellintentioned and viewed their small failings as wilful defiance of my authority these unhappy reflections kept me from my rest i lay awake long into the night staring into the darkness restless and rankled unable to sleep dawn was but a whisper away when i finally abandoned the effort i rose from my troubled bed and went out thinking to find some solace in the cool darkness of the quiet courtyard lest i disturb the sleeping household i crept as quietly as i could through the house lifted the latch and slipped out through the halfopen door closing it silently behind me i paused for a moment and looked up at the sky the moon was down and the stars were beginning to fade with the approach of daylight the air was still and fine and from some unseen corner i heard the chirrup of a cricket and something else a sliding plop followed by a rapid dry scrabble across the bare earth the sound put me in mind of a rat scurrying back to its nest but if so it was a rat the size of a donkey i stood motionless listening and when i heard the slow scrape of iron against wood i moved slowly to the corner of the house and looked towards the gate a figure dressed all in blacklittle more than a shadow in the deeper shadow of the wallstood at the gate lifting the iron bar away i started for the gate moving as swiftly and silently as i could and wishing i had some of murdos legendary stealth i crossed to the fig tree and as i stooped to crouch beneath it i caught the faint whiff of the scent i had last smelled in the tunnels beneath the hareem in cairo the unmistakable tang of hashish my mind froze fidain there was no mistake pungent and sweet with a musty metallic odour once smelled the scent is not forgotten i picked up one of the benches from beneath the tree and darted forwards the intruder heard me as i closed on him he stepped back from the gate swinging the iron bar as he turned i threw the bench before me catching the iron bar as it came around and forcing it back against his chest i drove in behind the blow slamming the bench hard against his chin the fidais jaw closed with a teethshattering clack as his head snapped back against the timber door just as his comrade on the other side started to push through the door banged shut and the arab intruder tried to squirm away i heaved the bench into his chest driving the air from his lungs he slumped to the ground his back to the door i dropped the bench and snatched up the iron bar padraig i shouted padraig help the fidai on the other side of the gate pressed hard against the door and succeeded in getting a hand and arm through the gap the hand gripped a knife that sliced at me as i tried to force the iron bar back into the carrier seeing that i could not bar the gate with the intruders arm in the way i stepped back and then hurled myself against the door the attackers arm snapped with a chunky pop like wet kindling padraig i shouted the howling fidai pulled his broken arm out of the way and i pressed the door closed with all my might i shouted for padraig again at the same instant there came a tremendous thump on the door as someone on the other side drove into it trying to force it open once more there came a rush behind me i spun around and caught the dull glint of metal streaking towards my neck i threw my hands before my face and dodged away the blow was illjudged and hurried catching me on the meaty part of the shoulder as i turned the blade went in it felt as if a red hot poker had been applied to my flesh flailing with my fists i stumbled backwards falling over the body of the unconscious intruder on the ground beside the gate and pulling the weapon from the grasp of my attacker as i went down he leapt on me straining to retrieve the blade still buried in my flesh as he bent forwards i kicked up hard into his groinonce and again he gave out a groan staggered unsteadily and collapsed onto his knees holding himself swift footsteps sounded on the earth beside me my hand closed on the handle of the knife i yanked it from my shoulder and made a wide awkward swipe to keep my new assailant off balance the man cried out duncan it is me the next thing i knew padraigs hands were on me pulling me to my feet the fidai i had kicked was struggling to rise gasping puffing his eyes streaming with tears he raised himself up on wobbly legs may god forgive me padraig said and aimed a solid kick into the softness of the halfparalysed attackers private parts the man shrieked and pitched forwards rolling in agony he gagged and then vomited over himself subsiding with a whimpering groan is that all padraig whirled around scouring the darkness for more fidain are there any more there were three of them i told him clutching my wounded arm i looked at the two on the ground both unconscious now the other is outside still i broke his arm are you hurt badly here let me see as the priest reached a hand towards my wounded shoulder there came a scream from inside the house sydoni fortyeight i flew to the house with padraig two steps ahead of me he darted through the door and across the darkened room towards the sound of sydonis muffled screams i started after him and collided with a black robed figure bent over something on the floor the invader went sprawling and my feet slid out from under me i fell landing on my wounded shoulder in a glutinous pool pain seared through me my arm throbbed with a burning ache i rolled onto my back and found myself lying next to yordanus on a floor slick with his blood the fidain attacker lurched towards me i saw his hands pale in the darkness fumbling frantically over the old mans unresisting body and realized he was searching for his knife which was hilt deep in yordanus neck we both saw the weapon at the same time and grabbed for it i was the quicker my fingers closed on the hilt and i jerked the blade free the blackrobed arab lunged again diving across yordanus i tried to roll away but his hands found my throat and squeezed hard i swung the knife backhanded with all my strength against the side of his head the blade entered his temple with but little resistance his limbs stiffened and his spine arched rigidly he gave out a startled cry and began convulsing his teeth chattering and gnashing as he writhed beside his victim on the floor the spasms grew less violent and after a moment he lay still i dragged myself onto my knees beside yordanus the old mans eyes gazed upward his mouth was open slightly as if preparing to speak but no movement stirred his chest he was gone from somewhere further back in the house i could hear voices i rose and moved quickly towards the sound and discovered it was coming from the room where sydoni and anna slept the door was closed but i could hear padraig calming reasonable and sydoni frantic pleading i put my hand to the latch and quietly as i could lifted the wooden handle and pushed the door open in the light of a single candle i saw sydoni on the far side of the room bending low over annas slumped body padraig was standing over her his arms outstretched in an attitude of protection the fidai was standing with his back to the door he glanced over his shoulder as the door opened saw me and said something in arabic then he saw the knife in my hand and turned to confront me i saw the curved blade glint in the candlelight as he swung towards me and did not wait for him to see that i was wounded now padraig i shouted charging headlong into the arab intruder he threw his arms wide to free his blade and i pulled up at the last instant as padraig stepping in swiftly behind seized the intruders knife hand in both of his the attacker swung on padraig and i dived in sliding the blade up under his ribs blood and hot damp air spewed from the wound the fidai struck me with his elbow catching me on the jaw and knocking me off balance i staggered back breaking free of padraigs grasp he leapt on me knocking me to the floor his knife blade slicing across the side of my face as i fell the curved blade rose in my assailants hand and helpless to prevent its descent i shoved my knife up into his throat the blade entered under the point of his chin passing up into his mouth he gave a strangled cry and tried to stab down at me but padraig now held his arm gagging on the blade he tried to pull it free but i held tight to the hilt blood cascaded over his teeth spilling down his chin and over my hands the wretch toppled backward choking on his tongue his fingers raked at my hands but i held firm it is enough shouted padraig duncan it is enough still i held the blade and gradually the struggling ceased only when he lay completely still did i withdraw the knife now it is enough i said slumping onto the floor sydoni terrified and shaking with fright rushed to me you are wounded she cried her trembling fingers touching my cheek your face your arm it is not so bad i told her i raised a hand for padraig to help me up i have seen five of them i said as padraig raised me to my feet we must search the house there may be more i looked at the crumpled body of the old woman i did not have to ask whether she still lived i would mourn the dead later right now it was the living who needed my attention where is wazim neither sydoni or padraig had seen him stay here and keep the door barred i instructed sydoni she glanced down at the dead arab and shook her head there was no time to argue with her so i said come along then but keep well back we proceeded through the house but did not find any more fidain upon reaching the kitchen sydoni saw her father lying on the floor with a shriek of anguish she rushed to gather his lifeless body into her arms although i wanted nothing more than to comfort her at that moment i had to make certain there were no more fidain about padraig and i continued out into the courtyard and there found wazim standing with a spear pointed at the arab i had kicked and left unconscious no longer inert he was slumped against the outer gate glaring at the little egyptian and fending off the jabbing thrusts of wazims spear well done wazim i called hurrying to join him at our appearance the arab straightened wazim glad to be relieved of this dangerous duty glanced around at us taking his eyes from his captive the spearhead wavered and dipped as he turned it was a fatal mistake the fidai darted forwards and before i could call a warning reached behind his back and whipped out a slender dagger wazim sensing the attack raised the spear catching the arab in the pit of the stomach i watched in horror as the fidai grasped the spear and held it then with a great sweeping motion of his arm drew the knife blade across wazims throat the two of them fell to the ground together one atop the other padraig rolled the dying arab aside and i knelt over wazim kadi i took his hand and he looked up at me and smiled he moved his mouth but he could not speak i am sorry my friend i told him go with god he gave out a little sigh and his life passed from him padraig and i knelt beside his body for a time like the good cele de he was padraig stretched his hands over the body one palm at the forehead one at the heart he spoke a rune for the dead and then prayed our friend on his way the sleep of seven joys be thine dear friend with waking to the peace of paradise with glad waking to eternal peace in paradise we hurried on with our search scouring every last corner of the house yard and outbuildings until we were satisfied that there were no more intruders to be found padraig put his hand on my shoulder it is over no i told him there is one more taking up wazims spear which padraig had removed from the dead arab i crossed the courtyard and opened the gate to find the last of the fidain crouching beside the wall he was rocking slowly back and forth cradling his crushed arm across his body he turned his head and looked at us as we stepped out onto the road his eyes were halflidded and his movements sluggish as he made to stand padraig holding out his empty hands slowly advanced towards the injured fidai peace he said salaam the arab fumbled at his belt with his good hand and brought out a knife holding it at arms length he uttered a low growl of warning his speech slurred and muttering it must be the hashish i told padraig stepping quickly beside him the killing will stop said padraig extending his hand once more give me your weapon at that moment a cock crowed in the yard of a house down the road away in the east night was beginning to fade the arab made a clumsy swing with the knife to keep us back and then leaned against the wall his face to the rising sun give me the knife said padraig extending his hand the fidai looked at us his dark eyes glazed with drugged hatred he drew a deep breath put his head back la ilaha ilia allah he shouted and then turned the knife on himself plunging it into his own heart he slumped backward to the ground and rolled onto his side a tremor passed through his body and he gave out a groan which ended in a death rattle and then it was finished after a moment i bent down and removed the knife great of heaven i pray that was the last of them padraig said quietly amen how did they know where to find us do you wonder i asked i saw it so clearly in hindsight i could only marvel at my blindness to now they must have been watching yordanus house in famagusta when he returned to paphos they followed him here but who could have sent them to fam the priest began and then halted de bracineaux padraig turned to me his face illumined by days first light you knew this would happen no i replied shaking my head sadly i feared it only now that they know where to find us padraig surmised there is nothing to stop them sending more fidain the templars will not rest until they have achieved their aims we cannot stay here i said suddenly exhausted i passed a hand over my face my arm was throbbing and i could feel the beat of pain in my head and all down my side the cock crowed again and then everything grew strangely quiet i swayed on my feet and my vision blurred i looked at padraig and i saw his mouth move but could no longer hear him speaking to me i remember very little after that only darkness and a sense of tranquil motion and then nothing fortynine dearest caitriona my life my light my hope if not for the poisoned blades of the wicked hashishin i should have been home long since as it is i have been forced to endure another captivitythis time in a bare little cell within the walls of ayios moni abbot demitrianos will forgive me for saying that while my clean bare cell may be poorer by far than the sumptuous chamber i had within the caliphs palace this new confinement is eminently superior in every way i have had nothing but the best of care since my arrival these many months ago indeed i do not hesitate to say it if not for the healing skills of the monks here i heartily doubt whether i would be drawing breath much less lifting pen to write to you now my soul although i chafe at captivity once more i endure with a high and hopeful heart and thus resume the work which has occupied me during my long sojourn hi outremer kindly brother tomas visits me daily bringing the list of difficulties his diligent scribes have encountered in their patient work of copying my poor scraps of ruined papyri onto fine clean parchments sometimes it is a word they cannot read owing to the deterioration of the brittle and delicate papyrus just as often it is likely to be my hamfisted script that has brought them to distraction thus we sit together the gentle brother and i he asks me to supply the meaning which has perplexed them and i embellish the tale with remembrances refined by hindsight my indulgent taskmaster does not like it when i try to improve upon what i have written he insists that it must be rendered as first i set it down this he tells me assures a purity of authenticitysomething the fastidious brothers seem overly keen to preserve it seems to me but then i am no scholar nor ever likely to be still i cannot help myself the memories come thick and fast so vivid and clear the more i tell the more i remember my patient scribes take it all down without complaining and like busy weavers make a whole cloth of ragged patches so my tale grows in the making expanding beneath the good brothers diligent hands abbot demitrianos comes to see me every day also he tells me that for the first few weeks i was as he puts it not of this world nor was i of the next world either i confess for i remember nothing save recurrent periods of light and darkdays perhaps except they spun like the alternating spokes of a fast turning wheeland this along with the soft and distant murmur of comforting voices often with the scent of fragrant smoke they say i hovered between life and death and the times i smelled the smoke was when i drifted close to the heavenly altar and partook of the incense of paradise as to that i cannot say i am the wiser for it any glories that might have been glimpsed through the veil were certainly lost on me the allobscuring shroud remained in place secure from my prying eyes thus the secrets of the hereafter are safe for another season later when i awoke from my long sleep the first thing i saw once the daylight had ceased causing my eyes to waterwas sydonis lovely face as she bathed my brow with a cooling cloth for she too has been a constant visitor rarely absent from my side for more than a few brief moments when she takes her own muchneeded rest the greek monks do not usually allow women to remain behind their protecting walls beyond sunset but the wise abbot offered a special dispensation for sydoni in view of the circumstances however it was as much a necessity as a blessingalthough i imagine they would have had a fight on their hands had they tried to send her away she has been a perpetual source of strength and comfort to me and i have needed bothespecially in those first days after waking when too weak to lift my head from my pallet she fed me and nursed me i do believe sydoni pulled me back from deaths dark and silent gate by the sheer force of her unflagging resolve padraig too has been a very championa hero the great celts of old would not hesitate to welcome into their exalted companionship padraig has been the rock of salvation for me my souls true friend my anam cara in word and unfailing deed it is to padraigs quick thinking that i owe my continued existence in the land of the living for following my collapse in the road the canny priest swiftly discerned that the severity of my wounds could not alone account for my sudden decline he summoned sydoni who confirmed that the fidain most often poison the blades of their knives so that should they fail to strike a killing blow even the smallest cut will eventually prove fatal he wasted not an instant but bundled me in a robe and put me along with the box containing the holy roodin a borrowed wagon and carried me with all speed to ayios moni if it was the monks who healed me with their shrewd knowledge it was padraig who gave them the chance poor sydoni faced the cruel dilemma of accompanying me to the monastery or staying behind and seeing to her fathers burial not that she had time to linger over the choice padraig needed help to get me to the monastery and could not allow her to remain in any event he foresaw the likelihood that another attack would be forthcoming as soon as those who instigated the first began to suspect it had failed nor did his watchcare end there far from it no sooner had he delivered me into the capable hands of the greek brothers than he hastened back to paphos to move the ship he sailed to famagusta and with the ships pilot and crew and gregior and omers help loaded the persephone with as much of yordanus treasure as he could without raising local suspicion he then hid the ship in a tiny cove on the northwestern side of the islanda little fishing village called latchi near the ancient roman city of polisthus safeguarding our surest and best chance of making good our escape when the time comes to do so having seen to these arrangements he returned to the monastery to help relieve sydoni in her long and selfless vigil at my bedside they took it in turn to pray over me and anoint my insensate body with holy oil and medicinal balms which they rubbed into my halfdead flesh along with the greek brothers they worked the slow miracle of my recovery two seasons passed while i hovered between this life and the next i awoke one fine spring day with brilliant white light streaming in through the open window of my cell i use the word awoke for i know no other way to describe it yet the sensation was unlike any awakening i have ever known i opened my eyes and looked around and it was as if i had come into the world as a newborn infant possessing neither memory nor knowledge of anything that had gone before i raised a hand to shield my eyes heard a gasp and turned my head towards the sound i looked at the face of the woman clutching my hand and understood only that she was dear to mei knew not how neither did i know her name or anything about her i loved her for the kindness in her face and the joyful tears in her eyes and then i slept again this time it was a genuine sleep deep and restful when i opened my eyes on the next morning sydoni was there beside me praying for my healing the moment i beheld her graceful head bent over her folded hands her arms resting on the edge of my bed i knew i would live and not die each day thereafter i enjoyed some small improvement drinking my broth unaided eating my first solid food sitting upright and the like although it would be a long time yet before i could walk unaided under my own strength that day was the beginning of my recovery though sydoni and padraig spent the greater portion of every day with me i nevertheless had a great deal of time to think as i grew stronger and could sustain the effort i considered what had happened at first my memories were vague shadowy and unreal through a glass darkly as padraig would say but as i put my mind to it more came clear and still more until i could at last recall the events of that terrible night alas it would have been better to allow the memory to sleep undisturbed the horror of that painful night will haunt me for a long time i fear i lost good friends and cannot help feeling that my own stubborn will is to blame padraig tells me this is foolishness that i was not the one who sent the fidain to kill and recover the relic that was commander de bracineauxs decision alone and i believe in my bones that he is right yet as i have passed the days in contemplation i cannot swear before the judgement throne that this is so as much as i believe the templar commander bears the responsibility i have no real proof of his guiltonly hardened suspicion true de bracineaux was the only person who knew where we could be found did he desire the holy relic so fervently he would kill for it it must be remembered that it was renaud who sent me to yordanus to begin with i ask myself could he so easily betray his friends to death perhaps he did not mean for anyone to be killed but if that is the case then why send the fidain why not come himself and demand the return of the relic then again it may be that he did not send them perhaps they came on their own accord hoping to recover the holy relic and thereby win favour with the templars for obscure reasons of their own maybe that is the way of it again i cannot say and i think no one will ever know thus although i do believe renaud de bracineaux was the author and agent of the bloody butchery of that awful night the fact remains that i can offer no decisive proof one way or the other i do know however that i am fully to blame for my part in it if i had walked emptyhanded from the caliphs palace yordanus wazim and anna would still be alive today i grieve for them and i lament their cruel deaths before i leave this island i will stand beside their graves and beg their forgiveness as i have done a thousand times already in my heart padraig says that each of lifes experiences has great volumes to teach any ardent enough to seek the learning so i ask myself what i will take from this strange pilgrimage of mine try as i might to reclaim something golden from the dross of this misbegotten enterprise i cannot help hearing nurmal of mamistras voice saying the enemy you meet today might be the friend you call upon tomorrow i think of this and i remember emlyn telling me how the crusaders of the great pilgrimage inflamed by blood lust and ignorant greed slaughtered greek and jew armenian copt and arab alike recognizing no distinctions lest any foe escape on my pilgrimage however it has been the enemies of those first crusaders who have befriended me while the friends i thought to trust were worse to me than enemies foresworn this has been a bitter lesson i know now how my father feels and why i know why he set his face so adamantly against crusading and against my going i pray i may yet receive his forgiveness for my wilful disobedience padraig wise priest that he is tells me i have no need to ask that which has been granted a thousand times already he says the teaching of the cele de is that each man must follow the light he is given and that pilgrims on the true path can never stray so long as they follow the holy light i hope i have done that god knows i have tried and now dear cait my thoughts and prayers are turning ever and again towards home i long for the day when i can see you and hold you and take you upon my knee and tell you how very much i have missed seeing your bright eyes and winsome smile one day soon it cannot be soon enough dear heartwhen the winterstirred seas have grown calm and the winds fair padraig and i will raise sail and steer a homeward course rest assured there is a good fast ship awaiting us and once we loose the moorings there will be no more stopping no more adventures until we reach the caithness coast in my heart i am already on that homebound ship indeed i can almost feel the fresh northern wind on my face and hear the ropes sing as fair persephone bounds over the waves carrying us around the broad headland and into the bay below banvard what will i bring with me many extraordinary memories a few scars a little wisdom i will bring the parchments the good brothers have so faithfully and carefully prepared i will bring the black rood of course and that would be prize enough even so i will bring with me another treasure sydoni herself to be your mother and my wife dearest cait i know you will love her as much as i do i pray the swift sure hand smooths the way before us for i cannot wait to see the two of you together under the same roof when i have my family around me once more i promise never again to let the wild redheathered hills of scotland out of my sight that is a vow i shall gladly keep epilogue november paphos cyprus paphos glistens in the warm autumn light the whitewashed houses of the fishermen shimmer as i gaze out upon a bay of hammered silver the late afternoon air is soft and scented with lemon blossom and i have been drowsing over my work far longer than i intended here in this ancient fishing village bathed by the sun and soft mediterranean air everyday life in rainlashed scotland seems very far away indeed as caitlin and i amble along the winding streets of this charming quiet town it is difficult to imagine the bonechilling north sea gales roaring through edinburgh as winter prepares to wring the final ounce of forbearance from the tough scottish soul before grudgingly relinquishing its allotted span to a grim and dismal spring i exaggerate neither whit nor whisker when i say i have spent the most thoroughly luxurious and enjoyable holiday of my entire life although we have been here but a few weeks i feel as if i know the timeless rhythms of village life like a native in short i am enamoured of this little island and its oldfashioned homely charms it may be dotty romanticismthe affliction of the scotsman abroad but i believe the local people have taken us to heart at least we have been here long enough for the cypriots to begin to accept us as something more than the novelty we obviously are the little ladiesfishwives and widows for the most part dressed in black from head to foot elaborate black shawls around their shouldersnow greet us enthusiastically when they see us on our morning expeditions to the market and the shopkeepers and stallholders make much over caitlin everyone wants to touch her they pat her hands and stroke her hair and treat her as if she were a goddess dropped into their midst aphrodite reborn as a presbyterian with the smile of an angel and a voice that purrs in a rich scottish brogue so enchanted with cyprus are we that i find myself hankering after a little cottage in kato paphos where gait and i can potter around when my days of legal beavering are over in the scant few weeks since our arrival i feel myself positively reborn i suppose the years of dull lawyering have taken their toll without my noticing i had gradually sunk into the deadening routines of the dutiful drudge going about my mundane affairs life had dwindled down to a comfortable not to say monotonous sameness that is as deadly to the soul as any sin i know now why i was sent to this havenand why it was necessary for caitlin to accompany me over the past few weeks i have been on a questa pilgrimage if you likewhich has transformed me utterly i now know who i am and more importantly my ancestry and pedigree i now know that my election to the seven was no accident of chance i belong to an ancient and noble lineage in these last blessed days of light and warmth before the darkness and cold of battle descends i have been given an inestimable gift to carry me through the bitter times ahead in these last days i have recaptured something of the intoxicating recklessness and abandon that i experienced when i last put pen to paper in that whitehot blaze of incendiary vision at the time i truly felt that i was losing my mind that if i left off writing even for a moment the tenuous thread of sanity would slip from my sweaty grasp and i would plunge headlong into the bottomless pit of dementia there to live out my days perpetually seeking the thing i had lost but never remembering what it was or why it should matter so such was the fever that drove me i have of course read that muchblotted missivenot once only but several times and am convinced in my own mind at least that i have made a credible job of setting forth the truth of what was communicated to me that night in the crypt i mention this now because if i imagined that my own pilgrimage had reached its conclusion that notion was shattered forever at ayios moni day after day as i poured over the ancient manuscript teasing out the meaning of that longdead language the fire slowly rekindled and upon turning over the last leaf the transformation begun when i touched that bundle of mouldering parchment was complete i see now that the lineage is long and the quest begun all those ages ago continues where it will end i cannot say but i know i am in good company like duncan i am learning that however dark and uncertain the path we never travel alone there are angels along the way waiting to help and befriend us brave stalwart duncan seems to me in many ways closer than a brother almost an entire millennium stands between his day and mine and yet i can hear his voice speaking to me across the years as if he were hovering at my shoulder however mistaken i may be i feel as if i know him as i have known few others moreover i am reconfirmed in the realization that not only are the past and present woven of the same thread the past is neither dead nor distant it continues to exert a genuine and potent force on both present and future on all that is and is to come in these last days i have come to believe that we are none of us so estranged from our ancestral heritage that we no longer feel its ageold rhythm in the pulse and flow of the blood through our veins the lives of previous generations can be traced in the lines of our hands and the meditations of our hearts for we are not ourselves alone we are all that has gone before
