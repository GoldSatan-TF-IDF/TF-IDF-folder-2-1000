john grisham the street lawyer one the man with the rubber boots stepped into the elevator behind me but i didnt see him at first i smelled him thoughthe pungent odor of smoke and cheap wine and life on the street without soap we were alone as we moved upward and when i finally glanced over i saw the boots black and dirty and much too large a frayed and tattered trench coat fell to his knees under it layers of foul clothing bunched around his midsection so that he appeared stocky almost fat but it wasnt from being well fed in the wintertime in dc the street people wear everything they own or so it seems he was black and aginghis beard and hair were halfgray and hadnt been washed or cut in years he looked straight ahead through thick sunglasses thoroughly ignoring me and making me wonder for a second why exacdy i was inspecting him he didnt belong it was not his building not his elevator not a place he could afford the lawyers on all eight floors worked for my firm at hourly rates that still seemed obscene to me even after seven years just another street bum in from the cold happened all the time in downtown washington but we had security guards to deal with the riffraff we stopped at six and i noticed for the first time that he had not pushed a button had not selected a floor he was following me i made a quick exit and as i stepped into the splendid marble foyer of drake and sweeney i glanced over my shoulder just long enough to see him standing in the elevator looking at nothing still ignoring me madam devier one of our very resilient receptionists greeted me with her typical look of disdain watch the elevator i said why street bum you may want to call security those people she said in her affected french accent get some disinfectant too i walked away wrestling my overcoat off my shoulders forgetting the man with the rubber boots i had nonstop meetings throughout the afternoon important conferences with important people i turned the corner and was about to say something to polly my secretary when i heard the first shot madam devier was standing behind her desk petrifled staring into the barrel of an awfully long handgun held by our pal the street bum since i was the first one to come to her aid he politely aimed it at me and i too became rigid dont shoot i said hands in the air id seen enough movies to know precisely what to do shut up he mumbled with a great deal of composure there were voices in the hallway behind me someone yelled hes got a gun and then the voices disappeared into the background growing fainter and fainter as my colleagues hit the back door i could almost see them jumping out the windows to my immediate left was a heavy wooden door that led to a large conference room which at that moment happened to be filled with eight lawyers from our litigation section eight hardnosed and fearless litigators who spent their hours chewing up people the toughest was a scrappy little torpedo named rafter and as he yanked open the door saying what the hell the barrel swung from me to him and the man with the rubber boots had exactly what he wanted put that gun down rafter ordered from the doorway and a split second later another shot rang through the reception area a shot that went into the ceiling somewhere well above rafters head and reduced him to a mere mortal turning the gun back to me he nodded and i complied entering the conference room behind rafter the last thing i saw on the outside was madam devier shaking at her desk terrorstricken headset around her neck high heels parked neatly next to her wastebasket the man with the rubber boots slammed the door behind me and slowly waved the gun through the air so that all eight litigators could admire it it seemed to be working fine the smell of its discharge was more noticeable than the odor of its owner the room was dominated by a long table covered with documents and papers that only seconds ago seenled terribly important a row of windows overlooked a parking lot two doors led to the hallway up against the wall he said using the gun as a very effective prop then he placed it very near my head and said lock the doors which i did not a word from the eight litigators as they scrambled backward not a word from me as i quickly locked the doors then looked at him for approval for some reason i kept thinking of the post office and all those horrible shootingsa disgruntled employee returns after lunch with an arsenal and wipes out fifteen of his coworkers i thought of the playground massacresand the slaughters at fastfood restaurants and those victims were innocent children and otherwise decent citizens we were a bunch of lawyers using a series of grunts and gun thrusts he lined the eight litigators up against the wall and when their positions suited him he turned his attention to me what did he want could he ask questions if so he could get anything he damned well pleased i couldnt see his eyes because of the sunglasses but he could see mine the gun was pointed at them he removed his filthy trench coat folded it as if it were new and placed it in the center of the table the smell that had bothered me in the elevator was back but not important now he stood at the end of the table and slowly removed the next layera bulky gray cardigan bulky for a reason under it strapped to his waist was a row of red sticks which appeared to my untrained eye to be dynamite wires ran like colored spaghetti from the tops and bottoms of the sticks and silver duct tape kept things attached my first instinct was to bolt to lunge with arms and legs flapping and flailing for the door and hope for luck hope for a bad shot as i scrambled for the lock then another bad shot as i fell through the doorway into the hallway but my knees shook and my blood ran cold there were gasps and slight moans from the eight against the wall and this perturbed our captor please be quiet he said in the tone of a patient professor his calmness unnerved me he adjusted some of the spaghetti around his waist then from a pocket in his large trousers produced a neat bundle of yellow nylon rope and a switchblade for good measure he waved the gun at the horrified faces in front of him and said i dont want to hurt anybody that was nice to hear but hard to take seriously i counted twelve red sticksenough i was certain to make it instantaneous and painless then the gun was back on me you he said tie them up rafter had had enough he took one very small step forward and said look pal just exactly what do you want the third shot sailed over his head into the ceiling where it lodged harmlessly it sounded like a cannon and madam devier or some female shrieked in the foyer rafter ducked and as he attempted to stand upright the beefy elbow of umstead caught him squarely in the chest and returned him to his position against the wall shut up umstead said with clenched jaws do not call me pal the man said and pal was instantly discarded as a reference what would you like us to call you i asked sensing that i was about to become the leader of the hostages i said this very delicately with great deference and he appreciated my respect mister he said mister was perfectly fine with everyone in the room the phone rang and i thought for a split second he was going to shoot it instead he waved it over and i placed it squarely before him on the table he lifted the receiver with his left hand his right still held the gun and the gun was still pointed at rafter if the nine of us had a vote rafter would be the first sacrificial lamb eight to one hello mister said he listened briefly then hung up he carefully backed himself into the seat at the end of the table and sat down take the rope he said to me he wanted all eight of them attached at the wrists i cut rope and tied knots and tried my best not to look at the faces of my colleagues as i hastened their deaths i could feel the gun at my back he wanted them bound tightly and i made a show of practically drawing blood while leaving as much slack as possible rafter mumbled something under his breath and i wanted to slap him umstead was able to flex his wrists so that the ropes almost fell loose when i finished with him malamud was sweating and breathing rapidly he was the oldest the only parmer and two years past his first heart attack i couldnt help but look at barry nuzzo my one friend in the bunch we were the same age thirtytwo and had joined the firm the same year he went to princeton i went to yale both of our wives were from providence his marriage was workingthree kids in four years mine was in the final stage of a long deterioration our eyes met and we both were thinking about his kids i felt lucky to be childless the first of many sirens came into range and mister instructed me to close the blinds over the five large windows i went about this methodically scanning the parking lot below as if being seen might somehow save me a lone police car sat empty with its lights on the cops were already in the building and there we were nine white boys and mister at last count drake and sweeney had eight hundred lawyers in offices around the world half of them were in dc in the building mister was terrorizing he instructed me to call the boss and inform him that he was armed and wired with twelve sticks of dynamite i called rudolph managing parmer of my division antitrust and relayed the message you okay mike he asked me we were on misters new speakerphone at full volme wonderful i said please do whatever he wants what does he want i dont know yet mister waved the gun and the conversation was over taking my cue from the pistol i assumed a standing position next to the conference table a few feet from mister who had developed the irritating habit of playing absentmindedly with the wires coiled against his chest he glanced down and gave a slight tug at a red wire this red one here i give it a yank and its all over the sunglasses were looking at me when he finished this litfie warning i felt compelled to say something why would you do that i asked desperate to open a dialogue i dont want to but why not i was struck by his dictiona slow methodical rhythm with no hurry and each syllable getting equal treatment he was a street bum at the moment but there had been better days why would you want to kill us i asked im not going to argue with you he announced no further questions your honor because im a lawyer and live by the clock i checked my watch so that whatever happened could be duly recorded if we somehow managed to survive it was onetwenty mister wanted things quiet and so we endured a nerveracking period of silence that lasted fourteen minutes i could not believe that we were going to die there appeared to be no motive no reason to kill us i was certain that none of us had ever met him before i remembered the ride on the elevator and the fact that he seemed to have no particular destination he was just a nut in search of hostages which unfortunately would have made the killings seem almost normal by todays standards it was precisely the kind of senseless slaughter that would grab the headlines for twentyfour hours and make people shake their heads then the dead lawyer jokes would start i could see the headlines and hear the reporters but i refused to believe it would happen i heard voices in the foyer sirens outside a police radio squawked somewhere down the hallway what did you eat for lunch mister asked me his voice breaking the silence too surprised to consider lying i hesitated for a second then said a grilled chicken caesar alone no i met a friend he was a law school buddy from philly how much did it cost for both of you thirty bucks he didnt like this thirty bucks he repeated for two people he shook his head then looked at the eight litigators if he polled them i hoped they planned to lie there were some serious stomachs among the group and thirty bucks wouldnt cover their appetizers you know what i had he asked me no i had soup soup and crackers at a shelter free soup and i was glad to get it you could feed a hundred of my friends for thirty bucks you know that i nodded gravely as if i suddenly realized the weight of my sin collect all the wallets money watches jewelry he said waving the gun again may i ask why i asked no i placed my wallet watch and cash on the table and began rummaging through the pockets of my fellow hostages its for the next of kin mister said and we all exhaled he instructed me to place the loot in a briefcase lock it and call the boss again rudolph answered on the first ring i could envision the swat leader camped in his office rudolph its me mike again im on the speakerphone yes mike are you okay just fine look this gentleman wants me to open the door nearest the reception area and place a black briefcase in the hallway i will then close the door and lock it understand yes with the gun touching the back of my head i slowly cracked the door and tossed the briefcase into the hallway i did not see a person anywhere few things can keep a bigfirm lawyer from the joys of hourly billing sleep is one though most of us slept little eating actually encouraged billing especially lunch when the client was picking up the check as the minutes dragged on i caught myself wondering how in the world the other four hundred lawyers in the building would manage to bill while waiting for the hostage crisis to end i could just see them out there in the parking lot most of them sitting in their cars to keep warm chatting away on cell phones billing somebody the firm i decided wouldnt miss a beat some of the cutthroats clown there didnt care how it ended just hurry up and get it over with mister seemed to doze for a second his chin dipped and his breathing was heavier rafter grunted to get my attention then jerked his head to one side as if to suggest i make a move problem was mister held the gun with his right hand and if he was indeed napping then he was doing so with the dreaded red wire held firmly in his left hand and rafter wanted me to be the hero though rafter was the meanest and most effective litigator in the firm he was not yet a parmer he was not in my division and we werent in the army i didnt take orders how much money did you make last year mister very much awake asked me his voice clear again i was startled i uh gosh let me see dont lie a hundred and twenty thousand he didnt like this either how much did you give away give away yes to charities oh well i really dont remember my wife takes care of the bills and things like that all eight litigators seemed to shift at once mister didnt like my answer and he was not about to be denied who like fills in your tax forms you mean for the irs yeah thats it its handled by our tax division down on the second floor here in this building yes then get it for me get me the tax records for everybody here i looked at their faces and a couple wanted to say just go ahead and shoot me i mustve hesitated too long because mister shouted do it now and he used the gun when he shouted i called rudolph who also hesitated and so i shouted at him just fax them in here i demanded last years only we stared at the fax machine in the corner for fifteen minutes afraid mister might start executing us if our s didnt hurry along two freshly appointed as scribe for the group i sat where mister pointed with the gun and clutched the faxes my buddies had been standing for almost two hours backs to the wall still joined together barely able to move and they were beginning to slouch and slump and look miserable but their level of discomfort was about to rise significantly you first he said to me whats your name michael brock i answered politely nice to meet you how much money did you make last year ive already told you a hundred and twenty thousand before taxes how much did you give away was certain i could lie i was not a tax lawyer but i was confident i could dance around his questions i found my and took my time flipping through the pages claire had earned thirtyone thousand dollars as a secondyear surgical resident so our gross income looked quite handsome but we paid fiftythree thousand in taxesfederal income and an amazing variety of othersand after repayment of student loans claires educational expenses twentyfour hundred a month for a very nice apartment in georgetown two latemodel cars with the obligatory mortgages and a host of other costs naturally related to a comfortable lifestyle we had invested only twentytwo thousand in mutual funds mister was waiting patiently in fact his patience was beginning to unnerve me i assumed that the swat boys were crawling in the air vents climbing nearby trees scampering across the roofs of buildings next door looking at blueprints of our offices doing all the things you see on tv with the goal of somehow placing a bullet through his skull and he seemed oblivious to it he had accepted his fate and was ready to die not true for the rest of us he continually toyed with the red wire and that kept my heart rate over a hundred i gave a thousand dollars to yale i said and two thousand to the local united way how much did you give to poor people i doubted if the yale money went to feed needy students well the united way spreads the money around the city and im sure some of it went to help the poor how much did you give to the hungry i paid fiftythree thousand dollars in taxes and a nice chunk of it went for welfare medicaid aid to dependent children stuff like that and you did this voluntarily with a giving spirit i didnt complain i said lying like most of my countrymen have you ever been hungry he liked simple answers and my wit and sarcasm would not be productive no i said i have not have you ever slept in the snow no you make a lot of money yet youre too greedy to hand me some change on the sidewalk he waved the gun at the rest of them all of you you walk right by me as i sit and beg you spend more on fancy coffee than i do on meals why cant you help the poor the sick the homeless you have so much i caught myself looking at those greedy bastards along with mister and it was not a pretty sight most were staring at their feet only rafter glared down the table thinking the thoughts all of us had when we stepped over the misters of dc if i give you some change youll run to the liquor store only beg more never leave the sidewalk silence again a helicopter hovered nearby and i could only imagine what they were planning in the parking lot pursuant to misters instructions the phone lines were on hold so there was no communication he had no desire to talk to or negotiate with anyone he had his audience in the conference room which of these guys makes the most money he asked me malamud was the only partner and i shuffled the papers until i found his that would be me malamud offered what is your name nate malamud i flipped through nates return it was a rare moment to see the intimate details of a partners success but i got no pleasure from it how much mister asked me oh the joys of the irs code what would you like sir gross adjusted gross net taxable income from salaries and wages or income from business and investments malamuds salary from the firm was fifty thousand dollars a month and his annual bonus the one we all dreamed about was five hundred and ten thousand it had been a very good year and we all knew it he was one of many partners who had earned over a million dollars i decided to play it safe there was lots of other income tucked away near the back of the returnrental properties dividends a small businessbut i guessed that if mister somehow grabbed the return he would struggle with the numbers one point one million i said leaving another two hundred thousand on the table tie contemplated this for a moment you made a million dollars he said to malamud who wasnt the least bit ashamed of it yes i did how much did you give to the hungry and the homeless i was already scouring his itemized deductions for the truth i dont recall exactly my wife and i give to a lot of charities i know there was a donation i think for five thousand to the greater dc fund which as im sure you know distributes money to the needy we give a lot and were happy to do it im sure youre very happy mister replied with the first hint of sarcasm he wasnt about to allow us to explain how generous we really were he simply wanted the hard facts he instructed me to list all nine names and beside each write last years income then last years gifts to charities it took some time and i didnt know whether to hurry or be deliberate would he slaughter us if he didnt like the math perhaps i shouldnt hurry it was immediately obvious that we rich folks had made lots of money while handing over precious little of it at the same time i knew the longer the situation dragged on the crazier the rescue scenarios would become he hadnt mentioned executing a hostage every hour he didnt want his buddies freed from jail he didnt seem to want anything really i took my time malamud set the pace the rear was brought up by colburn a thirdyear associate who grossed a mere eightysix thousand i was dismayed to learn my pal barry nuzzo earned eleven thousand more than i did we would discuss it later if you round it off it comes to three million dollars i reported to mister who appeared to be napping again with his fingers still on the red wire he slowly shook his head and how much for the poor people total contributions of one hundred eighty thousand i dont want total contributions dont put me and my people in the same class with the symphony and the synagogue and all your pretty white folks clubs where you auction wine and autographs and give a few bucks to the boy scouts im talking about food food for hungry people who live here in the same city you live in food for little babies right here right in this city with all you people making millions we got little babies starving at night crying cause theyre hungry how much for food he was looking at me i was looking at the papers in front of me i couldnt lie he continued we got soup kitchens all over town places where the poor and homeless can get something to eat how much money did you folks give to the soup kitchens any not directly i said but some of these charities shut up he waved the damned gun again how about homeless shelters places we sleep when its ten degrees outside how many shelters are listed there in those papers invention failed me none i said softly he jumped to his feet startling us the red sticks fully visible under the silver duct tape he kicked his chair back how bout clinics we got these little clinics where doctorsgood decent people who used to make lots of moneycome and donate their time to help the sick they dont charge nothing government used to help pay the rent help buy the medicine and supplies now the govemments run by newt and all the moneys gone how much do you give to the clinics rafter looked at me as if i should do something perhaps suddenly see something in the papers and say damn look here we gave half a million bucks to the clinics and soup kitchens thats exactly what rafter would do but not me i didnt want to get shot mister was a lot smarter than he looked i flipped through the papers as mister walked to the windows and peeked around the miniblinds cops everywhere he said just loud enough for us to hear and lots of ambulances he then forgot about the scene below and shuffled along the edge of the table until he stopped near his hostages they watched every move with particular attention paid to the explosives he slowly raised the gun and aimed it directly at colburns nose less than three feet away how much did you give to the clinics none colburn said closing his eyes tightly ready to cry my heart froze and i held my breath how much to the soup kitchens none how much to the homeless shelters none instead of shooting colburn he aimed at nuzzo and repeated the three questions nnzzo had identical responses and mister moved down the line pointing asking the same questions getting the same answers he didnt shoot rafter much to our dismay three million dollars he said in disgust and not a dime for the sick and hungry you are miserable people we felt miserable and i realized he was not going to kill us how could an average street bum acquire dynamite and who would teach him how to wire it at dusk he said he was hungry and he told me to call the boss and order soup from the methodist mission at l street and seventeenth northwest they put more vegetables in the broth mister said and the bread was not as stale as in most kitchens the soup kitchen does carryout rudolph asked his voice incredulous it echoed around the room from the speakerphone just do it rudolph i barked back at him and get enough for ten people mister told me to hang up and again put the lines on hold i could see our friends and a squadron of cops flying across the city through rashhour traffic and descending upon the quiet little mission where the ragged street people hunched over their bowls of broth and wondered what the hell was going on ten orders to go extra bread mister made another trip to the window when we heard the helicopter again he peeked out stepped back tugged at his beard and pondered the situation what type of invasion could they possibly be planning that would involve a helicopter maybe it was to evacuate the wounded umstead had been fidgeting for an hour much to the dismay of rafter and malamud who were joined to him at the wrists he finally couldnt stand it any longer uh sir excuse me but i really have to uh go to the boys room mister kept ragging boys room whats a boys room i need to pee sir urnstead said very much like a thirdgrader i cant hold it any longer mister looked around the room and noticed a porcelain vase sitting innocently on a coffee table with another wave of the gun he ordered me to untie umstead the boys room is over there mister said umstead removed the fresh flowers from the vase and with his back to us urinated for a long time while we studied the floor when he finally finished mister told us to move the conference table next to the windows it was twenty feet long solid walnut like most of the furniture at drake and sweeney and with me on one end and umstead grunting on the other we managed to inch it over about six feet until mister said stop he made me latch malamud and rafter together leaving umstead a free man i would never understand why he did this next he forced the remaining seven bound hostages to sit on the table with their backs to the wall no one dared ask why but i figured he wanted a shield from sharpshooters i later learned that the police had snipers perched on a building next door perhaps mister had seen them after standing for five hours rafter and company were relieved to be off their feet umstead and i were told to sit in chairs and mister took a seat at the end of the table we waited life in the streets must teach one patience he seemed content to sit in silence for long periods of time his eyes hiding behind the glasses his head perfectly still who are the evictors he mumbled to no one in particular and he waited a couple of minutes before saying it again we looked at each other confused with no clue what he was talking about he appeared to be staring at a spot on the table not far from colburns right foot not only do you ignore the homeless you help put them in the streets we of course nodded along all singing from the same sheet if he wanted to heap verbal abuse on us we were perfectly willing to accept it our carryout arrived at a few minutes before seven there was a sharp knock on the door mister told me to place a call and warn the police that he would kill one of us if he saw or heard anyone outside i explained this carefully to rudolph and i stressed that no rescue should be attempted we were negotiating rudolph said he understood umstead walked to the door unlocked it and looked at mister for instructions mister was behind him with the gun less than a foot from umsteads head open the door very slowly mister said i was standing a few feet behind mister when the door opened the food was on a small cart one of our paralegals used to haul around the enormous amounts of paper we generated i could see four large plastic containers of soup and a brown paper bag filled with bread i dont know if there was anything to drink we never found out urnstead took one step into the hallway grabbed the cart and was about to pull it back into the conference room when the shot cracked through the air a lone police sniper was hiding behind a credenza next to madam deviers desk forty feet away and he got the clear look he needed when umstead bent over to grab the cart misters head was exposed for a split second and the sniper blew it off mister lurched backward without uttering a sound and my face was instantly covered with blood and fluids i thought id been hit too and i remember screaming in pain umstead was yelling somewhere in the hall the other seven scrambled off the table like scalded dogs all yelling and digging toward the door half of them dragging the other half i was on my knees clutching my eyes waiting for the dynamite to explode then i bolted for the other door away from the mayhem i unlocked it yanked it open and the last time i saw mister he was twitching on one of our expensive oriental rugs his hands were loose at his sides nowhere near the red wire the hallway was suddenly filled with swat guys all clad in fiercelooking helmets and thick vests dozens of them crouching and reaching they were a blur they grabbed us and carried us through the reception area to the elevators are you hurt they asked me i didnt know there was blood on my face and shirt and a sticky liquid that a doctor later described as cerebrospinal fluid three on the first floor as far away from mister as they could get the families and friends were waiting dozens of our associates and colleagues were packed in the offices and hallways waiting for our rescue a loud cheer went up when they saw us because i was covered with blood they took me to a small gym in the basement it was owned by our firm and virtually ignored by the lawyers we were too busy to exercise and anyone caught working out would almost certainly be assigned more work i was instantly surrounded by doctors none of whom happened to be my wife once i convinced them the blood was not mine they relaxed and conducted a routine exam blood pressure was up pulse was crazy they gave me a pill what i really wanted was a shower they made me lie on a table for ten minutes while they watched my blood pressure am i in shock i asked probably not i certainly felt like it where was claire for six hours i was held at gunpoint life hanging by a thread and she couldnt be bothered to come wait with the rest of the families the shower was long and hot i washed my hair three times with heavy shampoo then i stood and dripped for an eternity time was frozen nothing mattered i was alive breathing and steaming i changed into someone elses clean gym clothes which were much too big and went back to the table for another check of my blood pressure my secretary polly came in and gave me a long hug i needed it desperately she had tears in her eyes wheres claire i asked her on call ive tried calling the hospital polly knew there wasnt much left of the marriage are you okay she asked i think so i thanked the doctors and left the gym rudolph met me in the hall and gave me a clumsy embrace he used the word congratulations as if i had accomplished something no one expects you to work tomorrow he said did he think a day off would cure all my problems i havent thought about tomorrow i said you need some rest he added as if the doctors hadnt thought of this i wanted to speak to barry nuzzo but my fellow hostages had already left no one was injured just a few rope burns on the wrists with the carnage held to a minimum and the good guys up and smiling the excitement at drake and sweeney waned quickly most of the lawyers and staff had waited nervously on the first floor far away from mister and his explosives polly had my overcoat and i put it on over the large sweat suit my tasseled loafers looked odd but i didnt care there are some reporters outside polly said ah yes the media what a story not just your gardenvariety onthejob shooting but a bunch of lawyers held hostage by a street crazy but they didnt get their story did they the lawyers escaped the bad guy took a bullet the explosives fizzled when their owner hit the floor oh what couldve been a shot then a bomb a flash of white light as the windows shattered arms and legs landing in the street all duly recorded live by channel nine for the evenings lead story ill drive you home polly said follow me i was very thankful someone was telling me what to do my thoughts were slow and cumbersome one stillframe after another with no concept of plot or setting we left the ground floor through a service door the night air was sharp and cold and i breathed its sweetness until my lungs ached as polly ran to get her car i hid at the corner of the building and watched the circus out front there were police cars ambulances television vans even a fire truck they were packing and leaving one of the ambulances was parked with its rear to the building no doubt waiting to carry mister to the morgue im alive i am alive i said this over and over smiling for the first time im alive i closed my eyes tightly and offered a short but sincere prayer of thanks the sounds began coming back as we sat in silence polly behind the wheel driving slowly and waiting for me to say something i heard the piercing clap of the snipers rifle then the thud as it found its mark and the stampede as the other hostages scrambled off the table and through the door what had i seen i had glanced at the table where the seven were staring intently at the door then back to mister as he raised the gun and pointed it at umsteads head i was directly behind him when he was hit what stopped the bullet from leaving him and getting me bullets go through walls and doors and people he was not going to kill us i said barely loud enough to be heard polly was relieved to hear my voice what was he doing then i dont know what did he want he never said its amazing how little was actually said we sat for hours just looking at each other why wouldnt he talk to the police who knows that was his biggest mistake if hed kept the phones open i couldve convinced the cops that he was not going to kill us you dont blame the cops do you no remind me to write them letters are you working tomorrow what else would i do tomorrow just thought you might need a day off i need a year off one day wont help our apartment was the third floor of a rowhouse on p street in georgetown polly stopped at the curb i thanked her and got out and i could tell from the dark windows that claire was not home i met claire the week after i moved to dc i was just out of yale with a great job in a rich firm a brilliant future like the other fifty rookies in my class she was finishing her degree in political science at american university her grandfather was once the governor of rhode island and her family has been well connected for centuries drake and sweeney like most large firms treats the first year as a boot camp i worked fifteen hours a day six days a week and on sundays claire and i would have our weekly date sunday nights i was in the office we thought that if we got married we would have more time together at least we could share a bed but sleep was about all we did the wedding was large the honeymoon brief and when the luster wore off i was back at the office ninety hours a week during the third month of our union we actually went eighteen days without sex she counted she was a sport for the first few months but she grew weary of being neglected i did not blame her but young associates dont complain in the hallowed offices of drake and sweeney less than ten percent of each class will make partner so the competition is ruthless the rewards are great at least a million bucks a year billing lots of hours is more important than a happy wife divorce is common i didnt dream of asking rudolph to lighten my load by the end of our first year together claire was very unhappy and we had started to quarrel she decided to go to med school tired of sitting at home watching tv she figured she could become as selfabsorbed as i was i thought it was a wonderful idea it took away most of my guilt after four years with the firm they started dropping hints about our chances of making partner the hints were collected and compared among many of the associates it was generally felt that i was on the fast track to a partnership but i had to work even harder claire became determined to spend more time away from the apartment than i did and so both of us slid into the silliness of extreme workaholism we stopped fighting and simply drifted apart she had her friends and interests i had mine fortunately we did not make the mistake of reproducing i wish i had done things differently we were in love once and we let it get away as i entered the dark apartment i needed claire for the first time in years you come face to face with death and you need to talk about it you need to be needed to be stroked to be told that someone cares i fixed a vodka with ice and sat on the sofa in the den i fumed and pouted because i was alone then my thoughts switched to the six hours id spent with mister two vodkas later i heard her at the door she unlocked it and called michael i didnt say a word because i was still pouting and fuming she walked into the den and stopped when she saw me are you all right she asked with genuine concern im fine i said softly she dropped her bag and overcoat and walked to the sofa where she hovered over me where have you been i asked at the hospital of course i took a long drink look ive had a bad day i know all about it michael you do of course i do then where the hell were you at the hospital nine of us held hostage for six hours by a crazy man eight families show up because theyre somewhat concerned we get lucky and escape and i have to catch a ride home with my secretary i couldnt be there of course you couldnt how thoughtless of me she sat down in a chair next to the sofa we glared at each other they made us stay at the hospital she began very icy we knew about the hostage situation and there was a chance there couldre been casualties its standard procedure in that situationthey notify the hospitals and everyone is placed on standby another long drink as i tried to think of something sharp to say i couldnt help you at your office she continued i was waiting at the hospital did you call i tried the phone lines were jammed i finally got a cop and he hung up on me it was over two hours ago where have you been in or we lost a litfie boy in surgery he was hit by a car im sorry i said i could never comprehend how doctors faced so much death and pain mister was only the second corpse i had ever laid eyes on im sorry too she said and with that she went to the kitchen and returned with a glass of wine we sat in the semidarkness for a while because we did not practice communication it did not come easy do you want to talk about it she asked no not now and i really didnt the alcohol mixed with the pills and my breathing became heavy i thought of mister how calm and peaceful he was even though he waved a gun and had dynamite strapped to his stomach he was thoroughly unmoved by long stretches of silence silence was what i wanted tomorrow i would talk four the chemicals worked until four the next morning when i awoke to the harsh smell of misters sticky brain fluid weaving through my nostrils i was frantic for a moment in the darkness i rubbed my nose and eyes and thrashed around the sofa until i heard someone move claire was sleeping in a chair next to me its okay she said softly touching my shoulder just a bad dream would you get me some water i said and she went to the kitchen we talked for an hour i told her everything i could remember about the event she sat close to me rubbing my knee holding the glass of water listening carefully we had talked so little in the past few years she had to make her rounds at seven so we cooked breakfast together waffles and bacon we ate at the kitchen counter with a small television in front of us the six oclock news began with the hostage drama there were shots of the building during the crisis the mob outside some of my fellow captives hurriedly leaving when it was over at least one of the helicopters we had heard belonged to the news station and its camera had zoomed down for a tight shot of the window through it mister could be seen for a few seconds as he peeked out his name was devon hardy age fortyfive a vietnam vet with a short criminal record a mug shot from an arrest for burglary was put on the screen behind the early morning newsperson it looked nothing like misterno beard no glasses much younger he was described as homeless with a history of drug use no motive was known no family had come forward there were no comments from our side and the story fizzled the weather was next heavy snow was expected to hit by late afternoon it was the twelfth day of february and already a record had been set for snowfall claire drove me to the office where at sixforty i was not surprised to see my lexus parked among several other imports the lot was never empty we had people who slept at the office i promised to call her later in the morning and we would try to have lunch at the hospital she wanted me to take it easy at least for a day or two what was i supposed to do lie on the sofa and take pills the consensus seemed to be that i needed a day off after which i guessed i would be expected to return to my duties at full throttle i said good morning to the two very alert security guards in the lobby three of the four elevators were open waiting and i had a choice i stepped onto the one mister and i had taken and things slowed to a crawl a hundred questions at once why had he picked our building our firm where had he been in the moments before he entered the lobby where were the security guards who usually loitered near the front why me hundreds of lawyers came and went all day long why the sixth floor and what was he after i did not believe devon hardy went to the trouble of wrapping himself with explosives and risking his life humble as it was to chastise a bunch of wealthy lawyers over their lack of generosity he couldve found richer people and perhaps greedier ones his question who are the evictors was never answered but it wouldnt take long the elevator stopped and i stepped off this time without anyone behind me madam devier was still asleep at that hour somewhere and the sixth floor was quiet in front of her desk paused and stared at the two doors to the conference room i slowly opened the nearest one the one where umstead stood when the bullet shot over his head and into misters i took a long breath and flipped a light switch nothing had happened the conference table and chairs were in perfect order the oriental rug upon which mister died had been replaced with an even prettier one a fresh coat of paint covered the walls even the bullet hole in the ceiling above rafters spot was gone the powers that be at drake and sweeney had spent some dough the previous night to make sure the incident never occurred the room might attract a few of the curious throughout the day and there certainly could be nothing to gawk at it might make folks neglect their work for a minute or two there simply couldnt be any trace of street trash in our pristine offices it was a coldblooded coverup and sadly i understood the rationale behind it i was one of the rich white guys what did i expect a memorial a pile of flowers brought in by misters fellow street people i didnt know what i expected but the smell of fresh paint made me nauseous on my desk every morning in precisely the same spot were the wall street journal and the washington post i used to know the name of the person who put them there but it was long forgotten on the front page of the posts metro section below the fold was the same mug shot of devon hardy and a large story about yesterdays little crisis i read it quickly because i figured i knew more details than any reporter but i learned a few things the red sticks were not dynamite mister had taken a couple of broom handles sawed them into little pieces wrapped the ominous silver tape around them and scared the living hell out of us the gun was a automatic stolen because it was the post the story dealt more with devon hardy than with his victims though in all fairness and much to my satisfaction not a single word had been uttered by anyone at drake and sweeney according to one mordecai green director of the th street legal clinic devon hardy had worked for many years as a janitor at the national arboretum hed lost his job as a result of budget cutting he had served a few months in jail for burglary then landed in the streets hed struggled with alcohol and drugs and was routinely picked up for shoplifting greens clinic had represented him several times if there was family his lawyer knew nothing about it as to motive green had little to offer he did say that devon hardy had been evicted recently from an old warehouse in which he had been squatting an eviction is a legal procedure carried out by lawyers i had a pretty good idea which one of the thousands of dc firms had tossed mister into the streets the th street legal clinic was funded by a charity and worked only with the homeless according to green back when we got federal money we had seven lawyers now were down to two he said not surprisingly the journal didnt mention the story had any of the nine corporate lawyers in the nations fifthlargest silkstocking firm been killed or even slightly wounded it wouldve been on the front page thank god it wasnt a bigger story i was at my desk reading my papers in one piece with lots of work to do i couldve been at the morgue alongside mister polly arrived a few minutes before eight with a big smile and a plate of homemade cookies she was not surprised to see me at work in fact all nine of the hostages punched in most ahead of schedule it wouldve been a glaring sign of weakness to stay home with the wife and get pampered arthurs on the phone polly announced our firm had at least ten arthurs but only one prowled the hahs without the need of a last name arthur jacobs was the senior partner the ceo the driving force a man we admired and respected greatly if the firm had a heart and soul it was arthur in seven years i had spoken to him three times i told him i was fine he complimented me on my courage and grace under pressure and i almost felt like a hero i wondered how he knew he had probably talked to malamud first and was working his way down the ladder so the stories would begin then the jokes umstead and his porcelain vase would no doubt cause much hilarity arthur wanted to meet with the exhostages at ten in the conference room to record our statements on video why i asked the boys in litigation think its a good idea he said his voice razorsharp in spite of his eighty years his family will probably sue the cops of course i said and theyll probably name us as defendants people will sue for anything you know thank goodness i almost said where would we be without lawsuits i thanked him for his concern and he was gone off to call the next hostage the parade started before nine a steady stream of wellwishers and gossipers lingering by my office deeply concerned about me but also desperate for the details i had a pile of work to do but i couldnt get to it in the quiet moments between guests i sat and stared at the row of files awaiting my attention and i was numb my hands wouldnt reach it was not the same the work was not important my desk was not life and death i had seen death almost felt it and i was naive to think i could simply shrug it off and bounce back as if nothing had happened i thought about devon hardy and his red sticks with the multicolored wires running in all directions hed spent hours building his toys and planning his assault hed stolen a gun found our firm made a crucial mistake that cost him his life and no one not one single person i worked with gave a damn about him i finally left the traffic was getting worse and i was getting chatted up by people i couldnt stand two reporters called i told polly i had some errands to run and she reminded me of the meeting with arthur i went to my car started it and turned on the heater and sat for a long time debating whether to participate in the reenactment if i missed it arthur would be upset no one misses a meeting with arthur drove away it was a rare opportunity to do something stupid id been traumatized i had to leave arthur and the rest of the firm would just have to give me a break i drove in the general direction of georgetown but to no place in particular the clouds were dark people scurried along the sidewalks snow crews were getting ready i passed a beggar on m street and wondered if he knew devon hardy where do the street people go in a snowstorm i called the hospital and was informed that my wife would be in emergency surgery for several hours so much for our romantic lunch in the hospital cafeteria i turned and went northeast past logan circle into the rougher sections of the city until i found the th street legal clinic fourteenth at q nw i parked at the curb certain i would never again see my lexus the clinic occupied half of a threestory redbrick victorian mansion that had seen better days the windows on the top floor were boarded with aging plywood next door was a grungy laundromat the crack houses couldnt be far away the entrance was covered by a bright yellow canopy and i didnt know whether to knock or to just barge in the door wasnt locked and i slowly turned the knob and stepped into another world it was a law office of sorts but a very different one from the marble and mahogany of drake and sweeney in the large room before me there were four metal desks each covered with a suffocating collection of files stacked a foot high more files were placed haphazardly on the worn carpet around the desks the wastebaskets were filled and wadded sheets of legal paper had rolled off and onto the floor one wall was covered with file cabinets in a variety of colors the word processors and phones were ten years old the wooden bookshelves were sagging a large fading photograph of martin luther king hung crookedly on the back wall several smaller offices branched off the front room it was busy and dusty and i was fascinated with the place a fierce hispanic woman stopped typing after watching me for a moment you looking for somebody she asked it was more of a challenge than a request a receptionist at drake and sweeney would be fired on the spot for such a greeting she was sofia mendoza according to a nameplate tacked to the side of her desk and i would soon learn that she was more than a receptionist a loud roar came from one of the side rooms and startled me without amazing sofia im looking for mordecai green i said politely and at that moment he followed his roar and stomped out of his side office and into the main room the floor shook with each step tie was yelling across the room for someone named abraham sofia nodded at him then dismissed me and returned to her typing green was a huge black man at least six five with a wide frame that carried a lot of weight he was in his early fifties with a gray beard and round eyeglasses that were framed in red he took a look at me said nothing yelled again for abraham while sauntering across the creaking floor he disappeared into an office then emerged seconds later without abraham another look at me then can i help you i walked forward and introduced myself nice to meet you he said but only because he had to whats on your mind devon hardy i said he looked at me for a few seconds then glanced at sofia who was lost in her work he nodded toward his office and i followed him into a twelvebytwelve room with no windows and every square inch of available floor space covered with manilla files and battered law books i handed him my goldembossed drake and sweeney card which he studied with a deep frown then he gave it back to me and said slum umming arent you no i said taking the card what do you want i come in peace mr hardys bullet almost got me you were in the room with him yep he took a deep breath and lost the frown he pointed to the only chair on my side have a seat but you might get dirty we both sat my knees touching his desk my hands thrust deep into the pockets of my overcoat a radiator rattled behind him we looked at each other then looked away it was my visit i had to say something but he spoke first guess you had a bad day huh he said his raspy voice lower and almost compassionate not as bad as hardys i saw your name in the paper thats why i came im not sure what im supposed to do do you think the family will sue if so then maybe i should leave theres no family not much of a lawsuit i could make some noise with it i figure the cop who shot him is white so i could squeeze a few bucks out of the city probably get a nuisance settlement but thats not my idea of fun he waved his hand over the desk god knows i got enough to do i never saw the cop i said realizing it for the first time forget about a lawsuit is that why youre here i dont know why im here i went back to my desk this morning like nothing happened but i couldnt think straight i took a drive here i am he shook his head slowly as if he was trying to understand this you want some coffee no thanks you knew mr hardy pretty well yeah devon was a regular where is he now probably in the city morgue at dc general if theres no family what happens to him the city buries the unclaimed on the books its called a paupers funeral theres a cemetery near rfk stadium where they pack em in youd be amazed at the number of people who die unclaimed im sure i would in fact youd be amazed at every aspect of homeless life it was a soft jab and i was not in the mood to spar do you know if he had aids he cocked his head back looked at the ceiling and rattled that around for a few seconds why i was standing behind him the back of his head was blown off i got a face full of blood thats all with that i crossed the line from a bad guy to just an average white guy i dont think he had aids do they check them when they die the homeless yes most of the time yes devon though died by other means can you find out he shrugged and thawed some more sure he said reluctantly and took his pen from his pocket is that why youre here worried about aids i guess its one reason wouldnt you be sure abraham stepped in a small hyper man of about forty who had public interest lawyer stamped all over him jewish dark beard hornrimmed glasses rumpled blazer wrinkled khakis dirty sneakers and the weighty aura of one trying to save the world he did not acknowledge me and green was not one for social graces theyre predicting a ton of snow green said to him we need to make sure every possible shelter is open im working on it abraham snapped then abruptly left i know youre busy i said is that all you wanted a blood check yeah i guess any idea why he did it he removed his red glasses wiped them with a tissue then rubbed his eyes he was mentally ill like a lot of these people you spend years on the streets soaked with booze stoned on crack sleeping in the cold getting kicked around by cops and punks it makes you crazy plus he had a bone to pick the eviction yep a few months ago he moved into an abandoned warehouse at the corner of new york and florida somebody threw up some plywood chopped up the place and made little apartments wasnt a bad place as far as homeless folk goa roof some toilets water a hundred bucks a month payable to an expimp who fixed it up and claimed he owned it did he i think so he pulled a thin file from one of the stacks on his desk and miraculously it happened to be the one he wanted he studied its contents for a moment this is where it gets complicated the property was purchased last month by a company called riveroaks some big real estate outfit and riveroaks evicted everyone yep odds are then that riveroaks would be represented by my firm good odds yes why is it complicated ive heard it secondhand that they got no notice before the eviction the people claim they were paying rent to the pimp and if so then they were more than squatters they were tenants thus entitled to due process squatters get no notice none and it happens all the time street folk will move into an abandoned building and most of the time nothing happens so they thrink they own it the owner if hes inclined to show up can toss em without notice they have no rights at all how did devon hardy track down our firm who knows he wasnt stupid though crazy but not stupid do you know the pimp yeah completely unreliable where did you say the warehouse was its gone now they leveled it last week i had taken enough of his time he glanced at his watch i glanced at mine we swapped phone numbers and promised to keep in touch mordecai green was a warm caring man who labored on the streets protecting hordes of nameless clients his view of the law required more soul than i could ever muster on my way out i ignored sofia because she certainly ignored me my lexus was still parked at the curb already covered with an inch of snow five i drifted through the city as the snow fell i couldnt recall the last time i had driven the streets of dc without being late for a meeting i was warm and dry in my heavy luxury car and i simply moved with the traffic there was no place to go the office would be offlimits for a while what with arthur mad at me and id have to suffer through a hundred random dropins all of which would start with the phony how you doin my car phone rang it was polly panicky where are you she asked who wants to know a lot of people arthur for one rudolph another reporter called there are some clients in need of advice and claire called from the hospital what does she want shes worried like everybody else im fine polly tell everybody im at the doctors office are you no but i could be what did arthur say he didnt call rudolph did they were waiting for you let em wait a pause then a very slow okay when might you be dropping by dont know i guess whenever the doctor releases me why dont you go home were in the middle of a storm ill call you tomorrow i hung up on her the apartment was a place i had rarely seen in the light of day and i couldnt stand the thought of sitting by the fire and watching it snow if i went to a bar id probably never leave so i drove i flowed with the traffic as the commuters began a hasty retreat into the maryland and virginia suburbs and i breezed along nearempty streets coming back into the city i found the cemetery near rfk where they buffed the unclaimed and i passed the methodist mission on seventeenth where last nights uneaten dinner originated i drove through sections of the city i had never been near and probably would never see again by four the city was empty the skies were darkening the snow was quite heavy several inches already covered the ground and they were predicting a lot more of course not even a snowstorm could shut down drake and sweeney i knew lawyers there who loved midnights and sundays because the phones didnt ting a heavy snow was a delightful respite from the grueling drudgery of nonstop meetings and conference calls i was informed by a security guard in the lobby that the secretaries and most of the staff had been sent home at three i took misters elevator again in a neat row in the center of my desk were a dozen pink phone messages none of which interested me i went to my computer and began searching our client index riveroaks was a delaware corporation organized in headquartered in hagerstown maryland it was privately held thus little financial information was available the attorney was n braden chance a name unknown to me i looked him up in our vast database chance was a partner in our real estate division somewhere down on the fourth floor age fortyfour married law school at duke undergrad at gettysburg an impressive but thoroughly predictable resumandeacute with eight hundred lawyers threatening and suing daily our firm had over thirtysix thousand active files to make sure our office in new york didnt sue one of our clients in chicago each new file was entered immediately into our data system every lawyer secretary and paralegal at drake and sweeney had a pc and thus instant access to general information about all fles if one of our probate attorneys in palm beach handled the estate of a rich client i could if i were so inclined punch a few keys and learn the basics of our representation there were fortytwo files for riveroaks almost all of them real estate transactions in which the company had purchased property chance was the attorney of record on every file four were eviction actions three of which took place last year the first phase of the search was easy on january riveroaks purchased property on florida avenue the seller was tag inc on february our client evicted a number of squatters from an abandoned warehouse on the propertyone of whom i now knew was mister devon hardy who took the eviction personally and somehow tracked down the lawyers i copied the file name and number and strolled to the fourth floor no one joined a large firm with the goal of becoming a real estate lawyer there were far more glamorous arenas in which to establish reputations litigation was the alltime favorite and the litigators were still the most revered of all gods lawyers at least within the firm a few of the corporate fields attracted top talent mergers and acquisitions was still hot securities was an old favorite my field antitrust was highly regarded tax law was horribly complex but its practitioners were greatly admired governmental relations lobbying was repulsive but paid so well that every dc firm had entire wings of lawyers greasing the skids but no one set out to be a real estate lawyer i didnt know how it happened they kept to themselves no doubt reading fine print in mortgage documents and were treated as slightly inferior lawyers by the rest of the firm at drake and sweeney each lawyer kept his current files in his office often under lock and key only the retired files were accessible by the rest of the firm no lawyer could be compelled to show a file to another lawyer unless requested by a senior partner or a member of the firms executive committee the eviction file i wanted was still listed as current and after the mister episode i was certain it was well protected i saw a paralegal scanning blueprints at a desk next to a secretarial pool and i asked him where i might find the office of braden chance he nodded to an open door across the hall to my surprise chance was at his desk projecting the appearance of a very busy lawyer he was perturbed by my intrusion and rightfully so proper protocol would have been for me to call ahead and set up a meeting i wasnt worried about protocol he didnt ask me to sit i did so anyway and that didnt help his mood you were one of the hostages he said irritably when he made the connection yes i was mustre been awful its over the guy with the gun the late mr hardy was evicted from a warehouse on february was it one of our evictions it was he snapped because of his defensiveness i guessed the file had been picked through during the day hed probably reviewed it thoroughly with arthur and the brass what about it was he a squatter damned sure was theyre all squatters our client is trying to clean up some of that mess are you sure he was a squatter his chin dropped and his eyes turned red then he took a breath what are you after could i see the file no its none of your business maybe it is who is your supervising partner he yanked out his pen as if to take down the name of the person who would reprimand me rudolph mayes he wrote in large strokes im very busy he said would you please leave why cant i see the file because its mine and i said no hows that maybe thats not good enough its good enough for you why dont you leave he stood his hand shaking as he pointed to the door i smiled at him and left the paralegal heard everything and we exchanged puzzled looks as i passed his desk what an ass he said very quietly almost mouthing the words i smiled again and nodded my agreement an ass and a fool if chance had been pleasant and explained that arthur or some other honcho from above had ordered the file sealed then i wouldnt have been as suspicious but it was obvious there was something in the file getting it would be the challenge with all the cell phones claire and i ownedpocket purse and car not to mention a couple of pagerscommunication shouldve been a simple matter but nothing was simple with our marriage we hooked up around nine she was exhausted from another one of her days which were inevitably more fatiguing than anything i could possibly have done it was a game we shamelessly playedmy job is more important because im a doctorlawyer i was tiring of the games i could tell she was pleased that my brush with death had produced aftershocks that id left the office to wander the streets no doubt her day had been far more productive than mine her goal was to become the greatest female neurosurgeon in the country a brain surgeon even males would turn to when all hope was lost she was a brilliant student fiercely determined blessed with enormous stamina she would bury the men just as she was slowly burying me a wellseasoned marathon man from the halls of drake and sweeney the race was getting old she drove a miata sports car no fourwheel drive and i was worried about her in the bad weather she would be through in an hour and it would take that long for me to drive to georgetown hospital i would pick her up there and we would try to find a restaurant if not it would be chinese carryout our standard fare i began arranging papers and objects on my desk careful to ignore the neat row of my ten most current files i kept only ten on my desk a method id learned from rudolph and i spent time with each file every day billing was a factor my top ten invariably included the wealthiest clients regardless of how presshag their legal problems another trick from rudolph i was expected to bill twentyfive hundred hours a year thats fifty hours a week fifty weeks a year my average billing rate was three hundred dollars an hour so i would gross for my beloved firm a total of seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars they paid me a hundred and twenty thousand of this plus another thirty for benefits and assigned two hundred thousand to overhead the partners kept the rest divided annually by some horrendously complex formula that usually caused fistfights it was rare for one of our partners to earn less than a million a year and some earned over two and once i became a partner i would be a partner for life so if i made it when i was thirtyfive which happened to be the fast track i was on then i could expect thirty years of glorious earnings and immense wealth that was the dream that kept us at our desks at all hours of the day and night i was scribbling these numbers something i did all the time and something i suspect every lawyer in our firm did when the phone rang it was mordecai green mr brock he said politely his voice clearly audible but competing with a din in the background yes please call me michael very well look i made some calls and you have nothing to worry about the blood test was negative thank you dont mention it just thought youd want to know as soon as possible thanks i said again as the racket rose behind him where are you at a homeless shelter a big snow brings em in faster than we can feed them so it takes all of us to keep up gotta run the desk was old mahogany the rug was persian the chairs were a rich crimson leather the technology was stateoftheart and as i studied my finely appointed office i wondered for the first time in many years there how much all of it cost werent we just chasing money why did we work so hard to buy a richer rug an older desk there in the warmth and coziness of my beautiful room i thought of mordecai green who at that moment was volunteering his time in a busy shelter serving food to the cold and hungry no doubt with a warm smile and a pleasant word both of us had law degrees both of us had passed the same bar exam both of us were fluent in the tongue of legalese we were kindred to some degree i helped my clients swallow up competitors so they could add more zeros to the bottom line and for this i would become rich he helped his clients eat and find a warm bed i looked at the scratchings on my legal padthe earnings and the years and the path to wealthand i was saddened by them such blatant and unashamed greed the phone startled me why are you at the office claire asked each word spoken slowly because each word was covered with ice i looked in disbelief at my watch i uh well a client called from the west coast its not snowing out there i think it was a lie id used before it didnt matter i am waiting michael should i walk no ill be there as fast as i can id kept her waiting before it was part of the gamewe were much too busy to be prompt i ran from the building into the storm not really too concerned that another night had been ruined six the snow had finally stopped claire and i sipped our coffee by the kitchen window i was reading the paper by the light of a brilliant morning sun they had managed to keep national airport open lets go to florida i said now she gave me a withering look florida okay the bahamas we can be there by early afternoon theres no way sure there is im not going to work for a few days and why not because im cracking up and around the firm if you crack up then you get a few days off you are cracking up i know its kinda dim really people give you space treat you with velvet gloves kiss your ass might as well make the most of it the tight face returned and she said i cant and that was the end of that it was a whim and i knew she had too many obligations it was a cruel thing to do i decided as i returned to the paper but i didnt feel bad about it she wouldnt have gone with me under any circumstances she was suddenly in a hurryappointments classes rounds the life of an ambitious young surgical resident she showered and changed and was ready to go i drove her to the hospital we didnt talk as we inched through the snowfilled streets im going to memphis for a couple of days i said matteroffactly when we arrived at the hospital entrance on reservoir street oh really she said with no discernible reaction i need to see my parents its been almost a year i figure this is a good time i dont do well in snow and im not in the mood for work cracking up you know well call me she said opening her door then she shut itno kiss no goodbye no concern i watched her hurry down the sidewalk and disappear into the building it was over and i hated to tell my mother my parents were in their early sixties both healthy and trying gamely to enjoy forced retirement dad was an airline pilot for thirty years mom had been a bank manager they worked hard saved well and provided a comfortable uppermiddleclass home for us my two brothers and i had the best private schools we could get into they were solid people conservative patriotic free of bad habits fiercely devoted to each other they went to church on sundays the parade on july the fourth rotary club once a week and they traveled whenever they wanted they were still grieving over my brother warners divorce three years earlier he was an attorney in atlanta who married his college sweetheart a memphis girl from a family we knew after two kids the marriage went sour his wife got custody and moved to portland my parents got to see the grandkids once a year if all went well it was a subject i never brought up i rented a car at the memphis airport and drove east into the sprawling suburbs where the white people lived the blacks had the city the whites the suburbs sometimes the blacks would move into a subdivision and the whites would move to another one farther away memphis crept eastward the races running from each other my parents lived on a golf course in a new glass house designed so that every window overlooked a fairway i hated the house because the fairway was always busy i didnt express my opinions though i had called from the airport so mother was waiting with great anticipation when i arrived dad was on the back nine somewhere you look tired she said after the hug and kiss it was her standard greeting thanks mom you look great and she did slender and bronze from her daily tennis and tanning regimen at the country club she fixed iced tea and we drank it on the patio where we watched other retirees fly down the fairway in their golf carts whats wrong she said before a minute passed before i took the first sip nothing im fine wheres claire you guys never call us you know i havent heard her voice in two months claires fine mom were both alive and healthy and working very hard are you spending enough time together no are you spending any time together not much she frowned and rolled her eyes with motherly concern are you having trouble she asked on the attack yes i knew it i knew it i could tell by your voice on the phone that something was wrong surely youre not headed for a divorce too have you tried counseling no slow down then why not shes a wonderful person michael give the marriage everything you have were trying mother but its difficult affairs drugs alcohol gambling any of the bad things no just two people going their separate ways i work eighty hours a week she works the other eighty then slow down money isnt everything her voice broke just a little and i saw wetness in her eyes im sorry mom at least we dont have kids she bit her lip and tried to be strong but she was dying inside and i knew exactly what she was thinking two down one to go she would take my divorce as a personal failure the same way she broke down with my brothers she would find some way to blame herself i didnt want the pity to move things along to more interesting matters i told her the story of mister and for her benefit downplayed the danger id been in if the story made the memphis paper my parents had missed it are you all right she asked horrified of course the bullet missed me im here oh thank god i mean well emotionally are you all right yes mother im all together no broken pieces the firm wanted me to take a couple of days off so i came home you poor thing claire and now this im fine we had a lot of snow last night and it was a good time to leave is claire safe as safe as anybody in washington she lives at the hospital probably the smartest place to be in that city i worry about you so much i see the crime statistics you know its a very dangerous city almost as dangerous as memphis we watched a ball land near the patio and waited for its owner to appear a stout lady rolled out of a golf cart hovered over the ball for a second then shanked it badly mother left to get more tea and to wipe her eyes i dont know which of my parents got the worst end of my visit my mother wanted strong families with lots of grandchildren my father wanted his boys to move quickly up the ladder and enjoy the rewards of our hardearned success late that afternoon my dad and i did nine holes he played i drank beer and drove the cart golf had yet to work its magic on me two cold ones and i was ready to talk i had repeated the mister tale over lunch so he figured i was just loafing for a couple of days collecting myself before i roared back into the arena im getting kind of sick of the big firm dad i said as we sat by the third tee waiting for the foursome ahead to clear i was nervous and my nervousness irritated me greatly it was my life not his whats that supposed to mean means im tired of what im doing welcome to the real world you think the guy working a drill press in a factory doesnt get tired of what hes doing at least youre getting rich so he took round one almost by a knockout two holes later as we stomped through the rough looking for his ball he said are you changing jobs thinking about it where are you going i dont know its too early i havent been looking for another position then how do you know the grass is greener if you havent been looking he picked up his ball and walked off i drove alone on the narrow paved trail while he stalked down the fairway chasing his shot and i wondered why that grayhaired man out there scared me so much he had pushed all of his sons to set goals work hard strive to be big men with everything aimed at making lots of money and living the american dream he had certainly paid for anything we needed like my brothers i was not born with a social conscience we gave offerings to the church because the bible strongly suggests it we paid taxes to the government because the law requires it surely somewhere in the midst of all this giving some good would be done and we had a hand in it politics belonged to those willing to play that game and besides there was no money to be made by honest people we were taught to be productive and the more success we attained the more society would benefit in some way set goals work hard play fair achieve prosperity he doublebogeyed the fifth hole and was blaming it on his putter when he climbed into the cart maybe im not looking for greener pastures i said why dont you just go ahead and say what youre trying to say he said as usual i felt weak for not facing the issue boldly im thinking about public interest law what the hell is that its when you work for the good of society without making a lot of money what are you a democrat now youve been in washington too long there are lots of republicans in washington in fact theyve taken over we rode to the next tee in silence he was a good golfer but his shots were getting worse id broken his concentration stomping through the rough again he said so some wino gets his head blown off and you gotta change society is that it he wasnt a wino he fought in vietnam dad flew bs in the early years of vietnam and this stopped him cold but only for a second he wasnt about to yield an inch one of those huh i didnt respond the ball was hopelessly lost and he wasnt really looking he flipped another onto the fairway hooked it badly and away we went i hate to see you blow a good career son he said youve worked too hard youll be a partner in a few years maybe you need some time off thats all that seemed to be everybodys remedy i took them to dinner at a nice restaurant we worked hard to avoid the topics of claire my career and the grandkids they seldom saw we talked about old friends and old neighborhoods i caught up on the gossip none of which interested me in the least i left them at noon on friday four hours before my flight and i headed back to my muddled life in dc seven of course the apartment was empty when i returned friday night but with a new twist there was a note on the kitchen counter following my cue claire had gone home to providence for a couple of days no reason was given she asked me to phone when i got home i called her parents and interrupted dinner i labored through a fiveminute chat in which it was determined that both of us were indeed fine memphis was fine and so was providence the families were fine and she would return sometime sunday afternoon i hung up fixed coffee and drank a cup staring out the bedroom window watching the traffic crawl along p street still covered with snow if any of the snow had melted it wasnt obvious i suspected claire was telling her parents the same dismal story i had burdened mine with it was sad and odd and yet somehow not surprising that we were being honest with our families before we faced the truth ourselves i was fired of it and determined that one day very soon perhaps as early as sunday we would sit somewhere probably at the kitchen table and confront reality we would lay bare our feelings and fears and i was quite sure start planning our separate futures i knew she wanted out i just didnt know how badly i practiced the words i would say to her out loud until they sounded convincing then i went for a long walk it was ten degrees with a sharp wind and the chill cut through my trench coat i passed the handsome homes and cozy rowhouses where i saw real families eating and laughing and enjoying the warmth and moved onto m street where throngs of those suffering from cabin fever filled the sidewalks even a freezing friday night on m was never dull the bars were packed the restaurants had waiting lines the coffee shops were filled i stood at the window of a music club listening to the blues with snow packed around my ankles watching the young couples drink and dance for the first time in my life i felt like something other than a young person i was thirtytwo but in the last seven years i had worked more than most people do in twenty i was fired not old but bearing down hard on middle age and i admitted that i was no longer fresh from college those pretty girls in there would never look twice at me now i was frozen and it was snowing again i bought a sandwich stuffed it into a pocket and slogged my way back to the apartment i fixed a strong drink and a small fire and i ate in the semidarkness very much alone in the old days claires absence for the weekend would have given me guiltfree grounds to live at the office sitting by the fire i was repulsed by that thought drake and sweeney would be standing proudly long after i was gone and the clients and their problems which had seemed so crucial would be tended to by other squads of young lawyers my departure would be a slight bump in the road for the firm scarcely noticeable my office would be taken minutes after i walked out at some time after nine the phone rang jolting me from a long somber daydream it was mordecai green speaking loudly into a cell phone are you busy he asked uh not exactly whats going on its cold as hell snowing again and were short on manpower do you have a few hours to spare to do what to work we really need able bodies down here the shelters and soup kitchens are packed and we dont have enough volunteers im not sure im qualified can you spread peanut butter on bread i think so then youre qualified okay where do i go were ten blocks or so from the office at the intersection of thirteenth and euclid youll see a yellow church on your right ebenezer christian fellowship were in the basement i scribbled this down each word getting shakier because mordecai was calling me into a combat zone i wanted to ask if i should pack a gun i wondered if he carried one but he was black and i wasnt what about my car my prized lexus got that he growled after a pause yeah be there in twenty minutes i said bravely my heart already pounding i changed into jeans a sweatshirt and designer hiking boots i took the credit cards and most of the cash out of my wallet in the top of a closet i found an old woollined denim jacket stained with coffee and paint a relic from law school and as i modeled it in the mirror i hoped it made me look nonaffluent it did not if a young actor wore it on the cover of vanity fair a trend would start immediately i desperately wanted a bulletproof vest i was scared but as i locked the door and stepped into the snow i was also strangely excited the driveby shootighs and gang attacks i had expected did not materialize the weather kept the streets empty and safe for the moment i found the church and parked in a lot across the street it looked like a small cathedral at least a hundred years old and no doubt abandoned by its original congregation around a comer i saw some men huddled together waiting by a door i brushed past them as if i knew exactly where i was going and i entered the world of the homeless as badly as i wanted to barge ahead to pretend i had seen this before and had work to do i couldnt move i gawked in amazement at the sheer number of poor people stuffed into the basement some were lying on the floor trying to sleep some were sitting in groups talking in low tones some were eating at long tables and others in their folding chairs every square inch along the walls was covered with people sitting with their backs to the cinder blocks small children cried and played as their mothers tried to keep them close winos lay rigid snoring through it all volunteers passed out blankets and walked among the throng handing out apples the kitchen was at one end bustling with action as food was prepared and served i could see mordecai in the background pouring fruit juice into paper cups talking incessantly a line waited patiently at the serving tables the room was warm and the odors and aromas and the gas heat mixed to create a thick smell that was not unpleasant a homeless man bundled up much like mister bumped into me and it was time to move i went straight to mordecai who was delighted to see me we shook hands like old friends and he introduced me to two volunteers whose names i never heard its crazy he said a big snow a cold snap and we work all night grab that bread over there he pointed to a tray of sliced white bread i took it and followed him to a table its real complicated you got bologna here mustard and mayo there half the sandwiches get mustard half get mayo one slice of bologna two slices of bread do a dozen with peanut butter every now and then got it yeah you catch on quick he slapped me on the shoulder and disappeared i hurriedly made ten sandwiches and declared myself to be proficient then i slowed and began to watch the people as they waited in line their eyes downcast but always glancing at the food ahead they were handed a paper plate a plastic bowl and spoon and a napkin as they shuffled along the bowl was filled with soup half a sandwich was placed on the plate then an apple and a small cookie were added a cup of apple juice was waiting at the end most of them said a quiet thanks to the volunteer handing out the juice then they moved away gingerly holding the plate and bowl even the children were still and careful with their food most seemed to eat slowly savoring the warmth and feel of food in their mouths the aroma in their faces others ate as fast as possible next to me was a gas stove with four burners each with a large pot of soup cooking away on the other side of it a table was covered with celery carrots onions tomatoes and whole chickens a volunteer with a large knife was chopping and dicing with a vengeance two more volunteers manned the stove several hauled the food to the serving tables for the moment i was the only sandwich man we need more peanut butter sandwiches mordecai announced as he returned to the kitchen he reached under the table and grabbed a twogallon jug of generic peanut butter can you handle it im an expert i said he watched me work the line was momentarily short he wanted to talk i thought you were a lawyer i said spreading peanut butter im a human first then a lawyer its possible to be bothnot quite so much on the spread there we have to be efficient where does the food come from food bank its all donated tonight were lucky because we have chicken thats a delicacy usually its just vegetables this bread is not too fresh yes but its free comes from a large bakery their dayold stuff you can have a sandwich if you like thanks i just had one do you eat here rarely from the looks of his girth mordecai had not maintained a diet of vegetable soup and apples he sat on the edge of the table and studied the crowd is this your first trip to a shelter yep whats the first word that comes to mind hopeless thats predictable but youll get over it how many people live here none this is just an emergency shelter the kitchen is open every day for lunch and dinner but its not technically a shelter the church is kind enough to open its doors when the weather is bad i tried to understand this then where do these people live some are squatters they live in abandoned buildings and theyre the lucky ones some live on the streets some in parks some in bus stations some under bridges they can survive there as long as the weather is tolerable tonight they would freeze then where are the shelters scattered about there are about twentyhalf privately funded the other half run by the city which thanks to the new budget will soon close two of them how many beds five thousand give or take how many homeless thats always a good question because theyre not the easiest group to count ten thousand is a good guess ten thousand yep and thats just the people on the street there are probably another twenty thousand living with families and friends a month or two away from homelessness so there are at least five thousand people on the streets i said my disbelief obvious at least a volunteer asked for sandwiches mordecai helped me and we made another dozen then we stopped and watched the crowd again the door opened and a young mother entered slowly holding a baby and followed by three small children one of whom wore a pair of shorts and mismatched socks no shoes a towel was draped over its shoulders the other two at least had shoes but little clothing the baby appeared to be asleep the mother seemed dazed and once inside the basement was uncertain where to go next there was not a spot at a table she led her family toward the food and two smiling volunteers stepped forward to help one parked them in a corner near the kitchen and began serving them food while the other covered them with blankets mordecai and i watched the scene develop i tried not to stare but who cared what happens to her when the storm is over i asked who knows why dont you ask her that put me on the spot i was not ready to get my hands dirty are you active in the dc bar association he asked somewhat why just curious the bar does a lot of pro bono work with the homeless he was fishing and i wasnt about to get caught i work on death penalty cases i said proudly and somewhat truthfully four years earlier i had helped one of our partners write a brief for an inmate in texas my firm preached pro bono to all its associates but the free work had damned well better not interfere with the billings we kept watching the mother and her four children the two toddlers ate their cookies first while the soup was cooling the mother was either stoned or in shock is there a place she can go to right now and live i asked probably not mordecai answered nonchalantly his large feet swinging from the edge of the table as of yesterday the waiting list for emergency shelter had five hundred names on it for emergency shelter yep theres one hypothermia shelter the city graciously opens when the temperature drops below freezing that might be her only chance but im sure its packed tonight the city is then kind enough to close the shelter when things thaw the souschef had to leave and since i was the nearest volunteer who wasnt busy at the moment i was pressed into duty while mordecai made sandwiches i chopped celery carrots and onions for an hour all under the careful eye of miss dolly one of the founding members of the church whod been in charge of feeding the homeless for eleven years now it was her kitchen i was honored to be in it and i was told at one point that my chunks of celery were too large they quickly became smaller her apron was white and spotless and she took enormous pride in her work do you ever get used to seeing these people i asked her at one point we were standing in front of the stove distracted by an argument in the back somewhere mordecai and the minister intervened and peace prevailed never honey she said wiping her hands on a towel it still breaks my heart but in proverbs it says happy is the man who feeds the poor that keeps me going she turned and gently stirred the soup chickens ready she said in my direction what does that mean means you take the chicken off the stove pour the broth into that pot let the chicken cool then bone it there was an art to boning especially using miss dollys method my fingers were hot and practically blistered when i finished eight mordecai led me up a dark stairway to the foyer watch your step he said almost in a whisper as we pushed through a set of swinging doors into the sanctuary it was dim because people were trying to sleep everywhere they were sprawled on the pews snoring they were squirming under the pews mothers trying to make children be still they were huddled in the aisles leaving a narrow path for us as we worked our way toward the pulpit the choir loft was filled with them too not many churches will do this he whispered as we stood near the altar table and surveyed the rows of pews i could understand their reluctance what happens sunday i whispered back depends on the weather the reverend is one of us he has on occasion canceled worship instead of running them out i was not sure what one of us meant but i didnt feel like a member of the club i heard the ceiling creak and realized that there was a ushaped balcony above us i squinted and slowly focused on another mass of humanity layered in the rows of seats up there mordecai was looking too how many people i mumbled unable to finish the thought we dont count we just feed and shelter a gust of wind hit the side of the building and rattled the windows it was considerably colder in the sanctuary than in the basement we tiptoed over bodies and left through a door by the organ it was almost eleven the basement was still crowded but the soup line was gone follow me mordecai said he took a plastic bowl and held it forth for a volunteer to fill lets see how well you cook he said with a smile we sat in the middle of the pack at a folding table with street people at our elbows he was able to eat and chat as if everything was fine i wasnt i played with my soup which thanks to miss dolly was really quite good but i couldnt get beyond the fact that i michael brock an affluent white boy from memphis and yale and drake and sweeney was sitting among the homeless in the basement of a church in the middle of northwest dc i had seen one other white face that of a middleaged wino who had eaten and disappeared i was sure my lexus was gone certain i could not survive five minutes outside the building i vowed to stick to mordecai whenever and however he decided to leave this is good soup he pronounced it varies he explained depends on whats available and the recipe is different from place to place i got noodles the other day at marthas table said the man sitting to my right a man whose elbow was closer to my bowl than my own noodles mordecai asked in mock disbelief in your soup yep bout once a month you get noodles course everybody knows it now so its hard to get a table i couldnt tell if he was joking or not but there was a twinkle in his eye the idea of a homeless man lamenting the lack of tables in his favorite soup kitchen struck me as humorous hard to get a table how many times had heard that from friends in georgetown mordecai smiled whats your name he asked the man i would learn that mordecai always wanted a name to go with a face the homeless he loved were more than victims they were his people it was a natural curiosity for me too i wanted to know how the homeless became homeless what broke in our vast system of public assistance to allow americans to become so poor they lived under bridges drano he said chomping on one of my larger celery chunks drano mordecai said drano the man repeated whats your last name dont have one too poor who gave you the name drano my momma how old were you when she gave you the name drano bout five why drano she had this baby who wouldnt shut up cried all the time nobody could sleep i fed it some drano he told the story while stirring his soup it was well rehearsed well delivered and i didnt believe a word of it but others were listening and drano was enjoying himself what happened to the baby mordecai asked playing the straight guy died that would be your brother mordecai said nope sister i see so you killed your sister yeah but we got plenty of sleep after that mordecai winked at me as if hed heard similar tales where do you live drano i asked here in dc where do you stay mordecai asked correcting my vernacular stay here and there i got a lot of rich women who pay me to keep them company two men on the other side of drano found this amusing one snickered the other laughed where do you get your mail mordecai asked post office he replied drano would have a quick answer for every question so we left him alone miss doily made coffee for the volunteers after she had turned off her stove the homeless were bedding down for the night mordecai and i sat on the edge of a table in the darkened kitchen sipping coffee and looking through the large serving window at the huddled masses how late will you stay i asked he shrugged depends you get a coupla hundred people like this in one room something usually happens the reverend would feel better if i stay all night ive done it many times i hadnt planned on sleeping with these people nor had i planned on leaving the building without mordecai to guard me feel free to leave whenever you want he said leaving was the worst of my limited options midnight friday night on the streets of dc white boy beautiful car snow or not i didnt like my odds out there you have a family i asked yes my wife is a secretary in the department of labor three sons ones in college ones in the army his voice trailed away before he got to son number three i wasnt about to ask and one we lost on the streets ten years ago gangs im sorry what about you married no kids i thought about claire for the first time in several hours how would she react if she knew where i was neither of us had found time for anything remotely related to charity work she would mumble to herself hes really cracking up or something to that effect i didnt care what does your wife do he asked making light conversation shes a surgical resident at georgetown you guysll have it made wont you youll be a partner in a big firm shell be a surgeon another american dream i guess the reverend appeared from nowhere and pulled mordecai deep into the kitchen for a hushed conversation i took four cookies from a bowl and walked to the corner where the young mother sat sleeping with her head propped on a pillow and the baby tucked under her arm the toddlers were motionless under the blankets but the oldest child was awake i squatted close to him and held out a cookie his eyes glowed and he grabbed it i watched him eat every bite then he wanted another he was small and bony no more than four years old the mothers head fell forward jolting her she looked at me with sad tired eyes then realized i was playing cookie man she offered a faint smile then rearranged the pillow whats your name i whispered to the little boy after two cookies he was my friend for life ontario he said slowly and plainly how old are you he held up four fingers then folded one down then raised it again four i asked he nodded and extended his hand for another cookie which i gladly gave him i would have given him anything where do you stay i whispered in a car he whispered back it took a second for this to sink in i wasnt sure what to ask next he was too busy eating to worry about conversation i had asked three questions hed given three honest answers they lived in a car i wanted to run and ask mordecai what you do when you find people who live in a car but i kept smiling at ontario he smiled back he finally said you got more apple juice sure i said and walked to the kitchen where i filled two cups he gulped one down and i handed him the second cup say thanks i said thanks he said and stuck out his hand for another cookie i found a folding chair and took a position next to ontario with my back to the wall the basement was quiet at times but never still those who live without beds do not sleep calmly occasionally mordecai would pick his way around the bodies to settle some flareup he was so large and intimidating that no one dared challenge his authority with his stomach filled again ontario dozed off his litfie head resting on his mothers feet i slipped into the kitchen poured another cup of coffee and went back to my chair in the corner then the baby erupted its pitiful voice wailed forth with amazing volume and the entire room seemed to tipple with the noise the mother was dazed tired frustrated at having been aroused from sleep she told it to shut up then placed it on her shoulder and rocked back and forth it cried louder and there were rumblings from the other campers with a complete lack of sense or thought i reached over and took the child smiling at the mother as i did so in an attempt to win her confidence she didnt care she was relieved to get rid of it the child weighed nothing and the damned thing was soaking wet i realized this as i gently placed its head on my shoulder and began patting its rear i moved to the kitchen desperately searching for mordecai or another volunteer to rescue me miss dolly had left an hour earlier to my relief and surprise the child grew quiet as i walked around the stove patting and cooing and looking for a towel or something my hand was soaked where was i what the hell was i doing what would my friends think if they could see me in the dark kitchen humming to a little street baby praying that the diaper was only wet i didnt smell anything foul though i was certain i could feel lice jumping from its head to mine my best friend mordecai appeared and turned on a switch how cute he said do we have any diapers i hissed at him big job or little job he asked happily walking toward the cabinets i dont know just hurry he pulled out a pack of pampers and i thrust the child at him my denim jacket had a large wet spot on the left shoulder with incredible deftness he placed the baby on the cutting board removed the wet diaper revealing a baby girl cleaned her with a wipe of some sort rediapered her with a fresh pamper then thrust her back at me there she is he said proudly good as new the things they dont teach you in law school i said taking the child i paced the floor with her for an hour until she fell asleep i wrapped her in my jacket and gently placed her between her mother and ontario it was almost am saturday and i had to go my freshly pricked conscience could take only so much in one day mordecai walked me to the street thanked me for coming and sent me away madess into the night my car was sitting where i left it covered with new snow he was standing in front of the church watching me as i drove away nine since my runin with mister on tuesday i had not billed a single hour for dear old drake and sweeney id been averaging two hundred a month for five years which meant eight per day for six days with a couple left over no day could be wasted and precious few hours left unaccounted for when i fell behind which rarely happened i would work twelve hours on a saturday and perhaps do the same on a sunday and if i wasnt behind i would do only seven or eight hours on saturday and maybe a few on sunday no wonder claire went to med school as i stared at the bedroom ceiling late saturday morning i was almost paralyzed with inaction i did not want to go to the office i hated the thought i dreaded the neat little rows of pink phone messages polly had on my desk the memos from higherups arranging meetings to inquire about my wellbeing the nosy chitchat from the gossipers and the inevitable how you doin from friends and those genuinely concerned and those who couldnt care less what i dreaded most though was the work antitrust cases are long and arduous with files so thick they require boxes and what was the point anyway one billiondollar corporation fighting another a hundred lawyers involved all cranking out paper i admitted to myself that id never loved the work it was a means to an end if i practiced it with a fury became a whiz and perfected a specialty then one day soon i would be in demand it couldve been tax or labor or litigation who could love antitrust law by sheer will i forced myself out of bed and into the shower breakfast was a croissant from a bakery on m with strong coffee all taken with one hand on the wheel i wondered what ontario was having for breakfast then told myself to stop the torture i had the right to eat without feeling guilty but food was losing its importance for me the radio said the days high would be twenty degrees the low near zero with no more snow for a week i made it as far as the buildings lobby before being accosted by one of my brethren bruce somebody from communications stepped onto the elevator when i did and said gravely how you doin pal fine you i shot back okay look were pulling for you you know hang in there i nodded as if his support was crucial mercifully he left on the second floor but not before favoring me with a lockerroom pat on the shoulder give em hell bruce i was damaged goods my steps were slower as i passed madam deviers desk and the conference room i went down the marble hallway until i found my office and slumped into the leather swivel exhausted polly had several ways of leaving behind the phone litter if i had been diligent in returning calls and if she happened to be pleased with my efforts she would leave one or two message slips near my phone if however i had not and if this happened to displease her then she liked nothing better than to line them up in the center of my desk a sea of pink all perfectly arranged in chronological order i counted thirtynine messages several urgent several from the brass rudolph especially seemed to be irritated judging by pollys trail read them slowly as i collected them then set them aside i was determined to finish my coffee in peace and without pressure and so i was sitting at my desk holding the cup with both hands staring into the unknown looking very much like someone teetering on the edge of a cliff when rudolph walked in the spies must have called him a paralegal on the lookout or maybe bruce from the elevator perhaps the entire firm was on alert no they were too busy hello mike he said crisply taking a seat crossing his legs setfling in for serious business hi rudy i said i had never called him rudy to his face it was always rudolph his current wife and the partners called him rudy but no one else where have you been he asked without the slightest hint of compassion memphis memphis yeah i needed to see my parents plus the family shrink is there a shrink yes he observed me for a couple of days observed you yeah in one of those swanky little units with persian rugs and salmon for dinner a thousand bucks a day for two days you were in for two days yeah the lying didnt bother me nor did i feel bad because the lying didnt bother me the firm can be harsh even ruthless when it decides to be and i was in no mood for an asschewing from rudolph he had marching orders from the executive committee and he would make a report minutes after leaving my office if i could thaw him the report would go soft the brass would relax life would be easier for the short term you shouldve called somebody he said still hard but the crack was coming come on rudolph i was locked down no phones there was just enough agony in my voice to soften him after a long pause he said are you okay im fine youre fine the shrink said im fine one hundred percent a hundred and ten no problems rudolph i needed a little break thats all im fine back at full throttle that was all rudolph wanted he smiled and relaxed and said we have lots of work to do i know i cant wait he practically ran from my office he would go straight to the phone and report that one of the firms many producers was back in the saddle i locked the door and turned off the lights then spent a painful hour covering my desk with papers and scribblings nothing was accomplished but at least i was on the clock when i couldnt stand it any longer i stuffed the phone messages in my pocket and walked out i escaped without getting caught i stopped at a large discount pharmacy on massachusetts and had a delightful shopping spree candy and small toys for the kids soap and toiletries for them all socks and sweatpants in a variety of childrens sizes a large carton of pampers i had never had so much fun spending two hundred dollars and i would spend whatever was necessary to get them into a warm place if it was a motel for a month no problem they would soon become my clients and i would threaten and irangate with a vengeance until they had adequate housing i couldnt wait to sue somebody i parked across from the church much less afraid than i had been the night before but still sufficiently scared wisely i left the care packages in the car if i walked in like santa claus it would start a riot my intentions were to leave there with the family take them to a motel check them in make sure they were bathed and cleaned and disinfected then feed them until they were stuffed see if they needed medical attention maybe take them to get shoes and warm clothes then feed them again i didnt care what it would cost or how long it might take nor did i care if people thought i was just another rich white guy working off a little guilt miss dolly was pleased to see me she said hello and pointed to a pile of vegetables with skins in need of removal first though i checked on ontario and family and couldnt find them they were not in their spot so i roamed through the basement stepping over and around dozens of street people they were not in the sanctuary nor in the balcony i chatted with miss dolly as i peeled potatoes she remembered the family from last night but they had already left when she arrived around nine where would they go i wondered honey these people move they go from kitchen to kitchen shelter to shelter maybe she heard theyre giving out cheese over in brightwood or blankets somewhere she might even have a job at mcdonalds and she leaves the kids with her sister you never know but they dont stay in one place i seriously doubted if ontarios mother had a job but i wasnt about to debate this with miss dolly in her kitchen mordecai arrived as the line was forming for lunch i saw him before he saw me and when our eyes made contact his entire face smiled a new volunteer had sandwich duty mordecai and i worked the serving tables dipping ladles into the pots and pouring the soup into the plastic bowls there was an art to it too much broth and the recipient might glare at you too many vegetables and there would be nothing left but broth mordecai had perfected his technique years ago i suffered a number of glaring looks before i caught on mordecai had a pleasant word for everyone we servedhello good morning how are you nice to see you again some of them smiled back others never looked up as noon approached the doors grew busier and the lines longer more volunteers appeared from nowhere and the kitchen hummed with the pleasant clutter and bang of happy people busy with their work i kept looking for ontario santa claus was waiting and the little fella didnt have a clue we waited until the lines were gone then filled a bowl each the tables were packed so we ate in the kitchen leaning against the sink you remember that diaper you changed last night i asked between bites as if i could forget i havent seen them today he chewed and thought about it for a second they were here when i left this morning what time was that six they were in the corner over there sound asleep where would they go you never know the little boy told me they stayed in a car you talked to him yeah and now you want to find him dont you yeah dont count on it after lunch the sun popped through and the movement began one by one they walked by the serving table took an apple or an orange and left the basement the homeless are also restless mordecai explained as we watched they like to roam around they have rituals and routines favorite places friends on the streets things to do theyll go back to their parks and alleys and dig out from the snow its twenty degrees outside near zero tonight i said theyll be back wait till dark and this place will be hopping again lets take a ride we checked in with miss dolly who excused us for a while mordecais wellused ford taurus was parked next to my lexus that wont last long around here he said pointing at my car if you plan to spend time in this part of town id suggest you trade down i hadnt dreamed of parting with my fabulous car i was almost offended we got into his taurus and slid out of the parking lot within seconds i realized mordecai green was a horrible driver and i attempted to fasten my seat belt it was broken he seemed not to notice we drove the wellplowed streets of northwest washington blocks and sections of boardedup rowhouses past projects so tough ambulance drivers refused to enter past schools with razor wire glistening on top of the chain link into neighborhoods permanently scarred by riots he was an amazing tour guide every inch was his turf every corner had a story every street had a history we passed other shelters and kitchens he knew the cooks and the reverends churches were good or bad with no blurring of the lines they either opened their doors to the homeless or kept them locked he pointed out the law school at howard a place of immense pride for him his legal education had taken five years at night while he worked a fulltime job and a parttime one he showed me a burnedout rowhouse where crack dealers once operated his third son cassius had died on the sidewalk in front of it when we were near his office he asked if it would be all right to stop in for a minute he wanted to check his mail i certainly didnt mind i was just along for the ride it was dim cold and empty he flipped on light switches and began talking there are three of us me sofia mendoza and abraham lebow sofias a social worker but she knows more street law than me and abraham combined i followed him around the cluttered desks used to have seven lawyers crammed in here can you believe it that was when we got federal money for legal services now we dont get a dime thanks to the republicans there are three offices over there three here on my side he was pointing in all directions lots of empty space maybe empty from a lack of personnel but it was hard to walk without tripping over a basket of old files or a stack of dusty law books who owns the building i asked the cohen trust leonard cohen was the founder of a big new york law firm he died in eightysix mustve been a hundred years old he made a ton of money and late in life he decided he didnt want to die with any of it so he spread it around and one of his many creations was a trust to help poverty lawyers assist the homeless thats how this place came to be the trust operates three clinicshere new york and newark i was hired in eightythree became the director in eightyfour all your funding comes from one source practically all last year the trust gave us a hundred and ten thousand dollars year before it was a hundred fifty so we lost a lawyer it gets smaller every year the trust has not been well managed and its now eating the principal i doubt if well be here in five years maybe three cant you raise money oh sure last year we raised nine thousand bucks but it takes time we can practice law or we can raise funds sofia is not good with people abraham is an abrasive ass from new york that leaves just me and my magnetic personality whats the overhead i asked prying but not too worried almost every nonprofit group published an annual report with all the figures two thousand a month after expenses and a small reserve the three of us split eightynine thousand dollars equally sofia considers herself a full partner frankly were afraid to argue with her i took home almost thirty which from what i hear is about average for a poverty lawyer welcome to the street we finally made it to his office and i sat across from him did you forget to pay your heating bill i asked almost shivering probably we dont work much on weekends saves money this place is impossible to heat or cool that thought had never occurred to anyone at drake and sweeney close on weekends save money and marriages and if we keep it too comfortable our clients wont leave so its cold in the winter hot in the summer cuts down on the street traffic you want coffee no thanks im joking you know we wouldnt do anything to discourage the homeless from being here the climate doesnt bother us we figure our clients are cold and hungry so why should we worry about those matters did you feel guilty when you ate breakfast this morning yes he gave me the smile of a wise old man whod seen it all thats very common we used to work with a lot of young lawyers from the big firms pro bono rookies i call them and they would tell me all the time that they lost interest in food at first he patted his ample midsection but youll get over it what did the pro bono rookies do i asked i knew i was moving toward the bait and mordecai knew i knew we sent them into the shelters they met the clients and we supervised file cases for them most of the work is easy it just takes a lawyer on the phone barking at some bureaucrat who wont move food stamps veterans pensions housing subsidies medicaid aid to childrenabout twentyfive percent of our work deals with benefits i listened intently and he could read my mind mordecai began to reel me in you see michael the homeless have no voice no one listens no one cares and they expect no one to help them so when they try to use the phone to get benefits due them they get nowhere they are put on hold permanently their calls are never returned they have no addresses the bureaucrats dont care and so they screw the very people theyre supposed to help a seasoned social worker can at least get the bureaucrats to listen and maybe look at the file and maybe return a phone call but you get a lawyer on the phone barking and raising hell and things happen bureaucrats get motivated papers get processed no address no problem send the check to me ill get it to the client his voice was rising both hands waving through the air on top of everything else mordecai was the consummate storyteller i suspected he was very effective in front of a jury a fimny story he said about a month ago one of my clients went down to the social security office to pick up an application for benefits shouldve been a routine matter hes sixty years old and in constant pain from a crooked back sleep on rocks and park benches for ten years you get back problems he waited in line outside the office for two hours finally got in the door waited another hour made it up to the first desk tried to explain what he wanted and proceeded to get a tongue lashing from a hardass secretary who was having a bad day she even commented on his odor he was humiliated of course and left without his paperwork he called me i made my calls and last wednesday we had a little ceremony down at the social security office i was there along with my client the secretary was there too along with her supervisor her supervisors supervisor the dc office director and a big man from the social security administration the secretary stood in front of my client and read a onepage apology it was real nice touching she then handed me his application for benefits and i got assurances from everybody present that it would receive immediate attention thats justice michael thats what street law is all about dignity the stories rolled on one after the other all ending with the street lawyers as the good guys the homeless as the victors i knew he had tucked away in his repertoire just as many heartbreaking tales probably more but he was laying the groundwork i lost track of time he never mentioned his mail we finally left and drove back to the shelter it was an hour before dark a good time i thought to get tucked away in the cozy litfie basement before the hoodlums began roaming the streets i caught myself walking slowly and confidently when mordecai was at my side otherwise i wouldve been slashing through the snow bent at the waist my nervous feet barely touching the ground miss dolly had somehow procured a pile of whole chickens and she was laying for me she boiled the birds i picked their steaming flesh mordecais wife joanne joined us for the rush hour she was as pleasant as her husband and almost as tall both sons were six six cassius had been six nine a heavily recruited basketball star when he was shot at the age of seventeen i left at midnight no sign of ontario and his family ten sunday began with a late morning call from claire another stilted chat she initiated only to tell me what time she would be home i suggested we have dinner at our favorite restaurant but she was not in the mood i didnt ask her if anything was wrong we were beyond that since our apartment was on the third floor i had been unable to make satisfactory arrangements to have the sunday post homedelivered we had tried various methods but i never found the paper half the time i showered and dressed in layers the weatherman predicted a high of twentyfive and as i was getting ready to leave the apartment the newsperson ratfled off the mornings top story it stopped me cold i heard the words but they didnt register immediately i walked closer to the tv on the kitchen counter my feet heavy my heart frozen my mouth open in shock and disbelief sometime around pm dc police found a small car near fort totten park in northeast in a war zone it was parked on the street its bald tires stuck in the frozen slush inside were a young mother and her four children all dead from asphyxiation the police suspected the family lived in the car and was trying to stay warm the automobiles tailpipe was buried in a pile of snow plowed from the street a few details but no names i raced to the sidewalk sliding in the snow but staying on my feet then down p street to wisconsin over to thirtyfourth to a newsstand out of breath and horrified i grabbed a paper on the bottom comer of the front page was the story obviously thrown in at the last minute no names yanked open section a dropping the rest of the paper onto the wet sidewalk the story continued on page fourteen with a few standard comments from the police and the predictable warnings about the dangers of clogged tailpipes then the heartbreaking details the mother was twentytwo her name was lontae burton the baby was temeko the toddlers alonzo and dante were twins age two the big brother was ontario age four i must have made a strange sound because a jogger gave me an odd look as if i might be dangerous i began walking away holding the paper open stepping on the other twenty sections excuse me a nasty voice called from behind would you like to pay for that i kept walking he approached from the rear and yelled hey pal i stopped long enough to pull a fivedollar bill from my pocket and throw it at his feet hardly looking at him on p near the apartment i leaned on a brick retaining wall in front of someones splendid rowhouse the sidewalk had been meticulously shoveled i read the story again slowly hoping that somehow the ending would be different thoughts and questions came in torrents and i couldnt keep up with them but two repeated themselves why didnt they return to the shelter and did the baby die wrapped in my denim jacket thinking was burden enough walking was almost impossible after the shock the guilt hit hard why didnt i do something friday night when i first saw them i could have taken them to a warm motel and fed them the phone was ringing when i entered my apartment it was mordecai he asked if id seen the story i asked if he remembered the wet diaper same family i said hed never heard their names i told him more about my encounter with ontario im very sorry michael he said much sadder now so am i i couldnt say much the words wouldnt form so we agreed to meet later i went to the sofa where i remained for an hour without moving then i went to my car and removed the bags of food and toys and clothing id bought for them only because he was curious mordecai came to my office at noon hed been in plenty of big firms in his time but he wanted to see the spot where mister fell i gave him a brief tour with a quick narration of the hostage affair we left in his car i was thankful for the light sunday traffic because mordecai had no interest in what the other cars were doing lontae burtons mother is thirtyeight years old serving a tenyear sentence for selling crack he informed me hed been on the phone two brothers both in jail lontae had a history of prostitution and drugs no idea of who the father or fathers might be whos your source i found her grandmother in a housing project the last time she saw lontae she had only three kids and she was selling drugs with her mother according to the grandmother she cut her ties with her daughter and granddaughter because of the drug business who buries them same people who buried devon hardy how much would a decent funeral cost its negotiable are you interested id like to see them taken care of we were on pennsylvania avenue moving past the mammoth office buildings of congress the capitol in the background and i couldnt help but offer a silent curse or two at the fools who wasted billions each month while people were homeless how could four innocent children die in the streets practically in the shadow of the capitol because they had no place to live they shouldnt have been born some people from my side of town would say the bodies had been taken to the office of the chief medical examiner which also housed the morgue it was a twostory brown aggregate building at dc general hospital they would be held there until claimed if no one came forward within fortyeight hours they would receive a mandatory embalming be placed in wooden caskets and quickly buried in the cemetery near rfk mordecai parked in a handicapped space paused for a second and said are you sure you want to go in i think so hed been there before and he had called ahead a security guard in an illfitting uniform dared to stop us and mordecai snapped so loud it scared me my stomach was in knots anyway the guard retreated happy to get away from us a set of plateglass doors had the word morgue painted in black mordecai entered as if he owned the place im mordecai green attorney for the burton family he growled at the young man behind the desk it was more of a challenge than an announcement the young man checked a clipboard then fumbled with some more papers what the hell are you doing mordecai snapped again the young man looked up with an attitude and then realized how large his adversary really was just a minute he said and went to his computer mordecai turned to me and said loudly youd think they have a thousand dead bodies in there i realized that he had no patience whatsoever with bureaucrats and government workers and i remembered his story about the apology from the social securety secretary for mordecai half of the practice of law was bullying and barking a pale gentleman with badly dyed black hair and a clammy handshake appeared and introduced himself as bill he wore a blue lab jacket and shoes with thick rubber soles where do they find people to work in a morgue we followed him through a door down a sterile hallway where the temperature began dropping and finally to the main holding room how many you got today mordecai asked as if he stopped by all the time to count bodies bill turned the doorknob and said twelve you okay mordecai asked me i dont know bill pushed the metal door and we stepped in the air was frigid the smell antiseptic the floor was white tile the lighting blue fluorescent i followed mordecai my head down trying not to look around but it was impossible the bodies were covered from head to ankle with white sheets just like you see on television we passed a set of white feet a tag around a toe then some brown ones we turned and stopped in a corner a gurney to the left a table to the right bill said lontae burton and dramatically pulled the sheet down to her waist it was ontarios mother all right in a plain white gown death had left no marks on her face she couldve been sleeping i couldnt stop staring at her thats her mordecai said as if hed known her for years he looked at me for verification and i managed a nod bill wheeled around and i held my breath only one sheet covered the children they were lying in a perfect row tucked closely together hands folded over their matching gowns cherubs sleeping little street soldiers finally at peace i wanted to touch ontario to pat him on the arm and tell him i was sorry i wanted to wake him up take him home feed him and give him everything he could ever want i took a step forward for a closer look dont touch bill said when i nodded mordecai said thats them as bill covered them i closed my eyes and said a short prayer one of mercy and forgiveness dont let it happen again the lord said to me in a room down the hall bill pulled out two large wire baskets containing the personal effects of the family he dumped them on a table and we helped him inventory the contents the clothing they wore was dirty and threadbare my denim jacket was the nicest item they owned there were three blankets a purse some cheap toys baby formula a towel more dirty clothes a box of vanilla wafers an unopened can of beer some cigarettes two condoms and about twenty dollars in bills and change the car is at the city lot bill said they say its full of junk well take care of it mordecai said we signed the inventory sheets and left with the personal assets of the lontae burton family what do we do with this stuff i asked take it to the grandmother do you want your coat back no the funeral parlor was owned by a minister mordecai knew he didnt like him because the reverends church was not friendly enough to the homeless but he could deal with him we parked in front of the church on georgia avenue near howard university a cleaner part of town without as many boards over windows its best if you stay here he said i can talk to him a lot plainer if were alone i didnt want to sit in the car by myself but by then i trusted him with my life anyway sure i said sinking a few inches and glancing around youll be all right he left and i locked the doors after a few minutes i relaxed and began to think mordecai wanted to be alone with the minister for business reasons my presence wouldve complicated matters who was i and what was my interest in the family the price would rise immediately the sidewalk was busy i watched the people scurry by the wind cutting them sharply a mother with two children passed me bundled in nice clothing all holding hands where were they last night when ontario and family were huddled in the frigid car breathing the odorless carbon monoxide until they floated away where were the rest of us the world was shutting down nothing made sense in less than a week i had seen six dead street people and i was illequipped to handle the shock i was an educated white lawyer well fed and affluent on the fast track to serious wealth and all the wonderful things it would buy sure the marriage was over but i would bounce back there were plenty of fine women out there i had no serious worries i cursed mister for derailing my life i cursed mordecai for making me feel guilty and ontario for breaking my heart a knock on the window jolted me my nerves were shot to hell anyway it was mordecai standing in the snow next to the curb i cracked the window he says hell do it for two thousand bucks all five whatever i said and he disappeared moments later he was back behind the wheel and speeding away the funeral will be wednesday here at the church wooden caskets but nice ones hell get some flowers you know make it look nice he wanted three thousand but i convinced him that there would be some press so he might get himself on television he liked that two thousand isnt bad thanks mordecai are you okay no we said little as we drove back to my office claires younger brother james had been diagnosed with hodgkins diseasethus the family summit in providence it had nothing to do with me i listened to her talk about the weekend the shock of the news the tears and prayers as they leaned on each other and comforted james and his wife hers is a family of huggers and criers and i was thrilled she had not called me to come up the treatment would start immediately the prognosis was good she was happy to be home and relieved to have someone to unload on we sipped wine in the den by the fire a quilt over our feet it was almost romantic though i was too scarred to even think of being sentimental i made a valiant effort at hearing her words grieving appropriately for poor james interjecting fitting little phrases this was not what i had expected and i wasnt sure if it was what i wanted i thought we might shadowbox perhaps even skirmish soon it had to get ugly then hopefully turn civil as we handled our separation like real adults but after ontario i was not prepared to deal with any issue involving emotion i was drained she kept telling me how tired i looked i almost thanked her i listened hard until she finished then the conversation slowly drifted to me and my weekend i told her everythingmy new life as a volunteer in the shelters then ontario and his family i showed her the story in the paper she was genuinely moved but also puzzled i was not the same person id been a week earlier and she was not sure she liked the latest version any better than the old i was not sure either eleven as young workaholics claire and i did not need alarm clocks especially for monday mornings when we faced an entire week of challenges we were up at five eating cereal at fivethirty then off in separate directions practically racing to see who could leave first because of the wine i had managed to sleep without being haunted by the nightmare of the weekend and as i drove to the office i was determined to place some distance between myself and the street people i would endure the funeral i would somehow find the time to do pro bono work for the homeless i would pursue my friendship with mordecai probably even become a regular in his office i would drop in occasionally on miss dolly and help her feed the hungry i would give money and help raise more of it for the poor certainly i could be more valuable as a source of funds than as another poverty lawyer driving in the dark to the office i decided that i needed a string of eighteenhour days to readjust my priorities my career had suffered a minor derailment an orgy of work would straighten things out only a fool would jump away from the gravy train i was riding i chose a different elevator from misters he was history i shut him out of my mind i did not look at the conference room where he died i threw my briefcase and coat on a chair in my office and went for coffee bouncing down the hallway before six in the morning speaking to a colleague here a clerk there removing my jacket rolling up my sleeves it was great to be back i scanned the wall street journal first partly because i knew it would have nothing to do with dying street people in dc then the post on the front page of the metro section there was a small story about lontae burtons family with a photo of her grandmother weeping outside an apartment building i read it then put it aside i knew more than the reporter and i was determined not to be distracted under the post was a plain manila legalsized file the kind our firm used by the millions it was unmarked and that made it suspicious it was just lying there ex posed on the center of my desk placed there by some anonymous person i opened it slowly there were only two sheets of paper inside the first was a copy of yesterdays story in the post the same one id read ten times and shown to claire last night under it was a copy of something lifted from an official drake and sweeney file the heading read evicteesriveroakstag inc the lefthand column contained the numbers one through seventeen number four was devon hardy number fifteen read lontae burton and three or four children i slowly laid the file on the desk stood and walked to the door locked it then leaned on it the first couple of minutes passed in absolute silence i stared at the file in tile center of the desk i had to assume it was true and accurate why would anyone fabricate such a thing then i picked it up again carefully under the second sheet of paper on the inside of the file itself my anonymous informant had scribbled with a pencil the eviction was legally and ethically wrong it was printed in block letters in an effort to avoid detection should i have it analyzed the markings were faint the lead hardly touching the file i kept the door locked for an hour during which time i took tums standing at the window watching the sunrise and sitting at my desk staring at the file the traffic increased in the hallway and then i heard pollys voice i unlocked the door greeted her as if everything was swell and proceeded to go through the motions the morning was packed with meetings and conferences two of them with rudolph and clients i performed adequately though i couldnt remember anything we said or did rudolph was so proud to have his star back at full throttle i was almost rude to those who wanted to chat about the hostage crisis and its aftershocks i appeared to be the same and i was my usual hardcharging self so the concerns about my stability vanished late in the morning my father called i could not remember the last time hed called me at the office he said it was raining in memphis he was sitting around the house bored and well he and my mother were worried about me claire was fine i explained then to find safe ground i told him about her brother james a person he had met once at the wedding i sounded properly concerned about claires family and that pleased him dad was just happy to reach me at the office i was still there making the big money going after more he asked me to keep in touch half an hour later my brother warner called from his office high above downtown atlanta he was six years older a partner in another megafirm a noholdsbarred litigator because of the age difference warner and i had never been close as kids but we enjoyed each others company during his divorce three years earlier he had confided in me weekly he was on the clock same as i so i knew the conversation would be brief talked to dad he said he told me everything im sure he did i understand how you feel we all go through it you work hard make the big money never stop to help the little people then something happens and you think back to law school back to the first year when we were full of ideals and wanted to use our law degrees to save humanity remember that yes a long time ago right during my first year of law school they took a survey over half my class wanted to do public interest law when we graduated three years later everybody went for the money i dont know what happened law school makes you greedy i suppose our firm has a program where you can take a year off sort of a sabbatical and do public interest law after twelve months you return as if you never left you guys do anything like that vintage warner i had a problem he already had the solution nice and neat twelve months im a new man a quick detour but my future is secure not for associates i said tve heard of a partner or two leaving to work for this administration or that one then returning after a couple of years but never an associate but your circumstances are different youve been traumatized damned near killed simply because you were a member of the firm id throw my weight around some tell em you need time off take a year then get your ass back to the office it might work i said trying to placate him he was a type a personality pushy as hell always one word away from an argument especially with the family i gotta run said so did he we promised to talk more later lunch was with rudolph and a client at a splendid restaurant it was called a working lunch which meant we abstained from alcohol which also meant we would bill the client for the time rudolph went for four hundred an hour me for three hundred we worked and ate for two hours so the lunch cost the client fourteen hundred dollars our firm had an account with the restaurant so it would be billed to drake and sweeney and somewhere along the way our bean counters in the basement would find a way to bill the client for the cost of the food as well the afternoon was nonstop calls and conferences through sheer willpower i kept my game face and got through it billing heavily as i went antitrust law had never seemed so hopelessly dense and boring it was almost five before i found a few minutes alone i said goodbye to polly and locked the door again i opened the mysterious file and began making random notes on a legal pad scribblings and flowcharts with arrows striking riveroaks and drake and sweeney from all directions braden chance the real estate partner id confronted about the file took most of the shots for the firm my principal suspect was his paralegal the young man who had heard our sharp words and who seconds later had referred to chance as an ass when i was leaving their suite he would know the details of the eviction and he would have access to the file with a pocket phone to avoid any dands records i called a paralegal in antitrust his office was around the corner from mine he referred me to another and with little effort i learned that the guy i wanted was hector palma hed been with the firm about three years all in real estate i planned to track him down but outside the office mordecai called he inquired about my dinner plans for the evening ill treat he said soup he laughed of course not i know an excellent place we agreed to meet at seven claire was back in her surgeons mode oblivious to time meals or husband she had checked in midafternoon just a quick word on the run had no idea when she might be home but very late for dinner every man for himself i didnt hold it against her she had learned the fasttrack lifestyle from me we met at a restaurant near dupont circle the bar at the front was packed with wellpaid government types having a drink before fleeing the city we had a drink in the back in a tight booth the burton story is big and getting bigger he said sipping a draft beer im sorry ive been in a cave for the past twelve hours whats happened lots of press four dead kids and their momma living in a car they find them a mile from capitol hill where theyre in the process of reforming welfare to send more mothers into the streets its beautiful so the funeral should be quite a show no doubt ive talked to a dozen homeless activists today theyll be there and theyre planning to bring their people with them the place will be packed with street people again lots of press four little coffins next to their mothers cameras catching it all for the six oclock news were having a rally before and a march afterward maybe something good will come from their deaths maybe as a seasoned bigcity lawyer i knew there was a purpose behind every lunch and dinner invitation mordecai had something on his mind i could tell by the way his eyes followed nfine any idea why they were homeless i asked fishing no probably the usual i havent had time to ask questions driving over i had decided that i could not tell him about the mysterious file and its contents it was confidential known to me only because of my position at drake and sweeney to reveal what i had learned about the activities of a client would be an egregious breach of professional responsibility the thought of divulging it scared me plus i had not verified anything the waiter brought salads and we began eating we had a firm meeting this afternoon mordecai said between bites me abraham sofia we need some help i was not surprised to hear that what kind of help another lawyer i thought you were broke we keep a little reserve and weve adopted a new marketing strategy the idea of the th street legal clinic worried about a marketing strategy was humorous and that was what he intended we both smiled if we could get the new lawyer to spend ten hours a week raising money then he could afford himself another series of smiles he continued as much as we hate to admit it our survival will depend on our ability to raise money the cohen trust is declining weve had the luxury of not begging but now its gotta change whats the rest of the job street law youve had a good dose of it youve seen our place its a dump sofias a shrew abrahams an ass the clients smell bad and the money is a joke how much money we can offer you thirty thousand a year but we can only promise you half of it for the first six months why the trust closes its books june thirtieth at which time theyll tell us how much we get for the next fiscal year beginning july first we have enough in reserve to pay you for the next six months after that the four of us will split whats left after expenses abraham and sofia agreed to this yep after a little speech by me we figure you have good contacts within the established bar and since youre well educated nicelooking bright and all that crap you should be a natural at raising money what if i dont want to raise money then the four of us could lower our salaries even more perhaps go to twenty thousand a year then to fifteen and when the trust dries up we could hit the streets just like our clients homeless lawyers so im the future of the th street legal clinic thats what we decided well take you in as a full partner lets see drake and sweeney top that im touched i said i was also a bit frightened the job offer was not unexpected but its arrival opened a door i was hesitant to walk through black bean soup arrived and we ordered more beer whats abrahams story i asked jewish kid from brooklyn came to washington to work on senator moynihans staff spent a few years on the hill landed on the street extremely bright he spends most of his time coordinating litigation with pro bono lawyers from big firms right now hes suing the census bureau to be certain the homeless get counted and hes suing the dc school system to make sure homeless kids get an education his people skills leave a lot to be desired but hes great in the back room plotting litigation and sofia a career social worker whos been taking night classes in law school for eleven years she acts and thinks like a lawyer especially when shes abusing government workers youll hear her say this is sofia mendoza attorneyatlaw ten times a day shes also the secretary nope we dont have secretaries you do your own typing filing coffee making he leaned forward a few inches and lowered his voice the three of us have been together for a long time michael and weve carved out little niches to be honest we need a fresh face with some new ideas the money is certainly appealing i said a weak effort at humor he grinned anyway you dont do it for the money you do it for your soul my soul kept me awake most of the night did i have the guts to walk away was i seriously considering taking a job which paid so little i was literally saying goodbye to millions the things and possessions i longed for would become fading memories the timing wasnt bad with the marriage over it somehow seemed fitting that i make drastic changes on all fronts twelve i called in sick tuesday probably the flu i told polly who as she was trained to do wanted specifics fever sore throat headaches all of the above any and all i didnt care one had better be completely sick to miss work at the firm she would do a form and send it to rudolph anticipating his call i left the apartment and wandered around georgetown during the early morning the snow was melting fast the high would be in the fifties i killed an hour loitering along washington harbor sampling cappuccino from a number of vendors watching the rowers freeze on the potomac at ten i left for the funeral the sidewalk in front of the church was barricaded cops were standing around their motorcycles parked on the street farther down were the television vails a large crowd was listening to a speaker yell into a microphone as i drove by there were a few hastily painted placards held above heads for the benefit of the cameras i parked on a side street three blocks away and hurried toward the church i avoided the front by heading for a side door which was being guarded by an elderly usher i asked if there was a balcony he asked if i was a reporter he took me inside and pointed to a door i thanked him and went through it then up a flight of shaky stairs until i emerged on the balcony overlooking a beautiful sanctuary below the carpet was burgundy the pews dark wood the windows stained and clean it was a very handsome church and for a second i could understand why the reverend was reluctant to open it to the homeless i was alone with my choice of seating i walked quietly to a spot above the rear door with a direct view down the center aisle to the pulpit a choir began singing outside on the front steps and i sat in the tranquillity of the empty church the music drifting in the music stopped the doors opened the stampede began the balcony floor shook as the mourners poured into the sanctuary the choir took its place behind the pulpit the reverend directed trafficthe tv crews in one corner the small family in the front pew the activists and their homeless down the center section mordecai ambled in with two people i didnt know a door to one side opened and the prisoners marched outlontaes mother and two brothers clad in blue prison garb cuffed at the wrists and ankles chained together and escorted by four armed guards they were placed in the second pew center aisle behind the grandmother and some other relatives when things were still the organ began low and sad there was a racket under me and all heads turned around the reverend assumed the pulpit and instructed us to stand ushers with white gloves rolled the wooden coffins down the aisle and lined them end to end across the front of the church with lontaes in the center the babys was tiny less than three feet long ontarios alonzos and dantes were midsized it was an appalling sight and the wailing began the choir started to hum and sway the ushers arranged flowers around the caskets and i thought for one horrifying second they were going to open them i had never been to a black funeral before i had no idea what to expect but i had seen news clips from other funerals in which the casket was sometimes opened the family kissing the corpse the vultures with the cameras were ever ready but the caskets remained closed and so the world didnt learn what i knewthat ontario and family looked very much at peace we sat down and the reverend served up a lengthy prayer then a solo from sister somebody then moments of silence the reverend read scripture and preached for a bit he was followed by a homeless activist who delivered a scathing attack on a society and its leaders who allowed such a thing to happen she blamed congress especially the republicans and she blamed the city for its lack of leadership and the courts and the bureaucracy but she saved her harshest diatribe for the upper classes those with money and power who didnt care for the poor and the sick she was articulate and angry very effective i thought but not exactly at home at a funeral they clapped for her when she finished the reverend then spent a very long time blasting everyone who wasnt of color and had money a solo some more scripture then the choir launched into a soulful hymn that made me want to cry a procession formed to lay hands upon the dead but it quickly broke down as the mourners began wailing and rubbing the caskets open them up someone screamed but the reverend shook his head no they bunched toward the pulpit crowding around the caskets yelling and sobbing as the choir cranked it up several notches the grandmother was the loudest and she was stroked and soothed by the others i couldnt believe it where were these people during the last months of lontaes life those little bodies lying up there in boxes had never known so much love the cameras inched closer as more and more mourners broke down it was more of a show than anything else the reverend finally stepped in and restored order he prayed again with organ music in the background when he finished a long dismissal began as the people paraded by the caskets one last time the service lasted an hour and a half for two thousand bucks it wasnt a bad production i was proud of it they rallied again outside and began a march in the general direction of capitol hill mordecai was in the middle of it and as they disappeared around a corner i wondered how many marches and demonstrations he had been in not enough he would probably answer rudolph mayes had become a partner at drake and sweeney at the age of thirty still a record and if life continued as he planned he would one day be the oldest working partner the law was his life as his three former wives could attest everything else he touched was disastrous but rudolph was the consummate bigfirm team player he was waiting for me at pm in his office behind a pile of work polly and the secretaries were gone as were most of the paralegals and clerks the hall traffic slowed considerably after fivethirty i closed the door sat down thought you were sick he said im leaving rudolph i said as boldly as i could but my stomach was in knots he shoved books out of the way and put the cap on his expensive pen im listening im leaving the firm i have an offer to work for a public interest firm dont be stupid michael im not being stupid ive made up my mind and i want out of here with as little trouble as possible youll be a partner in three years ive found a better deal than that he couldnt think of a response so he rolled his eyes in frustration come on mike you cant crack up over one incident im not cracking up rudolph im simply moving into another field none of the other eight hostages are doing this good for them if theyre happy then im happy for them besides theyre in litigation a strange breed where are you going a legal clinic near logan circle it specializes in homeless law homeless law yep how much are they paying you a bloody fortune wanna make a donation to the clinic youre losing your mind just a little crisis rudolph im only thirtytwo too young for the midlife crazies i figure ill get mine over with early take a month off go work with the homeless get it out of your system then come back this is a terrible time to leave mike you know how far behind we are wont work rudolph its no fun if theres a safety net fun youre doing this for fun absolutely think how much fun it would be to work without looking at a time clock what about claire he asked revealing the depths of his desperation he hardly knew her and he was the least qualified person in the firm to dispense marital advice shes okay i said id like to leave friday he grunted in defeat he closed his eyes slowly shook his head i dont believe this im sorry rudolph we shook hands and promised to meet for an early breakfast to discuss my unfinished work i didnt want polly to hear it secondhand so i went to my office and called her she was at home in arlington cooking dinner it ruined her week i picked up thai food and took it home i chilled some wine fixed the table and began rehearsing my lines if claire suspected an ambush it wasnt evident over the years we had developed the habit of simply ignoring each other as opposed to fighting therefore our tactics were unrefined but i liked the idea of a blindside of being thoroughly prepared with the shock then ready with the quips i thought it would be nice and unfair completely acceptable within the confines of a crumbling marriage it was almost ten she had eaten on the run hours earlier so we went straight to the den with glasses of wine i stoked the fire and we settled into our favorite chairs after a few minutes i said we need to talk what is it she asked completely unworried im thinking of leaving drake and sweeney oh really she took a drink i admired her coolness she either expected this or wanted to seem unconcerned yes i cant go back there why not im ready for a change the corporate work is suddenly boring and unimportant and i want to do something to help people thats nice she was already thinking about the money and i was anxious to see how long it would take to get around to it in fact thats very admirable michael i told you about mordecai green his clinic has offered me a job im starting monday monday yes so youve made your decision already yes without any discussion with me i have no say in the matter is that right i cant go back to the firm claire i told rudolph today another sip a slight grinding of file teeth a flash of anger but she let it pass her selfcontrol was amazing we watched the fire hypnotized by the orange flames she spoke next can i ask what this does for us financially it changes things how much is the new salary thirty thousand a year thirty thousand a year she repeated then she said it again somehow making it sound even lower thats less than what i make her salary was thirtyone thousand a figure that would increase dramatically in the years to comeserious money was not far away for purposes of the discussion i planned to have no sympathy for any whining about money you dont do public interest law for the money i said trying not to sound pious as i recall you didnt go to med school for the money like every med student in the country she had begun her studies vowing that money was not the attraction she wanted to help humanity same for law students we all lied she watched the fire and did the math i guessed she was probably thinking about the rent it was a very nice apartment at twentyfour hundred a month it shouldve been even nicer the furnishings were adequate we were proud of where we livedright address beautiful rowhouse swanky neighborhoodbut we spent so little time there and we seldom entertained moving would be an adjustment but we could endure it we had always been open about our finances nothing was hidden she knew we had around fiftyone thousand dollars in mutual funds and twelve thousand in the checking account i was amazed at how little wed saved in six years of marriage when youre on the fast track at a big firm the money seems endless i guess well have to make adjustments wont we she said staring coldly at me the word adjustments was dripping with connotations i suppose so im tired she said she drained her glass and went to the bedroom how pathetic i thought we couldnt even muster enough rancor to have a decent fight of course i fully realized my new status in life i was a wonderful storyambitious young lawyer transformed into an advocate for the poor turns back on bluechip firm to work for nothing even though she thought i was losing my mind claire had found it hard to criticize a saint i put a log on the fire fixed another drink and slept on the sofa thirteen the partners had a private dining room on the eighth floor and it was supposed to be an honor for an associate to eat there rudolph was the sort of klutz who would think that a bowl of irish oatmeal at am in their special room would help return me to my senses how could i turn my back on a future filled with power breakfasts he had exciting news hed spoken with arthur late the night before and there was in the works a proposal to grant me a twelvemonth sabbatical the firm would supplement whatever salary the clinic paid it was a worthy cause they should do more to protect the rights of the poor i would be treated as the firms designated pro bono boy for an entire year and they could all feel good about themselves i would return with my batteries recharged my other interests quelled my talents once again directed to the glory of drake and sweeney i was impressed and touched by the idea and i could not simply dismiss it i promised him i would think about it and quickly he cautioned that it would have to be approved by the executive committee since i was not a partner the firm had never considered such a leave for an associate rudolph was desperate for me to stay and it had little to do with friendship our antitrust division was logjammed with work and we needed at least two more senior associates with my experience it was a terrible time for me to leave but i didnt care the firm had eight hundred lawyers they would find the bodies they needed the year before i had billed just under seven hundred fifty thousand dollars that was why i was eating breakfast in their fancy little room and listening to their urgent plans to keep me it also made sense to take my annual salary throw it at the homeless or any charity i wished for that matter then entice me back after one year once he finished with the idea of the sabbatical we proceeded to review the most pressing matters in my office we were listing things to do when braden chance sat at a table not far from ours he didnt see me at first there were a dozen or so partners eating most alone most deep in the morning papers i tried to ignore him but i finally looked over and caught him glaring at me good morning braden i said loudly startling him and causing rudolph to jerk around to see who it was chance nodded said nothing and suddenly became involved with some toast you know him rudolph asked under his breath weve met i said during our brief encounter in his office chance had demanded the name of my supervising partner id given him rudolphs name it was obvious he had not lodged any complaints an ass rudolph said barely audible it was unanimous he flipped a page immediately forgot about chance and plowed ahead there was a lot of unfinished work in my office i found myself thinking of chance and the eviction file he had a soft look with pale skin delicate features a fragile manner i could not imagine him in the streets examining abandoned warehouses filled with squatters actually getting his hands dirty to make sure his work was thorough of course he never did that he had paralegals chance sat at his desk and supervised the paperwork billing several hundred an hour while the hector palmas of the firm took care of the nasty details chance had lunch and played golf with the executives of riveroaks that was his role as a partner he probably didnt know the names of the people evicted from the riveroakstag warehouse and why should he they were just squatters nameless faceless homeless he wasnt there with the cops when they were dragged from their little dwellings and thrown into the streets but hector palma probably saw it happen and if chance didnt know the names of lontae burton and family then he couldnt make the connection between the eviction and their deaths or maybe he did know now maybe someone had told him these questions would have to be answered by hector palma and soon it was wednesday i was leaving on friday rudolph wrapped up our breakfast at eight just in time for another meeting in his office with some very important people i went to my desk and read the post there was a gutwrenching photo of the five unopened caskets in the sanctuary and a thorough review of the service and the march afterward there was also an editorial a wellwritten challenge to all of us with food and roofs to stop and think about the lontae burtons of our city they were not going away they could not be swept from the streets and deposited in some hidden place so we didnt have to see them they were living in cars squatting in shacks freezing in makeshift tents sleeping on park benches waiting for beds in crowded and sometimes dangerous shelters we shared the same city they were a part of our society if we didnt help them they would multiply in numbers and they would continue to die in our streets i cut the editorial from the paper folded it and placed it in my wallet through the paralegal network i made contact with hector palma it would not be wise to approach him directly chance was probably lurking nearby we met in the main library on the third floor between stacks of books away from security cameras and anybody else he was extremely nervous did you put that file on my desk i asked him pointblank there was little time for games what file he asked cutting his eyes around as if gunmen were tracking us the riveroakstag eviction you handled it right he didnt know how much i knew or how little yeah he said wheres the file he pulled a book off the shelf and acted as though he were deep in research chance keeps all the files in his office yes locked in a file cabinet we were practically whispering i had not been nervous about the meeting but i caught myself glancing around anybody watching would have immediately known that we were up to something whats in the file i asked bad stuff tell me i have a wife and four kids im not about to get fired you have my word youre leaving what do you care word traveled fast but i was not surprised i often wondered who gossiped more the lawyers or their secretaries probably the paralegals why did you put that file on my desk i asked he reached for another book his right hand literally shaking i dont know what youre talking about he flipped a few pages then walked to the end of the row i followed along certain no one was anywhere near us he stopped and found another book he still wanted to talk i need that file i said i dont have it then how can i get it youll have to steal it fine where do i get a key he studied my face for a moment trying to decide how serious i was i dont have a key he said howd you get the list of evictees i dont know what youre talking about yes you do you put it on my desk youre as crazy as hell he said and walked away i waited for him to stop but he kept going past the rows of shelves past the stacked tiers past the front desk and out of the library i had no intention of busting my ass my last three days at the firm regardless of what id led rudolph to believe instead i covered my desk with antitrust litter shut the door stared at the walls and smiled at all the things i was leaving behind the pressure was lifting with every breath no more labor with a time clock wrapped around my throat no more eightyhour weeks because my ambitious colleagues might be doing eightyfive no more brownnosing those above me no more nightmares about getting the partnership door slammed in my face i called mordecai and formally accepted the job he laughed and joked about finding a way to pay me i would start monday but he wanted me to stop by earlier for a brief orientation i pictured the interior of the th street legal clinic and wondered which of the empty cluttered offices i would be assigned as if it mattered by late afternoon i was spending most of my time accepting grave farewells from friends and colleagues convinced i had truly lost my mind i took it well after all i was approaching sainthood meanwhile my wife was visiting a divorce hater a female one with the reputation of being a merciless ballsqueezer claire was waiting for me when i arrived home at six rather early the kitchen table was covered with notes and computer spreadsheets a calculator sat ready she was icy and well prepared this time i walked into the ambush i suggest we get a divorce on the grounds of unreconcilable differences she began pleasantly we dont fight we dont point fingers we admit what we have been unable to saythe marriage is over she stopped and waited for me to say something i couldnt act surprised her mind was made up what good would it do to object i had to seem as coldblooded as she sure i said trying to be as nonchalant as possible there was an element of relief in finally being honest but it did bother me that she wanted the divorce more than i did to keep the upper hand she then mentioned her meeting with jacqueline hume her new divorce lawyer dropping the name as if it were a mortar round then relaying for my benefit the selfserving opinions her mouthpiece had delivered why did you hire a lawyer i asked interrupting i want to make sure im protected and you think i would take advantage of you youre a lawyer i want a lawyer its that simple you couldve saved a lot of money by not hiring her i said trying to be a little contentious after all this was a divorce but i feel much better now that i have she handed me exhibit a a worksheet of our assets and liabilities exhibit b was a proposed split of these not surprisingly she intended to get the majority we had cash of twelve thousand dollars and she wanted to use half of it to pay off the bank loan on her car i would get twentyfive hundred of the remainder no mention of paying off the sixteen thousand owed on my lexus she wanted forty thousand of the fiftyone thousand dollars we had in mutual funds i got to keep my k not exactly an even split i said its not going to be equal she said with all the confidence of one who had just hired a pit bull why not because im not the one going through a midlife crisis so its my fault were not assigning fault were dividing the assets for reasons known only to you youve decided to take a cut in pay of ninety thousand dollars a year why should i suffer the consequences my lawyer is confident she can convince a judge that your actions have wrecked us financially you want to go crazy fine but dont expect me to starve small chance of that im not going to bicker i wouldnt either if i were getting everything i felt compelled to cause some measure of trouble we couldnt scream and throw things we damned sure werent going to cry we couldnt make nasty accusations about affairs or chemical addictions what kind of divorce was this a very sterile one she ignored me and continued down her list of notes one no doubt prepared by the mouthpiece the aparunent lease is up june thirtieth and ill stay here until then thats ten thousand in rent when would you like me to leave as soon as youd like fine if she wanted me out i wasnt about to beg to stay it was an exercise in oneupsmanship which side of the table could show more disdain than the other i almost said something stupid like you got someone else moving in i wanted to rattle her to watch her do an instant thaw instead i kept my cool ill be gone by the weekend i said she had no response but she didnt frown why do you think youre entitled to eighty percent of the mutual funds i asked im not getting eighty percent ill spend ten thousand in rent another three thousand in utilities two thousand to pay off our joint credit cards and well owe about six thousand in taxes incurred together thats a total of twentyone thousand exhibit c was a thorough list of the personal property beginning with the den and ending in the empty bedroom neither of us would dare fall into a squabble over pots and pans so the division was quite amicable take what you want i said several times especially when addressing items such as towels and bed linens we traded a few things doing it with finesse my position on several assets was driven more by a reluctance to physically move them than by any pride of ownership i wanted a television and some dishes bachelorhood had been sprung suddenly upon me and i had trouble contemplating the furnishing of a new place she on the other hand had spent hours living in the future but she was fair we finished the drudgery of exhibit c and declared ourselves to be equitably divided we would sign a separation agreement wait six months then go to court together and legally dissolve our union neither of us wanted any postgame chat i found my overcoat and went for a long walk through the streets of georgetown wondering how life had changed so dramatically the erosion of the marriage had been slow but certain the change in careers had hit like a bullet things were moving much too fast but i was unable to stop them fourteen the sabbatical concept was killed in the executive committee while no one was supposed to know what that group did in its private meetings it was reported to me by a very somber rudolph that a bad precedent could be set with a firm so large granting a years leave to one associate might trigger all sorts of requests from other malcontents there would be no safety net the door would slam when i walked through it are you sure you know what youre doing he asked standing before my desk there were two large storage boxes on the floor next to him polly was already packing my junk im sure i said with a smile dont worry about me i tried thanks rudolph he left shaking his head after claires blindside the night before i had not been able to think about the sabbatical more urgent thoughts cluttered my brain i was about to be divorced and single and homeless myself suddenly i was concerned with a new apartment not to mention a new job and office and career i closed the door and scanned the real estate section of the classifieds i would sell the car and get rid of the fourhundredeightydollaramonth payment id buy a clunker insure it heavily and wait for it to disappear into the darkness of my new neighborhoods if i wanted a decent apartment in the district it became apparent that most of my new salary would go for rent i left early for lunch and spent two hours racing around central washington looking at lofts the cheapest was a dump for eleven hundred a month much too much for a street lawyer another file awaited me upon my return from lunch another plain manila legalsized one with no writing on the outside of it same spot on my desk inside two keys were taped to the left side a typed note was stapled to the right it read top key is to chances door bottom key is to file drawer under window copy and return careful chance is very suspicious lose the keys polly appeared instantly as she so often did no knock not a sound just a sudden ghostlike presence in the room she was pouting and ignoring me wed been together for four years and she claimed to be devastated by my departure we werent really that close shed be reassigned in days she was a very nice person but the least of my worries i quickly closed the file not knowing if she had seen it i waited for a moment as she busied herself with my storage boxes she didnt mention itstrong evidence that she was unaware of it but since she saw everything in the hallway around my office i couldnt imagine how hector or anyone else could enter and leave without being seen barry nuzzo fellow hostage and friend dropped by to have a serious talk he shut the door and stepped around the boxes i didnt want to discuss my leaving so i told him about claire his wife and claire were both from providence a fact that seemed oddly significant in washington we had socialized with them a few times over the years but the group friendship had gone the way of the marriage he was surprised then saddened then seemed to shake it off quite well youre having a bad month he said im sorry its been a long slide i said we talked about the old days the guys who had come and gone we had not bothered to replay the mister affair over a beer and that struck me as strange two friends face death together walk away from it then get too busy to help each other with the aftermath we eventually got around to it it was difficult to avoid with the storage boxes in the middle of the floor i realized that the incident was the reason for our conversation im sorry i let you down he said come on barry no really i shouldre been here why because its obvious youve lost your mind he said with a laugh i tried to enjoy his humor yeah im a little crazy now i guess but ill get over it no seriously i heard you were having trouble i tried to find you last week but you were gone i was worried about you but ive been in trial you know the usual i know i really feel bad for not being here mike im sorry come on stop it we all got the hell scared out of us but you couldve been hit he couldve killed all of us barry real dynamite a missed shot boom lets not replay it the last thing i saw as we were scrambling out the door was you covered with blood screaming i thought you were hit we got outside in a pile with people grabbing us yelling and i was waiting for the blast i thought mikes still in there and hes hurt we stopped by the elevators somebody cut the ropes from our wrists and i glanced back just in time to see you as the cops grabbed you i remember the blood all that damned blood i didnt say anything he needed this somehow it would ease his mind he could report to rudolph and the others that he had at least tried to talk me out of it all the way down i kept asking did mike get hit did mike get hit no one could answer it seemed like an hour passed before they said you were okay i was going to call you when i got home but the kids wouldnt leave me alone i should have forget it im sorry mike please dont say that again its over done with we couldve talked about it for days and nothing wouldve changed when did you realize you were leaving i had to think about this for a moment the truthful answer was at the point sunday when bill yanked the sheets back and i saw my little pal ontario finally at peace it was then and there at that moment in the city morgue that i became someone else over the weekend i said with no further explanation he didnt need one he shook his head as if the storage boxes were primarily his fault i decided to help him through it you couldnt have stopped me barry no one could then he began nodding in agreement because he understood somehow a gun in your face the clock stops priorities emerge at oncegod family friends money falls to the bottom the firm and the career vanish as each awful second ticks by and you realize this could be the last day of your life how about you i asked how are you doing the firm and the career stay on the bottom for a few short hours we started a trial on thursday in fact we were preparing for it when mister interrupted us we couldnt ask the judge for a continuance because the client had been waiting four years for a trial date and we werent injured you know not physically anyway so we kicked into high gear started the trial and never slowed down the trial saved us of course it did work is therapy even salvation at drake and sweeney i wanted to scream at him because two weeks ago i would have said the same thing good i said how nice so youre okay sure he was a litigator a macho player with teflon skin he also had three kids so the luxury of a thirtysomething detour was out of the question the clock suddenly called him we shook hands embraced and made all the usual promises to keep in touch i kept the door closed so i could stare at the file and decide what to do before long id made a few assumptions one the keys worked two it was not a setup i had no known enemies and i was leaving anyway three the file was really in the office in the drawer under the window four it was possible to get it without being caught five it could be copied in a short period of time six it could then be returned as if nothing had happened seven and the biggest of all it actually contained damning evidence i wrote these down on a legal pad taking the file would be grounds for instant dismissal but i didnt care about that same for getting caught in chances office with an unauthorized key copying it would be the challenge since no file at the firm was less than an inch thick there would probably be a hundred pages to xerox assuming i copied everything i would have to stand in front of a machine for several minutes exposed that would be too dangerous secretaries and clerks did the copying not lawyers the machines were hightech complicated and no doubt just waiting to jam the instant i pushed a button they were also codedbuttons had to be pushed so that every copy could be billed to a client and they were in open areas i couldnt think of a sin gle copier in a corner perhaps i could find one in another section of the firm but my presence there would be suspicious i would have to leave the building with it and that would border on being a criminal act i wouldnt steal the file though just borrow it at four i walked through the real estate section with my sleeves rolled up holding a stack of files as if i had serious business there hector was not at his desk braden chance was in his office with his door cracked his bitchy voice on the phone a secretary smiled at me as i strolled by i saw no security cameras peeking down from above some floors had them others didnt whod want to breach security in real estate i left at five i bought sandwiches at a deli and drove to my new office my partners were still there waiting for me sofia actually smiled as we shook hands but only for an instant welcome aboard abraham said gravely as if i were climbing onto a sinking ship mordecai waved his arms at a small room next to his how about this he said suite e beautiful i said stepping into my new office it was about half the size of the one id just left my desk at the firm wouldnt fit in it there were four file cabinets on one wall each a different color the light was a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling i didnt see a phone i like it i said and i wasnt lying well get you a phone tomorrow he said pulling the shades down over a window ac unit this was last used by a young lawyer named banebridge what happened to him couldnt handle the money it was getting dark and sofia seemed anxious to leave abraham retreated to his office mordecai and i ate dinner at his deskthe sandwiches id brought with the bad coffee hed brewed the copier was a bulky one of eighties vintage free of code panels and the other bells and whistles favored by my former firm it sat in a corner of the main room near one of the four desks covered with old files what time are you leaving tonight i asked mordecai between bites i dont know in an hour i guess why just curious im going back to drake and sweeney for a couple of hours lastminute stuff they want me to finish then id like to bring a load of my office junk here tonight would that be possible he was chewing his food he reached into a drawer pulled out a ring with three keys on it and tossed it to me come and go as you please he said will it be safe no so be careful park right out there as close to the door as you can walk fast then lock yourself in he must have seen the fear in my eyes because he said get used to it be smart i walked fast and smart to my car at sixthirty the sidewalk was empty no hoodlums no gunfire not a scratch on my lexus i felt proud as i unlocked it and drove away maybe i could survive on the streets the drive back to drake and sweeney took eleven minutes if it took thirty minutes to copy chances file then it would be out of his office for about an hour assuming all went well and he would never know i waited until eight then walked casually down to real estate my sleeves rolled up again as if i were hard at work the hallways were deserted i knocked on chances door no answer it was locked i then checked every office knocking softly at first then harder then turning the knob about half were locked around each comer i checked for security cameras i looked in conference rooms and typing pools not a soul the key to his door was just like mine same color and size it worked perfectly and i was suddenly inside a dark office and faced with the decision of whether or not to turn on the lights a person driving by couldnt tell which office was suddenly lit and i doubted if anyone in the hallway could see a ray of light at the bottom of the door plus it was very dark and i didnt have a flashlight i locked the door turned on the lights went straight to the file drawer under the window and unlocked it with the second key on my knees i quietly pulled the drawer out there were dozens of files all relating to riveroaks all arranged neatly according to some method chance and his secretary were well organized a trait our firm cherished a thick one was labeled riveroakstag inc i gently removed it and began to flip through it i wanted to make sure it was the right file a male voice yelled hey in the hallway and i jumped out of my skin another male voice answered from a few doors down and the two struck up a conversation somewhere very near chances door basketball talk bullets and knicks with rubbery knees i walked to the door i turned off the lights listening to their talk then i sat on bradens fine leather sofa for ten minutes if i was seen leaving the office emptyhanded nothing would be done tomorrow was my last day anyway of course i wouldnt have the file either what if someone spotted me leaving with the file if they confronted me i would be dead i pondered the situation furiously getting caught in every scenario be patient i kept telling myself theyll go away basketball was followed by girls neither sounded married probably a couple of derks from georgetowns law school working nights their voices soon faded i locked the drawer in the dark and took the file five minutes six seven eight i quietly opened the door slowly placed my head in the crack and looked up and down the hall no one i scooted out past hectors desk and headed for the reception area walking briskly while trying to appear casual hey someone yelled from behind i turned a corner and glanced back just quickly enough to see a guy coming after me the nearest door was to a small library i ducked inside luckily it was dark i moved between tiers of books until i found another door on the other side i opened it and at the end of a short hallway i saw an exit sign above a door i ran through it figuring i could run faster down the stairs than up them i bounded down even though my office was two floors above if by chance he recognized me he might go there looking for me i emerged on the ground floor out of breath without a coat not wanting to be seen by anyone especially the security person guarding the elevators to keep out any more street people i went to a side exit the same one polly and i had used to avoid the reporters the night mister got shot it was freezing and a light rain was falling as i ran to my car the thoughts of a bungling firsttime thief it was a stupid thing to do very stupid did i get caught no one saw me leave chances office no one knew i had a file that wasnt mine i shouldnt have run when he yelled i shouldre stopped chatted him up acted as if everything were fine and if he wanted to see the file id rebuke him and send him away he was probably just one of the lowly clerks i had heard earlier but why had he yelled like that if he didnt know me why was he trying to stop me from the other end of the hallway i drove onto massachusetts in a hurry to get the copying done and somehow get the file back where it belonged i had pulled allnighters before and if i had to wait until am to sneak back to chances office then i would do so i relaxed a little the heater was blowing at full speed there was no way to know that a drug bust had gone bad a cop had been shot a jaguar owned by a dealer was speeding down eighteenth street i had the green light on new hampshire but the boys who shot the cop werent concerned with the rules of the road the jaguar was a blur to my left then the air bag exploded in my face when i came to the drivers door was pinching my left shoulder black faces were staring in at me through the shattered window i heard sirens then drifted away again one of the paramedics unlatched my seat belt and they pulled me over the console and through the passenger door i dont see any blood someone said can you walk a paramedic asked my shoulder and ribs were hurting i tried to stand but my legs wouldnt work im okay i said sitting on the edge of a stretcher there was a racket behind me but i couldnt turn around they strapped me down and as i entered the ambulance i saw the jaguar upside down and surrounded by cops and medics i kept saying im okay im okay as they checked my blood pressure we were moving the siren faded they took me to the emergency room at george washington university medical center xrays revealed no breaks of any type i was bruised and in terrible pain they filled me with painkillers and rolled me up to a private room i awoke sometime in the night claire was sleeping in a chair next to my bed fifteen she left before dawn a sweet note on the table told me that she had to make her rounds and that she would return midmorning she had talked to my doctors and it was likely that i would not die we seemed perfectly normal and happy a cute couple devoted to each other i drifted off wondering why exactly we were going through the process of a divorce a nurse woke me at seven and handed me the note i read it again as she rattled on about the weathersleet and snowand took my blood pressure i asked her for a newspaper she brought it thirty minutes later with my cereal the story was front page metro the narc was shot several times in a gun battle his condition was critical hed killed one dealer the second dealer was the jaguar driver who died at the scene of the crash under circumstances still to be investigated i was not mentioned which was fine had i not been involved the story would have been an everyday shootout between cops and crack dealers ignored and unread by me welcome to the streets i tried to convince myself it couldve happened to any dc professional but it was a hard sell to be in that part of town after dark was to ask for trouble my upper left arm was swollen and already turning bluethe left shoulder and collarbone stiff and tender to the touch my ribs were sore to the point of keeping me perfectly still they hurt only when i breathed i made it to the bathroom where i relieved myself and looked at my face an air bag is a small bomb the impact stuns the face and chest but the damage was minimal slightly swollen nose and eyes an upper lip that had a new shape nothing that wouldnt disappear over the weekend the nurse was back with more pills i made her identify each one then i said no to the entire collection they were for pain and stiffness and i wanted a clear head the doc popped in at seventhirty for a quick goingover with nothing broken or tipped my hours as a patient were numbered he suggested another round of xrays to be safe i tried to say no but he had already discussed file matter with my wife so i limped around my room for an eternity testing my wounded body parts watching the morning newsbabble hoping no one i knew would suddenly enter and see me in my yellow paisley gown finding a wrecked car in the district is a baffling chore especially when initiated so soon after the accident i started with the phone book my only source and half the numbers in traffic went unanswered the other half were answered with great indifference it was early the weather was bad it was friday why get involved most wrecked cars were taken to a city lot on rasco road up in northeast i learned this from a secretary at the central precinct she worked in animal control i was dialing police extensions at random other cars were sometimes taken to other lots and there was a good chance mine could still be attached to the wrecker the wreckers were privately owned she explained and this had always caused trouble she once worked in traffic but hated it over there i thought of mordecai my new source for all information related to the street i waited until nine to call him i told him the story assured him i was in great shape in spite of being in a hospital and asked him if he knew how to find a wrecked car he had some ideas i called polly with the same story youre not coming in she asked her voice faltering im in the hospital polly are you listening to me there was hesitation on her end confirming what i feared i could envision a cake with a punch bowl next to it probably in a conference room on the table with fifty people standing around it proposing toasts and making short speeches about how wonderful i was i had been to a couple of those parties myself they were awful i was determined to avoid my own sendoff when are you getting out she asked dont know maybe tomorrow it was a lie i was leaving before noon with or without my medical teams approval more hesitation the cake the punch the important speeches from busy people maybe even a gift or two how would she handle it im sorry she said me too is anybody looking for me no not yet good please tell rudolph about the accident and ill call him later gotta go they want more tests and so my once promising career at drake and sweeney sputtered to an end i skipped my own retirement party at the age of thirtytwo i was freed from the shackles of corporate servitude and the money i was left to follow my conscience i wouldve felt great if not for the knife sticking through my ribs every time i moved claire arrived after eleven she huddled with my doctor in the hall i could hear them out there speaking their language they stepped into my room jointly announced my release and i changed into clean clothes she had brought from home she drove me there a short trip during which little was said there was no chance at reconciliation why should a simple car wreck change anything she was there as a friend and a doctor not a wife she fixed tomato soup and tucked me into the sofa she lined up my pills on the kitchen counter gave me my instructions and left i was still for ten minutes long enough to eat half the soup and a few of the saltines then i was on the phone mordecai had found nothing working from the classifieds i began calling realtors and apartment locating services then i called for a sedan from a car service i took a long hot shower to loosen my bruised body my driver was leon i sat in the front with him trying not to grimace and groan with each pothole he hit i couldnt afford a nice apartment but at the least i wanted one that was safe leon had some ideas we stopped at a newsstand and i picked up two free brochures on district real estate in leons opinion a good place to live right now but this could change in six months he warned me was adamsmorgan north of dupont circle it was a wellknown district one i had been through many times never with any desire to stop and browse the streets were lined with turnofthecentury rowhouses all of which were still inhabited which in dc meant a vibrant neighborhood the bars and clubs were hot at the moment according to leon and the best new restaurants were there the seedy sections were just around the corner and of course one had to be extremely careful if important people like senators got themselves mugged on capitol hill then no one was safe driving toward adamsmorgan leon was suddenly confronted with a pothole larger than his car we bounced through it getting airborne for what seemed to be ten seconds then landing very hard i couldnt help but scream as the entire left side of my torso collapsed in pain leon was horrified i had to tell him the truth where id slept last night he slowed down considerably and became my realtor he helped me up the stairs at my first prospect a rundown flat with the unmistakable smell of cat urine emanating from the carpet in no uncertain terms leon told the landlord she should be ashamed showing the place in such condition the second stop was a loft five floors above the street and i almost didnt make it up the stairs no elevator and not much heating leon politely thanked the manager the next loft was four floors up but with a nice clean elevator the rowhouse was on wyoming a pretty shaded street just off connecticut the rent was five hundred and fifty a month and i had already said yes before i saw the place i was sinking fast thinking more and more about the pain pills id left on the counter and ready to rent anything three tiny rooms in an attic with sloping ceilings a bathroom with plumbing that seemed to be working clean floors and something of a view over the street well take it leon said to the landlord i was leaning on a door frame ready to collapse in a small office in the basement i hurriedly read the lease signed it and wrote a check for the deposit and first months rent id told claire id be out by the weekend i was determined to make it happen if leon was curious about my move from the swankiness of georgetown to a threeroom pigeonhole in adamsmorgan he didnt ask he was too much of a professional he returned me to our apartment and he waited in the car while i swallowed my pills and took a quick nap a phone was ringing somewhere in the midst of my chemicalinduced fog i stumbled forth found it managed to say hello rudolph said thought you were in the hospital i heard his voice and recognized it but the fog was still clearing i was i said thicktongued now im not what do you want we missed you this afternoon ah yes the punch and cake show i didnt plan to be in a car wreck rudolph please forgive me a lot of people wanted to say goodbye they can drop me a line tell them to just fax it over you feel lousy dont you yes rudolph i feel like ive just been hit by a car are you on medication why do you care sorry look braden chance was in my office an hour ago hes quite anxious to see you odd dont you think the fog lifted and my head was much clearer see me about what he wouldnt say but hes looking for you tell him ive left i did sorry to bother you stop by if you get a minute you still have friends here thanks rudolph i stuffed the pills in my pockets leon was napping in the car as we sped away i called mordecai hed found the accident report it listed a hundley towing as the wrecker service hundley towing used an answering machine for most of its calls the streets were slick lots of accidents a busy time for people who owned tow trucks a mechanic had finally answered the phone around three but proved to be completely useless leon found the hundley place on rhode island near seventh in better days it had been a fullservice gas station now it was a garage towing service usedcar lot and uhaul trailer rental every window was adorned with black bars leon maneuvered as close as possible to the front door cover me i said as i got out and dashed inside the door kicked back when i walked through hitting me on my left arm i doubled over in pain a mechanic wearing overalls and grease rounded a comer and glared at me i explained why i was there he found a clipboard and studied papers stuck to it in the rear i could hear men talking and cursingno doubt they were back there shooting dice drinking whiskey probably selling crack the police have it he said still looking at the papers any idea why not really was there a crime or something yeah but my car wasnt involved with the crime he gave me a blank look he had his own problems any idea where it might be i asked trying to be pleasant when they impound them they usually take them to a lot up on georgia north of howard how many lots does the city have he shrugged and began walking away more than one he said and disappeared i managed the door with care then bolted for leons car it was dark when we found the lot half a city block lined with chain link and razor wire inside were hundreds of wrecked cars arranged haphazardly some stacked on top of others leon stood with me on the sidewalk peering through the chain link over there i said pointing the lexus was parked near a shed facing us the impact had demolished the left front the fender was gone the engine exposed and crushed youre a very lucky man leon said next to it was the jaguar its roof flattened all windows missing there was an office of some type in the shed but it was closed and dark the gates were locked with heavy chains the razor wire glistened in the rain there were tough guys hanging around a corner not far away i could feel them watching us lets get out of here i said leon drove me to national airport the only place i knew to rent a car the table was set carryout chinese was on the stove claire was waiting and worried to some degree though it was impossible to tell how much i told her i had to go rent a car pursuant to instructions from my insurance company she examined me like a good doctor and made me take a pill i thought you were going to rest she said i tried it didnt work im starving it would be our last meal together as husband and wife ending the same way wed begun with something fast and prepared elsewhere do you know someone named hector palma she asked halfway through dinner i swallowed hard yes he called an hour ago said it was important that he talk to you who is he a paralegal with the firm i was supposed to spend the morning with him going over one of my cases hes in a tight spot must be he wants to meet with you at nine tonight at nathans on m why a bar i mused he didnt say sounded suspicious my appetite vanished but i kept eating to appear unmoved not that it was necessary she couldnt have cared less i walked to m street in a light rain that was turning to sleet and in significant pain parking wouldve been impossible on friday night and i hoped to stretch my muscles some and clear my head the meeting could be nothing but trouble and i prepped for it as i walked i thought of lies to cover my trail and more lies to cover the first set now that i had stolen the lying didnt seem like such a big deal hector might be working for the firm there was a chance he could be wired i would listen carefully and say little nathans was only halffull i was ten minutes early but he was there waiting for me in a small booth as i approached he suddenly jumped from his seat and thrust a hand at me you must be michael im hector palma from real estate nice to meet you it was an assault a burst of personality that put me on my heels i shook hands reeling and said something like nice to meet you he pointed to the booth here have a seat he said all warmth and smiles i delicately bent and squeezed my way into the booth what happened to your face he asked i kissed an air bag yeah i heard about the accident he said quickly very quickly are you okay any broken bones no i said slowly trying to read him heard the other guy got killed he said a split second after id spoken he was in charge of this conversation i was supposed to follow along yeah some drug dealer this city he said as the waiter appeared whatll you have hector asked me black coffee i said at that moment as he pondered his choice of drinks one of his feet began tapping me on the leg what kind of beer do you have he asked the waiter a question they hated the waiter looked straight ahead and began rattling off brands the tapping brought our eyes together his hands were together on the table using the waiter as a shield he barely curled his right index finger and pointed to his chest molson he announced suddenly and the waiter left he was wired and they were watching wherever they were they couldnt see through the waiter instinctively i wanted to turn and examine the other people in the bar but i withstood the temptation thanks in no small part to a neck as pliable as a board that explained the hearty hello as if wed never met hector had been grilled all day and he was denying everything im a paralegal in real estate he explained youve met braden chance one of our partners yes since my words were being recorded i would offer little i work primarily for him you and i spoke briefly one day last week when you visited his office if you say so i dont remember seeing you i caught a very faint smile a relaxing around the eyes nothing a surveillance camera could catch under the table i tapped his leg with my foot hopefully we were dancing to the same tune look the reason i asked you to meet me is because a file is missing from bradens office am i the accused well no but youre a possible suspect it was the file you asked for when you sort of barged into his office last week then i am being accused i said hotly not yet relax the firm is doing a thorough investigation of the matter and were simply talking to everyone we can think of since i heard you ask braden for the file the firm instructed me to talk to you its that simple i dont know what youre talking about its that simple you know nothing about the file of course not why would i take a file from a partners office would you take a polygraph certainly i said firmly even indignantly there was no way in hell i would take a polygraph good theyre asking all of us to do it everybody remotely near the file the beer and coffee arrived giving us a brief pause to evaluate and reposition hector had just told me he was in deep trouble a polygraph would kill him did you meet michael brock before he left the firm did you discuss the missing file did you give him copies of anything taken from the file did you assist him in obtaining the missing file yes or no hard questions with simple answers there was no way he could lie and survive the test theyre fingerprinting too he said he said this in a lower voice not in an effort to avoid the hidden mike but rather to soften the blow it didnt work the thought of leaving prints had never occurred to me neither before the theft nor since good for them i said in fact they lifted prints all afternoon from the door the light switch the file cabinet lots of prints hope they find their man its really coincidental you know braden had a hundred active files in his office and the only one missing is the one you were quite anxious to see are you trying to say something i just said it a real coincidence he was doing this for the benefit of our listeners i thought perhaps i should perform too i dont like the way you said it i practically yelled at him if you want to accuse me of something then go to the cops get a warrant and get me picked up otherwise keep your stupid opinions to yourself the cops are already involved he said very coolly and my contrived temper melted its a theft of course its a theft go catch your thief and stop wasting your time with me he took a long drink did someone give you a set of keys to bradens office of course not well they found this empty file on your desk with a note about the two keys one to the door the other to a file cabinet i know nothing about it i said as arrogantly as possible while trying to remember the last place id put the empty file my trail was widening id been trained to think like a lawyer not a criminal another long drink by hector another sip of coffee by me enough had been said the messages had been delivered one by the firm the other by hector himself the firm wanted the file back with its contents uncompromised hector wanted me to know that his involvement could cost him his job it was up to me to save him i could return the file confess promise to keep it sealed and the firm would probably forgive me there would be no harm protecting hectors job could be a condition of the return anything else i asked suddenly ready to leave nothing when can you do the polygraph ill give you a call i picked up my coat and left sixteen for reasons that i would soon understand mordecai had an intense dislike for district cops even though most were black in his opinion they were rough on the homeless and that was the standard he invariably used to measure good and bad but he knew a few one was sergeant peeler a man described by mordecai as from the streets peeler worked with troubled kids in a community center near the legal clinic and he and mordecai belonged to the same church peeler had contacts and could pull enough strings to get me to my car he walked into the clinic shortly after nine saturday morning mordecai and i were drinking coffee and trying to stay warm peeler didnt work saturdays i got the impression he would have rather stayed in bed with mordecai doing the driving and talking and with me in the back we rode through the slick streets into northeast the snow they had forecast was instead a cold rain traffic was light it was another raw february morning only the hearty ventured onto the sidewalks we parked at the curb near the padlocked gates to the city lot just off georgia avenue peeler said wait here i could see the remains of my lexus he walked to the gates pushed a button on a pole and the door to the office shed opened a small thin uniformed policeman with an umbrella came over and he and peeler exchanged a few words peeler returned to the car slamming the door and shaking the water off his shoulders hes waiting for you he said i stepped into the rain raised my umbrella and walked quickly to the gates where officer winkle was waiting without the slightest trace of humor or goodwill he produced keys by the dozens somehow found the three that fit the heavy padlocks and said to me over here as he opened the gates i followed him through the gravel lot avoiding when possible the potholes filled with brown water and mud my entire body ached with every move so my hopping and dodging were restricted he went straight to my car i went right to the front seat no file after a moment of panic i found it behind the drivers seat on the floor intact i grabbed it and was ready to go i was in no mood to survey the damage id walked away from i had survived in one piece and that was all that mattered id haggle with the insurance company next week is that it winkle asked yes i said ready to bolt follow me we entered the shed where a butane heater roared in a corner blasting us with hot air tie selected one of ten clipboards from the wall and began stating at the file i was holding brown manila file he said as he wrote about two inches thick i stood there clutching it as if it were gold is there a name on it i was in no position to protest one smartass remark and they would never find me why do you need it i asked put it on the table he said on the table it went riveroaks slash tag inc he said still writing file number tbc my trail widened even more do you own this he asked pointing with no small amount of suspicion yes okay you can go now i thanked him and got no response i wanted to jog across the lot but walking was enough of a challenge he locked the gates behind me mordecai and peeler both turned around and looked at the file once i was inside neither had a clue i had told mordecai only that the file was very important i needed to retrieve it before it was destroyed all that effort for one plain manila file i was tempted to flip through it as we drove back to the clinic but i didnt i thanked peeler said goodbye to mordecai and drove cautiously to my new loft the source of the money was the federal government no surprise in dc the postal service planned to construct a twentymilliondollar bulkmail facility in the city and riveroaks was one of several aggressive real estate companies hoping to build lease and manage it several sites had been considered all in rough and decaying sections of the city a short list of three had been announced the previous december riveroaks had begun snapping up all the cheap real estate it might need tag was a duly registered corporation whose sole stockholder was tilhnan ginitry described in a file memo as a former pimp smalltime hustler and twiceconvicted felon one of many such characters in the city after crime gantry had discovered used cars and real estate he purchased abandoned buildings sometimes doing quickie renovations and reselling sometimes offering space for rent fourteen tag properties were listed in a file summary gantrys path crossed that of riveroaks when the us postal service needed more space on january the postal service informed riveroaks by registered mail that the company had been chosen to be the contractorownerlandlord of the new bulk facility a memorandum of agreement provided for annual rental payments of million for a guaranteed period of twenty years the letter also said with nongovemmentallike haste that a final agreement between riveroaks and the postal service would have to be signed no later than march or the deal was off after seven years of contemplating and planning the feds wanted it built overnight riveroaks and its lawyers and realtors went to work in january the company purchased four properties on florida near the warehouse where the eviction took place the file had two maps of the area with shaded colors indicating lots purchased and lots under negotiation march was only seven days away small wonder chance missed the file so quickly he was working with it every day the warehouse on florida avenue had been purchased by tag the previous july for a sum not revealed in the file riveroaks bought it for two hundred thousand dollars on january four days before the eviction that sent devon hardy and the burton family into the streets on the bare wooden floor of what would become my living room i carefully removed each sheet of paper from the file examined it then described it in detail on a legal pad so that i could put it back together in perfect order there was the usual collection of papers i assumed to be in every real estate file tax records for prior years a chain of title previous deeds an agreement for the purchase and sale of the property correspondence with the realtor closing papers it was a cash deal so no bank was involved on the left inside flap of the file was the journal a preprinted form used to log each entry by date and brief description you could judge the organizational capacity of a drake and sweeney secretary by the level of detail in a files journal every piece of paper map photo or chartanything and everything that was punched into a file was supposed to be recorded in the journal this had been drilled into our heads during boot camp most of us had learned the hard waythere was nothing more frustrating than flipping through a thick file in search of something that had not been logged in with sufficient detail if you cant find it in thirty seconds the axiom said its useless chances file was meticulous his secretary was a woman of details but there had been tampering on january hector palma went to the warehouse alone for a routine prepurchase inspection as he was entering a designated door he was mugged by two street punks who hit him over the head with a stick of some sort and took his wallet and cash at knifepoint he stayed at home on january and prepared a memo to the file describing the assault the last sentence read will return on monday january with guard to inspect the memo was properly logged into the file but there was no memo from his second visit a january entry into the journal said hp memosite visit inspection of premises hector went to the warehouse on the twentyseventh with a guard inspected the place no doubt found that serious squatting was under way and prepared a memo which judging by his other paperwork was probably quite thorough the memo had been removed from the file certainly no crime and i had taken things from files all the time without making a note in the journal but i damned sure put them back if an item was logged in it was supposed to be in the file the closing took place on january a friday the following tuesday hector returned to the warehouse to remove the squatters he was assisted by a guard from a private security firm a district cop and four roughnecks from an eviction company it took three hours according to his memo which ran for two pages though he tried to mask his emotions hector didnt have the stomach for evictions my heart stopped when i read the following the mother had four children one an infant she lived in a tworoom apartment with no plumbing they slept on two mattresses on the floor she fought with the policeman while her children watched she was eventually removed so ontario watched while his mother fought there was a list of those evicted seventeen in all with children excluded the same list someone had placed on my desk monday morning with a copy of the post story in the back of the file lying loose without the benefit of a journal entry were eviction notices for the seventeen they had not been used squatters have no rights including the right to be notified the notices had been prepared as an afterthought an effort to cover the trail they had probably been stock in after the mister episode by chance himself just in case he might need them the tampering was obvious and foolish but then chance was a partner it was virtually unheard of for a partner to surrender a file it hadnt been surrendered it had been stolen an act of larceny a crime for which evidence was now being gathered the thief was an idiot as part of my preemployment ritual seven years earlier i had been fingerprinted by private investigators it would be a simple matter to match those prints with the ones lifted from chances file cabinet it would take only minutes i was certain it had already been done could there be a warrant for my arrest it was inevitable most of the floor was covered when i finished three hours after i started i carefully reassembled the file then drove to the clinic and copied it she was shopping her note said we had nice luggage an item we failed to mention when we split the assets she would be traveling more than i in the near future so i took the cheap stuffduffel and gym bags i didnt want to get caught so i threw the basics into a pile on the bedsocks underwear tee shirts miletries shoes but only the ones i had worn in the past year she could discard the others i hurriedly cleaned out my drawers and my side of the medicine cabinet wounded and aching physically and otherwise i hauled the bags down two flights of stairs to my rental car then went back up for a load of suits and dress clothes i found my old sleeping bag unused for at least the last five years and carried it down along with a quilt and a pillow i was entitled to my alarm clock radio portable cd player with a few cds thirteeninch color tv on the kitchen counter one coffeepot hair dryer and the set of blue towels when the car was full i left a note telling her i was gone i placed it next to the one shed left and refused to stare at it my emotions were mixed and just under the skin and i was not equipped to deal with them id never moved out before i wasnt sure how it was done i locked the door and walked down the stairs i knew i would be back in a couple of days to get the rest of my things but the trip down felt like the last time she would read the note check the drawers and closets to see what i had taken and when she realized i had indeed moved out she would sit in the den for a quick tear maybe a good cry but it would be over before long she would easily move to the next phase as i drove away there was no feeling of liberation it wasnt a thrill to be single again claire and i had both lost seventeen i locked myself inside the office the clinic was colder sunday than it had been on saturday i wore a heavy sweater corduroy pants thermal socks and i read the paper at my desk with two steaming cups of coffee in front of me the building had a heating system but i wasnt about to meddle with it i missed my chair my leather executive swivel that rocked and reclined and rolled at my command my new one was a small step above a folding job youd rent for a wedding it promised to be uncomfortable on good days in my pummeled condition at that moment it was a torture device the desk was a battered handmedown probably from an abandoned school square and boxlike with three drawers down each side all of which actually opened but not without a struggle the two clients chairs on the other side were indeed folding typesone black the other a greenish color id never seen before the walls were plaster painted decades ago and allowed to fade into a shade of pale lemon the plaster was cracked the spiders had taken over the corners at the ceiling the only decoration was a framed placard advertising a march for justice on the mall in july of the floor was ancient oak the planks rounded at the edges evidence of heavy use in prior years it had been swept recently the broom still standing in a corner with a dustpan a gentle cue that if i wanted the dirt cleared again then it was up to me oh how the mighty had fallen if my dear brother warner couldve seen me sitting there on sunday shivering at my sad little desk staring at the cracks in the plaster locked in so that my potential clients couldnt mug me he wouldve hurled insults so rich and colorful that i wouldve been compelled to write them down i couldnt comprehend my parents reaction i would be forced to call them soon and deliver the double shock of my changes of address a loud bang at the door scared the hell out of me i bolted upright unsure of what to do were the street punks coming after me another knock as i moved toward the front and i could see a figure trying to look through the bars and thick glass of the front door it was barry nuzzo shivering and anxious to get to safety i got things unlocked and let him in what a slumhole he began pleasantly looking around the front room as i relocked the door quaint isnt it i said reeling from his presence and trying to figure out what it meant what a dump he was amused by the place he walked around sofias desk slowly taking off his gloves afraid to touch anything for fear of starting an avalanche of files we keep the overhead low so we can take all the money home i said it was an old joke around drake and sweeney the partners were constantly bitching about the overhead while at the same time most were concerned about redecorating their offices so youre here for the money he asked still amused of course youve lost your mind ive found a calling yeah youre hearing voices is that why youre here to tell me im crazy i called claire and what did she say said you had moved out thats true were getting a divorce whats wrong with your face air bag oh yeah i forgot i heard it was just a fender bender it was the fenders got bent he draped his coat over a chair then hurriedly put it back on does low overhead mean you dont pay your heating bill now and then we skip a month he walked around some more peeking into the small offices to the side who pays for this operation he asked a trust a declining trust yes a rapidly declining trust howd you find it mister hung out here these were his lawyers good old mister he said he stopped his examination for a moment and stared at a wall do you think he wouldve killed us no nobody was listening to him he was just another homeless guy he wanted to be heard did you ever consider jumping him no but i thought about grabbing his gun and shooting rafter i wish you had maybe next time got any coffee sure have a seat i didnt want barry to follow me into the kitchen because it left much to be desired i found a cup washed it quickly and filled it with coffee i invited him into my office nice he said looking around this is where all the long balls are hit i said proudly we took positions across the desk both chairs squeaking and on the verge of collapse is this what you dreamed about in law school he asked i dont remember law school ive billed too many hours since then he finally looked at me without a smirk or a smile and the kidding was set aside as bad as the thought was i couldnt help but wonder if barry was wired they had sent hector into the fray with a bug under his shirt they would do the same with barry he wouldnt volunteer but they could apply the pressure i was the enemy so you came here searching for mister he said i guess what did you find are you playing dumb barry whats happening at the firm have you guys circled the wagons are you coming after me he weighed this carefully while taking quick sips from his mug this coffee is awful he said ready to spit at least its hot im sorry about claire thanks but id rather not talk about it theres a file missing michael everyones pointing at you who knows youre here my wife the firm send you absolutely not i believed him hed been a friend for seven years close at times more often than not though wed been too busy for friendship why are they pointing at me the file has something to do with mister you went to braden chance and demanded to see it you were seen near his office the night it disappeared there is evidence someone gave you some keys that perhaps you shouldnt have had is that all that and the fingerprints fingerprints i asked trying to appear surprised all over the place the door the light switch the file cabinet itself perfect matches you were there michael you took the file now what will you do with it how much do you know about the file mister got evicted by one of our real estate clients he was a squatter he went nuts scared the hell out of us you almost got hit you cracked up is that all thats all theyve told us they being they being the big dogs we got memos late friday the entire firm lawyers secretaries paralegals ev erybodyinforming us that a file had been taken you were the suspect and that no member of the firm should have any contact with you i am forbidden to be here right now i wont tell thanks if braden chance had made the connection between the eviction and lontae burton he was not the type who would admit this to anyone not even his fellow partners barry was being truthful he probably thought my only interest in the file was devon hardy then why are you here im your friend things are crazy right now my god we had cops in the office on friday can you believe that last week it was the swat team and we were hostages now youve jumped off a cliff and the thing with claire why dont we take a break lets go somewhere for a couple of weeks take our wives where i dont know who cares the islands what would that accomplish we could thaw out for one thing play some tennis sleep get recharged paid for by the firm paid for by me forget about claire its over barry it took a long time but its over okay the two of us will go but youre not supposed to have any contact with me i have an idea i think i can go to arthur and have a long chat we can unwind this thing you bring back the file forget whatever is in it the firm forgives and forgets too you and i go play tennis for two weeks on maui then when we return you go back to your plush office where you belong they sent you didnt they no i swear it wont work barry give me a good reason please theres more to being a lawyer than billing hours and making money why do we want to become corporate whores im tired of it barry i want to make a difference you sound like a firstyear law student exactly we got into this business because we thought the law was a higher calling we could fight injustice and social ills and do all sorts of great things because we were lawyers we were idealistic once why cant we do it again mortgages im not trying to recruit you have three kids luckily claire and i have none i can afford to go a little nuts a radiator in a corner one i had not yet noticed began to rattle and hiss we watched it and waited hopefully for a little heat a minute passed then two theyre gonna come after you michael he said still looking at the radiator but not seeing they you mean we right the firm you cant steal a file think about the client the client has a right to expect confidentiality if a file walks out the firm has no choice but to go after it criminal charges probably theyre mad as hell michael you cant blame them theres also talk of a disciplinary action with the bar association an injunction is likely rafter is already working on it why couldnt mister have aimed a little lower theyre coming hard the firm has more to lose than i do he studied me he did not know what was in the file theres more than mister he asked a lot more the firm has tremendous exposure if they come after me i go after the firm you cant use a stolen file no court in the country will allow it into evidence you dont understand litigation im learning tell them to back off remember ive got the file and the files got the dirt they were just a bunch of squatters michael its much more complicated than that someone needs to sit down with braden chance and get the truth tell rafter to do his homework before he pulls some harebrained stunt believe me barry this is frontpage stuff you guys will be afraid to leave your homes so youre proposing a truce you keep the file we leave you alone for now anyway i dont know about next week or the week after why cant you talk to arthur ill referee the three of us will get in a room lock the door work this thing out what do you say its too late people are dead mister got himself killed there are others and with that i had said enough though he was my friend he would repeat most of our conversation to his bosses would you like to explain he said i cant its confidential that has a phony sound to it coming from a lawyer who steals files the radiator gurgled and burped and it was easier to watch it than to talk for a while neither of us wanted to say things we would later regret he asked about the other employees of the clinic i gave him a quick tour unbelievable he mumbled more than once can we keep in touch he said at the door sure eighteen my orientation lasted about thirty minutes the time it took us to drive from the clinic to the samaritan house in petworth in northeast mordecai handled the driving and the talking i sat quietly holding my briefcase as nervous as any rookie about to be fed to the wolves i wore jeans a white shirt and tie an old navy blazer and on my feet i had wellworn nike tennis shoes and white socks i had stopped shaving i was a street lawyer and i could dress any way i wanted mordecai of course had instantly noted the change in style when i walked into his office and announced i was ready for work he didnt say anything but his glance lingered on the nikes he had seen it all before bigfirm types coming down from the towers to spend a few hours with the poor for some reason they felt compelled to grow whiskers and wear denim your clientele will be a mixture of thirds he said driving badly with one hand holding coffee with another oblivious to any of the other vehicles crowded around us about a third are employed a third are families with children a third are mentally disabled a third are veterans and about a third of those eligible for lowincome housing receive it in the past fifteen years two and a half million lowcost housing units have been eliminated and the federal housing programs have been cut seventy percent small wonder people are living on the streets governments are balancing budgets on the backs of the poor the statistics flowed forth with no effort whatsoever this was his life and his profession as a lawyer trained to keep meticulous notes i fought the compulsion to rip open my briefcase and begin scribbling i just listened these people have minimumwage jobs so private housing is not even considered they dont even dream about it and their earned income has not kept pace with housing costs so they fall farther and farther behind and at the same time assistance programs take more and more hits get this only fourteen percent of disabled homeless people receive disability benefits fourteen percent youll see a lot of these cases we squealed to a stop at a red light his car partially blocking the intersection horns erupted all around us i slid lower in the seat waiting for another collision mordecai hadnt the slightest clue that his car was impeding rushhour traffic he stared blanldy ahead in another world the frightening part of homelessness is what you dont see on the street about half of all poor people spend seventy percent of their income trying to keep the housing they have hud says they should spend a third there are tens of thousands of people in this city who are clinging to their roofs one missed paycheck one unexpected hospital visit one unseen emergency and they lose their housing where do they go they rarely go straight to the shelters at first theyll go to their families then friends the strain is enormous because their families and friends also have subsidized housing and their leases restrict the number of people who can live in one unit theyre forced to violate their leases which can lead to eviction they move around sometimes they leave a kid with this sister and a kid with that friend things go from bad to worse a lot of homeless people are afraid of the shelters and they are desperate to avoid them he paused long enough to drink his coffee why i asked not all shelters are good there have been assaults robberies even rapes and this was where i was expected to spend the rest of my legal career i forgot my gun i said youll be okay there are hundreds of pro bono volunteers in this city ive never heard of one getting hurt thats good to hear we were moving again somewhat safer about half of the people have some type of substance abuse problem like your pal devon hardy its very common what can you do for them not much im afraid there are a few programs left but its hard to find a bed we were successful in placing hardy in a recovery unit for veterans but he walked away the addict decides when he wants to get sober whats the drug of choice alcohol its the most affordable a lot of crack because its cheap too youll see everything but the designer drugs are too expensive what will my first five cases be anxious arent you yeah and i dont have a clue relax the work is not complicated it takes patience youll see a person whos not getting benefits probably food stamps a divorce someone with a complaint against a landlord an employment dispute youre guaranteed a criminal case what type of criminal case small stuff the trend in urban america is to criminalize homelessness the big cities have passed all sorts of laws designed to persecute those who live on the streets cant beg cant sleep on a bench cant camp under a bridge cant store personal items in a public park cant sit on a sidewalk cant eat in public many of these have been struck down by the courts abraham has done some beautiful work convincing federal judges that these bad laws infringe on first amendment rights so the cities selectively enforce general laws such as loitering and public drunkenness they target the homeless some guy with a nice suit gets drunk in a bar and pees in an alley no big deal a homeless guy pees in the same alley and hes arrested for urinating in public sweeps are common sweeps yes theyll target one area of the city shovel up all the homeless dump them somewhere else atlanta did it before the olympicscouldnt have all those poor people begging and sleeping on park benches with the world watchingso they sent in the ss troops and eliminated the problem then the city bragged about how pretty everything looked where did they put them they damned sure didnt take them to shelters because they dont have any they simply moved them around dumped them in other parts of the city like manure a quick sip of coffee as he adjusted the heater no hands on the wheel for five seconds remember michael everybody has to be somewhere these people have no alternatives if youre hungry you beg for food if youre tired then you sleep wherever you can find a spot if youre homeless you have to live somewhere do they arrest them every day and its stupid public policy take a guy living on the streets in and out of shelters working somewhere for minimum wage trying his best to step up and become selfsufficient then he gets arrested for sleeping under a bridge he doesnt want to be sleeping under a bridge but everybodys got to sleep somewhere hes guilty because the city council in its brilliance has made it a crime to be homeless he has to pay thirty bucks just to get out of jail and another thirty for his fine sixty bucks out of a very shallow pocket so the guy gets kicked down another notch hes been arrested humiliated fined punished and hes supposed to see the error of his ways and go find a home get off the damned streets its happening in most of our cities wouldnt he be better off in jail have you been to jail lately no dont go cops are not trained to deal with the homeless especially the mentally ill and the addicts the jails are overcrowded the criminal justice system is a nightmare to begin with and persecuting the homeless only clogs it more and heres the asinine part it costs twentyfive percent more per day to keep a person in jail than to provide shelter food transportation and counseling services these of course would have a longterm benefit these of course would make more sense twentyfive percent and that doesnt include the costs of arrests and processing most of the cities are broke anyway especially dcthats why theyre closing shelters rememberyet they waste money by making criminals out of the homeless seems ripe for litigation i said though he needed no prompting were suing like crazy advocates all over the country are attacking these laws damned cities are spending more on legal fees than on building shelters for the homeless you gotta love this country new york richest city in the world cant house its people so they sleep on the streets and panhandle on fifth avenue and this upsets the sensitive new yorkers so they elect rudy whatshisface who promises to clean up the streets and he gets his blue ribbon city council to outlaw homelessness just like thatcant beg cant sit on the sidewalk cant be homelessand they cut budgets like hell close shelters and cut assistance and at the same time they spend a bloody fortune paying new york lawyers to defend them for trying to eliminate poor people how bad is washington not as bad as new york but not much better im afraid we were in a part of town i would not have driven through in broad daylight in an armored vehicle two weeks ago the storefronts were laden with black iron bars the apartment buildings were tall lifeless structures with laundry hanging over the railings each was graybricked each stamped with the architectural blandness of hurried federal money washington is a black city he continued with a large welfare class it attracts a lot of people who want change a lot of activists and radicals people like you tm hardly an activist or a radical its monday morning think of where youve been every monday morning for the past seven years at my desk a very nice desk yes in your elegantly appointed office yes he offered me a large grin and said you are now a radical and with that orientation ended ahead on the right was a group of heavily clad men huddled over a portable butane burner on a street corner we turned beside them and parked at the curb the building was once a department store many years in the past a handpainted sign read samaritan house its a private shelter mordecai said ninety beds decent food funded by a coalition of churches in arlington weve been coming here for six years a van from a food bank was parked by the door volunteers unloaded boxes of vegetables and fruit mordecai spoke to an elderly gentleman who worked the door and we were allowed inside ill give you a quick tour mordecai said i stayed close to him as we walked through the main floor it was a maze of short hallways each lined with small square rooms made of unpainted sheetrock each room had a door with a lock one was open mordecai looked inside and said good morning a tiny man with wild eyes sat on the edge of a cot looking at us but saying nothing this is a good room mordecai said to me it has privacy a nice bed room to store things and electricity he flipped a switch by the door and the bulb of a small lamp went out the room was darker for a second then he flipped the switch again the wild eyes never moved there was no ceiling for the room the aging panels of the old store were thirty feet above what about a bathroom i asked theyre in the back few shelters provide individual baths have a nice day he said to the resident who nodded radios were on some with music some with news talk people were moving about it was monday morning they had jobs and places to be is it hard to get a room here i asked certain of the answer nearly impossible theres a waiting list a mile long and the shelter can screen who gets in how long do they stay here it varies three months is probably a good average this is one of the nicer shelters so theyre safe here as soon as they get stable the shelter starts trying to relocate them into affordable housing he introduced me to a young woman in black combat boots who ran the place our new lawyer was my description she welcomed me to the shelter they talked about a client whod disappeared and i drifted along the hallway until i found the family section i heard a baby cry and walked to an open door the room was slightly larger and divided into cubicles a stout woman of no more than twentyfive was sitting in a chair naked from the waist up breastfeeding an infant thoroughly unfazed by my gawking ten feet away two small children were tumbling over a bed rap came from a radio with her right hand the woman cupped her unused breast and offered it to me i bolted down the hall and found mordecai clients awaited us our office was in a comer of the dining hall near the kitchen our desk was a folding table we borrowed from the cook mordecai unlocked a file cabinet in the corner and we were in business six people sat in a row of chairs along the wall whos first he announced and a woman came forward with her chair she sat across from her lawyers both ready with pen and legal pad one a seasoned veteran of street law the other clueless her name was waylene age twentyseven two children no husband half will come from the shelter mordecai said to me as we took notes the other half come from the streets we take anybody anybody whos homeless waylenes problem was not complicated she had worked in a fastfood restaurant before quitting for some reason mordecai deemed irrelevant and she was owed her last two paychecks because she had no permanent address the employer had sent the checks to the wrong place the checks had disappeared the employer was unconcerned where will you be staying next week mordecai asked her she wasnt sure maybe here maybe there she was looking for a job and if she found one then other events might occur and she could possibly move in with so and so or get a place of her own ill get your money and ill have the checks sent to my office he handed her a business card phone me at this number in a week she took the card thanked us and hurried away call the taco place identify yourself as her attorney be nice at first then raise hell if they dont cooperate if necessary stop by and pick up the checks yourself i wrote down these instructions as if they were complicated waylene was owed two hundred ten dollars the last case i worked on at drake and sweeney was an antitrust dispute with nine hundred million dollars at stake the second client was unable to articulate a specific legal problem he just wanted to talk to someone he was drunk or mentally ill probably both and mordecai walked him to the kitchen and poured him coffee some of these poor folks cant resist getting in a line he said number three was a resident of the shelter had been for two months so the address challenge was simpler she was fiftyeight clean and neat and the widow of a veteran according to the stack of paperwork i rummaged through while my cocounsel talked to her she was entitled to veterans benefits but the checks were being sent to a bank account in maryland one she could not access she explained this her paperwork verified it mordecai said va is a good agency well get the checks sent here the line grew as we efficiently worked the clients mordecai had seen it all before food stamps disrupted for lack of a permanent address a landlords refusal to refund a security deposit unpaid child support an arrest warrant for writing bad checks a claim for social security disability benefits after two hours and ten clients i moved to the end of the table and began interviewing them myself during my first full day as a poverty lawyer i was on my own taking notes and acting just as important as my cocounsel marvis was my first solo client he needed a divorce so did i after listening to his tale of sorrow i felt like racing home to claire and kissing her feet maryis wife was a prostitute who at one time had been a decent sort until she discovered crack the crack led her to a pusher then to a pimp then to life on the streets along the way she stole and sold everything they owned and racked up debts he got stuck with he filed for bankruptcy she took both kids and moved in with her pimp he had a few general questions about the mechanics of divorce and since i knew only the basics i winged it as best i could in the midst of my notetaking i was struck by a vision of claire sitting in her lawyers fine office at that very moment finalizing plans to dissolve our union how long will it take he asked bringing me out of my brief daydream six months i answered do you think she will contest it what do you mean will she agree to the divorce we aint talked about it the woman had moved out a year earlier and that sounded like a good case of abandonment to me throw in the adultery and i figured the case was a cinch marvis had been at the shelter for a week he was clean sober and looking for work i enjoyed the half hour i spent with him and i vowed to get his divorce the morning passed quickly my nervousness vanished i was reaching out to help real people with real problems little people with no other place to go for legal representation they were intimidated not only by me but also by the vast world of laws and regulations and courts and bureaucracies i learned to smile and make them feel welcome some apologized for not being able to pay me money was not important i told them money was not important at twelve we surrendered our table so lunch could be served the dining area was crowded the soup was ready since we were in the neighborhood we stopped for soul food at the florida avenue grill mine was the only white face in the crowded restaurant but i was coming to terms with my whiteness no one had tried to murder me yet no one seemed to care sofia found a phone that happened to be working it was under a stack of files on the desk nearest the door i thanked her and retreated to the privacy of my office i counted eight people sitting quietly and waiting for sofia the nonlawyer to dispense advice mordecai suggested that i spend the afternoon working on the cases we had taken in during the morning at samaritan there was a total of nineteen he also implied that i should work diligently so that i could help sofia with the traffic if i thought the pace would be slower on the street i was wrong i was suddenly up to my ears with other peoples problems fortunately with my background as a selfabsorbed workaholic i was up to the task my first phone call however went to drake and sweeney i asked for hector palma in real estate and was put on hold i hung up after five minutes then called again a secretary finally answered then put me on hold again the abrasive voice of braden chance was suddenly barking in my ear can i help you i swallowed hard and said yes i was holding for hector palma i tried to raise my voice and clip my words who is this he demanded rick hamilton an old friend from school he doesnt work here anymore sorry he hung up and i stared at the phone i thought about calling polly and asking her to check around see what had happened to hector it wouldnt take her long or maybe rudolph or barry nuzzo or my own favorite paralegal then i realized that they were no longer my friends i was gone i was offlimits i was the enemy i was trouble and the powers above had forbidden them to talk to me there were three hector palmas in the phone book i was going to call them but the phone lines were taken the clinic had two lines and four advocates nineteen i was in no hurry to leave the clinic at the end of my first day home was an empty attic not much larger than any three of the cubbyholes at the samaritan house home was a bedroom with no bed a living room with cableless tv a kitchen with a card table and no fridge i had vague distant plans to furnish and decorate sofia left promptly at five her standard hour her neighborhood was rough and she preferred to be home with the doors locked at dark mordecai left around six after spending thirty minutes with me discussing the day dont stay too late he warned and try to leave in pairs he had checked with abraham lebow who planned to work until nine and suggested we leave together park close walk fast watch everything so what do you think he asked pausing by the door on the way out i think its fascinating work the human contact is inspiring itll break your heart at times it already has thats good if you reach the point where it doesnt hurt then its time to quit i just started i know and its good to have you weve needed a wasp around here then im just happy to be a token he left and i closed the door again i had detected an unspoken opendoor policy sofia worked out in the open and i had been amused throughout the afternoon as i heard her berate one bureaucrat after another over the phone while the entire clinic listened mordecai was an animal on the phone his deep gravel voice roaring through the air making all sorts of demands and vile threats abraham was much quieter but his door was always open since i didnt yet know what i was doing i preferred to keep mine closed i was sure they would be patient i called the three hector palmas in the phone book the first was not the hector i wanted the second number was not answered the third was voice mail for the real hector palma the message was brusque were not home leave message well return your call it was his voice with infinite resources the firm had many ways and places to hide hector palma eight hundred lawyers paralegals offices in washington new york chicago la portland palm beach london and hong kong they were too smart to fire him because he knew too much so they would double his pay promote him move him to a different office in a new city with a larger apartment i wrote down his address from the phone book if the voice mail was still working perhaps he hadnt yet moved with my newly acquired street savvy i was sure i could track him down there was a slight knock on the door which opened as it was being tapped the bolt and knob were worn and wobbly and the door would shut but it wouldnt catch it was abraham got a minute he said sitting down it was his courtesy call his hello he was a quiet distant man with an intense brainy aura that would have been intimidating except for the fact that i had spent the past seven years in a building with four hundred lawyers of all stripes and sorts i had met and known a dozen abrahams aloof and earnest types with little regard for social skills i wanted to welcome you he said then immediately launched into a passionate justification for public interest law he was a middleclass kid from brooklyn law school at columbia three horrible years with a wall street firm four years in atlanta with an antideathpenalty group two frustrating years on capitol hill then an ad in a lawyers magazine for an advocates position with the th street legal clinic had caught his attention the law is a higher calling he said its more than making money then he delivered another speech a tirade against big firms and lawyers who rake in millions in fees a friend of his from brooklyn was making ten million a year suing breast implant companies from coast to coast ten million dollars a year you could house and feed every homeless person in the district anyway he was delighted i had seen the light and sorry about the episode with mister what specifically do you do i asked i was enjoying our talk he was fiery and bright with a vast vocabulary that kept me reeling two things policy i work with other advocates to shape legislation and i direct litigation usually class actions weve sued the commerce department because the homeless were grossly underrepresented in the ninety census weve sued the district school system for refusing to admit homeless children weve sued as a class because the district wrongfully terminated several thousand housing grants without due process weve attacked many of the statutes designed to criminalize homelessness well sue for almost anything if the homeless are getting screwed thats complicated litigation it is but fortunately here in dc we have lots of very good lawyers willing to donate their time im the coach i devise the game plan put the team together then call the plays you dont see clients occasionally but i work best when im in my little room over there alone thats the reason im glad youre here we need help with the traffic he jumped to his feet the conversation was over we planned our getaway at precisely nine and he was gone in the midst of one of his speeches i had noticed he did not have a wedding band the law was his life the old adage that the law was a jealous mistress had been taken to a new level by people like abraham and myself the law was all we had the district police waited until almost am then struck like commandos they rang the doorbell then immediately started hitting the door with their fists by the time claire could collect her wits get out of bed and pull something on over her pajamas they were kicking the door ready to smash it in police they announced after her terrified inquiry she slowly opened the door then stepped back in horror as four mentwo in uniforms and two in suitsrushed in as if lives were in danger stand back one demanded she was unable to speak stand back he screamed at her they slammed the door behind them the leader lieutenant gasko in a cheap tight suit stepped forward and jerked from his pocket some folded papers are you claire brock he asked in his worst columbo impersonation she nodded mouth open im lieutenant gasko wheres michael brock he doesnt live here anymore she managed to utter the other three hovered nearby ready to pounce on something there was no way gasko could believe this but he didnt have a warrant for arrest just one authorizing a search i have a search warrant for this apartment signed by judge kisner at five pm this afternoon he unfolded the papers and held them open for her to see as if the fine print could be read and appreciated at that moment please stand aside he said claire backed up even farther what are you looking for she asked its in the papers gasko said tossing them onto the kitchen counter the four fanned out through the apartment the cell phone was next to my head which was resting on a pillow on the floor at the opening of my sleeping bag it was the third night id slept on the floor part of my effort to identify with my new clients i was eating little sleeping even less rating to acquire an appreciation for park benches and sidewalks the left side of my body was purple down to the knee extremely sore and painful and so i slept on my right side it was a small price to pay i had a roof heat a locked door a job the security of food tomorrow the future i found the cell phone and said hello michael claire hissed in a low voice the cops are searching the apartment what theyre here now four of them with a search warrant what do they want theyre looking for a file ti be there in ten minutes please hurry i roared into the apartment like a man possessed gasko happened to be the first cop i encountered im michael brock who the hell are you lieutenant gasko he said with a sneer let me see some identification i turned to claire who was leaning on the refrigerator holding a cup of coffee get me a piece of paper i said gasko pulled his badge from his coat pocket and held it high for me to see larry gasko i said youll be the first person i sue at nine oclock this morning now whos with you there are three others claire said handing me a sheet of paper i think theyre in the bedrooms i walked to the rear of the apartment gasko behind me claire somewhere behind him i saw a plainclothes cop in the guest bedroom on all fours peeking under the bed let me see some identification i yelled at him he scrambled to his feet ready to fight i took a step closer gritted my teeth and said id asshole who are you he asked taking a step back looking at gasko michael brock who are you he flipped out a badge darrell clark i announced loudly as i scribbled it down defendant number two you cant sue me he said watch me big boy in eight hours in federal court i will sue you for a million bucks for an illegal search and ill win and get a judgment then ill hound your ass until you file for bankruptcy the other two cops appeared from my old bedroom and i was surrounded by them claire i said get the video camera please i want this recorded she disappeared into the living room we have a warrant signed by a judge gasko said somewhat defensively the other three took a step forward to tighten the circle the search is illegal i said bitterly the people who signed the warrant will be sued each of you will be sued you will be placed on leave probably without pay and you will face a civil lawsuit we have immunity gasko said glancing at his buddies like hell you do claire was back with the camera did you tell them i didnt live here i asked her i did she said and raised the camera to her eye yet you boys continued the search at that point it became illegal you shouldve known to stop but of course that wouldnt be any fun would it its much more fun to pilfer through the private things of others you had a chance boys and you blew it now youll have to pay the consequences youre nuts gasko said they tried not to show fearbut they knew i was a lawyer they had not found me in the apartment so maybe i knew what i was talking about i did not but at that moment it sounded good the legal ice upon which i was skating was very thin i ignored him your names please i said to the two uniformed cops they produced badges ralph lilly and robert blower thanks i said like a real smartass you will be defendants number three and four now why dont you leave wheres the file gasko asked the file is not here because i dont live here thats why youre going to get sued officer gasko get sued all the time no big deal great whos your attorney he couldnt pull forth the name of one in the crucial splitsecond that followed i walked to the den and they reluctantly followed leave i said the file is not here claire was nailing them with the video and that kept their bitching to a minimum blower mumbled something about lawyers as they shuffled toward the door i read the warrant after they were gone claire watched me sipping coffee at the kitchen table the shock of the search had worn off she was once again subdued even icy she would not admit to being frightened would not dare seem the least bit vulnerable and she certainly wasnt about to give the impression that she needed me in any way whats in the file she asked she didnt really want to know what claire wanted was some assurance that it wouldnt happen again its a long story in other words dont ask she understood that are you really going to sue them no there are no grounds for a suit i just wanted to get rid of them it worked can they come back no thats good to hear i folded the search warrant and stuck it in a pocket it covered only one itemthe riveroakstag file which at the moment was well hidden in the walls of my new apartment along with a copy of it did you tell them where i live i asked i dont know where you live she answered then there was a space of time during which it would have been appropriate for her to ask where in fact i did live she did not im very sorry this happened claire its okay just promise it wont happen again i promise i left without a hug a kiss a touching of any kind i simply said good night and walked through the door that was precisely what she wanted twenty tuesday was an intake day at the community for creative nonviolence or ccnv by far the largest shelter in the district once again mordecai handled the driving his plan was to accompany me for the first week then turn me loose on the city my threats and warnings to barry nuzzo had fallen on deaf ears drake and sweeney would play hardball and i wasnt surprised the predawn raid of my former apartment was a rude warning of what was to come i had to tell mordecai the truth about what id done as soon as we were in the car and moving i said my wife and i have separated ive moved out the poor guy was not prepared for such dour news at eight in the morning im sorry he said looking at me and almost hitting a jaywalker dont be early this morning the cops raided the apartment where i used to live looking for me and specifically a file i took when i left the firm what kind of file the devon hardy and lontae burton file im listening as we now know devon hardy took hostages and got himself killed because drake and sweeney evicted him from his home evicted with him were sixteen others and some children lontae and her little family were in the group he mulled this over then said this is a very small city the abandoned warehouse happened to be on land riveroaks planned to use for a postal facility its a twentymilliondollar project i know the building its always been used by squatters except they werent squatters at least i dont think so are you guessing or do you know for sure for now im guessing the file has been tampered with papers taken papers added a paralegal named hector palma handled the dirty work the site visits and the actual eviction and hes become my deep throat he sent an anonymous note informing me that the evictions were wrongful he provided me with a set of keys to get the file as of yesterday he no longer works at the office here in the district where is he id love to know he gave you keys he didnt hand them to me he left them on my desk with instructions and you used them yes to steal a file i didnt plan to steal it i was on my way to the clinic to copy it when some fool ran a red light and sent me to the hospital thats the file we retrieved from your car thats it i was going to copy it take it back to its little spot at drake and sweeney and no one would have ever known i question the wisdom of that he wanted to call me a dumbass but our relationship was still new whats missing from it he asked i summarized the history of riveroaks and its race to build the mail facility the pressure was on to grab the land fast palma went to the warehouse the first time and got mugged memo to the file he went again the second time with a guard and that memo is missing it was properly logged into the file then removed probably by braden chance so whats in the memo dont know but i have a hunch that hector inspected the warehouse found the squatters in their makeshift apartments talked to them and learned that they were in fact paying rent to tillman gantry they were not squatters but tenants entitled to all the protections under landlordtenant law by then the wrecking ball was on its way the closing had to take place gantry was about to make a killing on the deal so the memo was ignored and the eviction took place there were seventeen people yes and some children do you know the names of the others yes someone palma i suspect gave me a list placed it on my desk if we can find those people then we have witnesses maybe its more likely though that gantry has put the fear of hell in them hes a big man with a big gun fancies himself as a godfather type when he tells people to shut up they do so or you find them in a river but youre not afraid of him are you mordecai lets go find him push him around some hell break down and tell all spent a lot of time on the streets have you ive hired a dumbass hell run when he sees us the humor wasnt working at that hour neither was his heater though the fan was blowing at full speed the car was freezing how much did gantry get for the building he asked two hundred thousand hed bought it six months earlier theres no record in the file indicating how much he paid for it whod he buy it from the city it was abandoned he probably paid five thousand for it ten at the most not a bad return not bad its a step up for gantry hes been a nickel and dimerduplexes and car washes and quickshop groceries small ventures why would he buy the warehouse and rent space for cheap apartments cash lets say he pays five thousand for it then spends another thousand throwing up a few walls and installing a couple of toilets he gets the lights turned on and hes in business word gets out renters show up he charges them a hundred bucks a month payable only in cash his clients are not concerned with paperwork anyway he keeps the place looking like a dump so if the city comes in he says theyre just a bunch of squatters he promises to kick them out but he has no plans to it happens all the time around here unregulated housing i almost asked why the city didnt intervene and enforce its laws but fortunately i caught myself the answer was in the potholes too numerous to count or avoid and the fleet of police cars a third of which were too dangerous to drive and the schools with roofs caving in and the hospitals with patients stuffed in closets and the five hundred homeless mothers and children unable to find a shelter the city simply didnt work and a renegade landlord one actually getting people off the streets did not seem like a priority how do you find hector palma he asked im assuming the firm would be smart enough not to fire him they have seven other offices so i figure theyve got him tucked away somewhere ill find him we were downtown he pointed and said see those trailers stacked on top of each other thats mount vernon square it was half a city block fenced high to hinder a view from the outside the trailers were different shapes and lengths some dilapidated all grungy its the worst shelter in the city those are old postal trailers the government gave to the district which in turn had the brilliant idea of filling them with homeless theyre packed in those trailers like sardines in a can at second and d he pointed to a long threestory buildinghome to thirteen hundred people the ccnv was founded in the early seventies by a group of war protestors who had assembled in washington to torment the government they lived together in a house in northwest during their protests around the capitol they met homeless veterans of vietnam and began taking them in they moved to larger quarters various places around the city and their number grew after the war they turned their attention to the plight of the dc homeless in the early eighties an activist named mitch snyder appeared on the scene and quickly became a passionate and noisy voice for street people ccnv found an abandoned junior college one built with federal money and still owned by the government and invaded it with six hundred squatters it became their headquarters and their home various efforts were made to displace them all to no avail in snyder endured a fiftyoneday hunger strike to call attention to the neglect of the homeless with his reelection a month away president reagan boldly announced his plans to turn the building into a model shelter for the homeless snyder ended his strike everyone was happy after the election reagan reneged on his promise and all sorts of nasty litigation ensued in the city built a shelter in southeast far away from downtown and began planning the removal of the homeless from the ccnv but the city found the homeless to be an ornery lot they had no desire to leave snyder announced that they were boarding up windows and preparing for a siege rumors were rampanteight hundred street people were in there weapons were stockpiled it would be a war the city backed away from its deadlines and managed to make peace the ccnv grew to thirteen hundred beds mitch snyder committed suicide in and the city named a street after him it was almost eightthirty when we arrived time for the residents to leave many had jobs most wanted to leave for the day a hundred men loitered around the front entrance smoking cigarettes and talking the happy talk of a cold morning after a warm nights rest inside the door on the first level mordecai spoke to a supervisor in the bubble he signed his name and we walked across the lobby weaving through and around a swarm of men leaving in a hurry i tried hard not to notice my whiteness but it was impossible i was reasonably well dressed with a jacket and tie i had known affluence for my entire life and i was adrift in a sea of blackyoung tough street men most of whom had criminal records few of whom had three dollars in their pockets surely one of them would break my neck and take my wallet i avoided eye contact and frowned at the floor we waited by the intake room weapons and drugs are automatic lifetime bans mordecai said as we watched the men stream down the stairway i felt somewhat safer do you ever get nervous in here i asked you get used to it easy for him to say he spoke the language on a clipboard next to the door was a signup sheet for the legal clinic mordecai took it and we studied the names of our clients thirteen so far a little below average he said while we waited for the key he filled me in thats the post office over there one of the frustrating parts of this work is keeping up with our clients addresses are slippery the good shelters allow their people to send and receive mail he pointed to another nearby door thats the clothes room they take in between thirty and forty new people a week the first step is a medical exam tuberculosis is the current scare second step is a visit there for three sets of clothesunderwear socks everything once a month a client can come back for another suit so by the end of the year he has a decent wardrobe this is not junk they get more clothing donated than they can ever use one year thats it they boot them after one year which at first may seem harsh but it isnt the goal is selfsufficiency when a guy checks in he knows he has twelve months to clean up get sober acquire some skills and find a job most are gone in less than a year a few would like to stay forever a man named ernie arrived with an impressive ring of keys he unlocked the door to the intake room and disappeared we set up our clinic and were ready to dispense advice mordecai walked to the door with the clipboard and called out the first name luther williams luther barely fit through the door and the chair popped as he fell into it across from us he wore a green work uniform white socks and orange rubber shower sandals he worked nights at a boiler room under the pentagon a girlfriend had moved out and taken everything then run up bills he lost his apartment and was ashamed to be in the shelter i just need a break he said and i felt sorry for him he had a lot of bills credit agencies were hounding him for the moment he was hiding at ccnv lets do a bankruptcy mordecai said to me i had no idea how to do a bankruptcy i nodded with a frown luther seemed pleased we filled out forms for twenty minutes and he left a happy man the next client was tommy who slid gracefully into the room and extended a hand upon which the fingernails had been painted bright red i shook it mordecai did not tommy was in drug rehab fulltimecrack and heroinand he owed back taxes he had not filed a tax return for three years and the irs had suddenly discovered his oversights he also hadnt paid a couple of thousand in back child support i was somewhat relieved to learn he was a father of some sort the rehab was intenseseven days a weekand prevented fulltime employment you cant bankrupt the child support nor the taxes mordecai said well i cant work because of the rehab and if i drop out of rehab then ill get on drugs again so if i cant work and cant go bankrupt then what can i do nothing dont worry about it until you finish rehab and get a job then call michael brock here tommy smiled and winked at me then floated out of the room i think he likes you mordecai said ernie brought another signup sheet with eleven names on it there was a line outside the door we embraced the strategy of separation i went to the far end of the room mordecai stayed where he was and we began interiewing clients two at a time the first one for me was a young man facing a drug charge i wrote down everything so i could replay it to mordecai at the clinic next was a sight that shocked me a white man about forty with no tattoos facial scars chipped teeth earrings bloodshot eyes or red nose his beard was a week old and his head had been shaved about a month earlier when we shook hands i noticed his were soft and moist paul pelham was his name a threemonth resident of the shelter he had once been a doctor drugs divorce bankruptcy and the revocation of his license were all water under his bridge recent memories but fading fast he just wanted someone to talk to preferably someone with a white face occasionally he glanced fearfully down the table at mordecai pelham had been a prominent gynecologist in scranton pennsylvaniabig house mercedes pretty wife couple of kids first he abused valium then got addicted to harder stuff he also began sampling the delights of cocaine and the flesh of various nurses in his clinic on the side he was a real estate swinger with developments and lots of bank financing then he dropped a baby during a routine delivery it died its father a wellrespected minister witnessed the accident the humiliation of a lawsuit more drugs more nurses and everything collapsed he caught herpes from a patient gave it to his wife she got everything and moved to florida i was spellbound by his story with every client i had met so far during my brief career as a homeless lawyer i had wanted to hear the sad details of how each ended up on the streets i wanted reassurance that it couldnt happen to me that folks in my class neednt worry about such misfortune pelham was fascinating because for the first time i could look at a client and say yes perhaps that could be me life could conspire to knock down just about anyone and he was quite willing to talk about it he hinted that perhaps his trail was not cold i had listened long enough and was about to ask why exactly did he need a lawyer when he said i hid some things in my bankruptcy mordecai was shuffling clients in and out while the two white boys chatted so i began taking notes again what kind of things his bankruptcy lawyer had been crooked he said then he launched into a windy narrative about how the banks had foreclosed too early and ruined him his words were soft and low and each time mordecai glanced down at us pelham stopped and theres more he said what i asked this is confidential isnt it i mean ive used lots of lawyers but ive always paid them god knows how ive paid them its extremely confidential i said earnestly i may have been working for free but the payment or nonpayment of fees did not affect the attorneyclient privilege you cant tell a soul not a word it dawned on me that living in a homeless shelter in downtown dc with thirteen hundred others would be a wonderful way to hide this seemed to satisfy him when i was rolling he said even quieter i found out that my wife was seeing another man one of my patients told me when you examine naked women theyll tell you everything i was devastated i hired a private detective and sure enough it was true the other man well lets say that he just disappeared one day he stopped and waited for me to respond disappeared yep has never been seen since is he dead i asked stunned he nodded slightly do you know where he is another nod how long ago was this four years my hand shook as i tried to write down everything he leaned forward and whispered he was an fbi agent an old boyfriend from collegepenn state come on i said completely uncertain if he were telling the truth theyre after me who the fbi theyve been chasing me for four years what do you want me to do i dont know maybe cut a deal im tired of being stalked i analyzed this for a moment as mordecai finished with a client and called for another pelham watched every move he made ill need some information i said do you know the agents name yep i know when and where he was born and when and where he died yep he had no notes or papers with him why dont you come to my office bring the information we can talk there let me think about it he said looking at his watch he explained that he worked parttime as a janitor in a church and he was late we shook hands and he left i was rapidly learning that one of the challenges of being a street lawyer was to be able to listen many of my clients just wanted to talk to someone all had been kicked and beaten down in some manner and since free legal advice was available why not unload on the lawyers mordecai was a master at gently poking through the narratives and determining if there was an issue for him to pursue i was still awed by the fact that people could be so poor i was also learning that the best case was one that could be handled on the spot with no followup i had a notebook filled with applications for food stamps housing assistance medicare social security cards even drivers licenses when in doubt we filled out a form twentysix clients passed through our session before noon we left exhausted lets take a walk mordecai said when we were outside file building the sky was clear the air cold and windy and refreshing after three hours in a stuffy room with no windows across the street was the us tax court a handsome modem building in fact the ccnv was surrounded by much nicer structures of more recent construction we stopped at the comer of second and d and looked at the shelter their lease expires in four years mordecai said the real estate vultures are already circling a new convention center is planned two blocks over thatll be a nasty fight itll be a war we crossed the street and strolled toward the capitol that white guy whats his story mordecai asked pelham had been the only white guy amazing i said not sure where to start he was once a doctor up in pennsylvania whos chasing him now what whos chasing him now fbi thats nice last time it was the cia my feet stopped moving his did not youve seen him before yeah he makes the rounds peter something or other paul pelham that changes too he said over his shoulder tells a great story doesnt he i couldnt speak i stood there watching mordecai walk away hands deep in his trench coat his shoulders shaking because he was laughing so hard twentyone when i mustered the courage to explain to mordecai that i needed the afternoon off he very brusquely informed me that my standing was equal to the rest that no one monitored my hours and that if i needed time off then i should damned well take it i left the office in a hurry only sofia seemed to notice i spent an hour with the claims adjuster the lexus was a total wreck my company was offering with a release so it could then go after the insurer of the jaguar i owed the bank so i left with a check for and change certainly enough to buy a suitable vehicle one appropriate to my new position as a poverty lawyer and one that wouldnt tempt car thieves another hour was wasted in the reception area of my doctor as a busy attorney with a cell phone and many clients i stewed as i sat among the magazines and listened to the clock tick a nurse made me strip to my boxers and i sat for twenty minutes on a cold table the bruises were turning dark brown the doctor poked and made things worse then pronounced me good for another two weeks i arrived at claires lawyers office promptly at four and was met by an unsmiling receptionist dressed like a man bitchiness resonated from every corner of the place every sound was antimale the abrupt husky voice of the gal answering the phone the sounds of some female country crooner wafting through the speakers the occasional shrill voice from down the hall the colors were soft pastel lavender and pink and beige the magazines on the coffee table were there to make a statement hardhitting female issues nothing glamorous or gossipy they were to be admired by the visitors not read jacqueline hume had first made a ton of money cleaning out wayward doctors then had created a fierce reputation by destroying a couple of philandering senators her name struck fear into every unhappily married dc male with a nice income i was anxious to sign the papers and leave instead i was allowed to wait for thirty minutes and was on the verge of creating a nasty scene when an associate fetched me and led me to an office down the hall she handed me the separation agreement and for the first time i saw the reality the heading was claire addison brock versus michael nelson brock the law required us to be separated for six months before we could be divorced i read the agreement carefully signed it and left by thanksgiving i would be officially single again my fourth stop of the afternoon was the parking lot of drake and sweeney where polly met me at precisely five with two storage boxes filled with the remaining souvenirs from my office she was polite and efficient but tightlipped and of course in a hurry they probably had her wired i walked several blocks and stopped at a busy corner leaning on a building i dialed barry nuzzos number he was in a meeting as usual i gave my name said it was an emergency and within thirty seconds barry was on the phone can we talk i asked i assumed the call was being recorded sure im just down the street at the corner of k and connecticut lets have coffee i can be there in an hour no its right now or forget it i didnt want the boys to be able to plot and scheme no time for wires either okay lets see yeah all right i can do it im at a binglers coffee i know it im waiting and come alone youve been watching too many movies mike ten minutes later we were sitting in front of the window of a crowded little shop holding hot coffee and watching the foot traffic on connecticut why the search warrant i asked its our file you have it we want it back very simple youre not going to find it okay so stop the damned searches where do you live now i grunted and gave him my best smartass laugh the arrest warrant usually follows the search warrant i said is that the way its going to happen im not at liberty to say thanks pal look michael lets start with the premise that youre wrong youve taken something thats not yours thats stealing plain and simple and in doing so youve become an adversary of the firms i your friend still work for the firm you cant expect me to help you when your actions may be damaging to the firm you created this mess not me braden chance is not telling everything the guys a worm an arrogant little jerk who committed malpractice and now hes trying to cover his ass he wants you to think its a simple matter of a stolen file and that its safe to come after me but the file can humiliate the firm so whats your point lay off dont do anything stupid like get you arrested yeah for starters ive been looking over my shoulder all day and its no fun you shouldnt steal i didnt plan to steal okay i borrowed the file i planned to copy and return it but i never made it so you finally admit you have it yeah but i can deny it too youre playing michael and this is not a game youre gonna get yourself hurt not if you guys lay off just for now lets have a truce for a week no more search warrants no arrests okay and what are you offering i wont embarrass the firm with the file barry shook his head and gulped hot coffee im not in a position to make deals im just a lowly associate is arthur calling the shots of course then tell arthur im talking only to you youre assuming too much michael youre assuming the firm wants to talk to you frankly they dont they are highly agitated by the theft of the file and by your refusal to return it you cant blame them get their attention barry this file is frontpage news big bold headlines with noisy journalists following up with a dozen stories if i get arrested ill go straight to the post youve lost your mind probably so chance had a paralegal named hector palma have you heard of him no youre out of the loop i never claimed to be in palma knows too much about the file as of yesterday he no longer works where he worked last week i dont know where he is but it would be interesting to find out ask arthur just give the file back michael i dont know what youre planning to do with it but you cant use it in couurt i took my coffee and stepped off the stool a truce for one week i said walking away and tell arthur to put you in the loop arthur doesnt take orders from you he snapped at me i left quickly darting through people on the sidewalk practically running toward dupont circle anxious to leave barry behind and anyone else theyd sent along to spy the palmas address according to the phone book was an apartment building in bethesda since i was in no hurry and needed to think i circled the city on the beltway bumper to bumper with a million others i gave myself fiftyfifty odds of being arrested within the week the firm had no choice but to come after me and if braden chance was in fact hiding the truth from arthur and the executive committee then why not play hardball there was enough circumstantial evidence of my theft to convince a magistrate to issue an arrest warrant the mister episode had rattled the firm chance had been called onto the carpet grilled at length by the brass and it was inconceivable that he admitted any deliberate wrongdoing he lied and he did so with the hope that he could doctor the file and somehow survive his victims after all were only a bunch of homeless squatters how then was he able to dispose of hector so quickly money was no objectchance was a partner if i had been chance i wouldve offered cash to hector cash on one hand with the threat of immediate termination on the other and i wouldve called a partner buddy in say denver and asked for a favora quick transfer for a paralegal it would not have been difficult hector was away hiding from me and anyone else who came with questions he was still employed probably at a higher salary then what about the polygraph had it been simply a threat used by the firm against both hector and my self could he have taken the test and passed i doubted it chance needed hector to keep the truth hidden hector needed chance to protect his job at some point the partner blocked any notion of a polygraph if in fact it had been seriously considered the apartment complex was long and rambling new sections added as the sprawl moved northward away from file city the streets around it were packed with fast food fast gas video rentals everything hurried commuters needed to save time i parked next to some tennis courts and began a tour of the various units i took my time there was no place to go after this adventure district cops could be lurking anywhere with a warrant and handcuffs i tried not to think of the horror stories id heard about the city jail but one stuck like a cattle brand seared into my memory several years earlier a young drake and sweeney associate spent several hours after work on friday drinking in a bar in georgetown as he was trying to get to virginia he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence at the police station he refused a breath test and was immediately thrown into the drunk tank the cell was overcrowded he was the only guy with a suit the only guy with a nice watch fine loafers white face he accidentally stepped on the foot of a fellow inmate and he was then beaten to a bloody mess he spent three months in a hospital getting his face rebuilt then went home to wilmington where his family took care of him the brain damage was slight but enough to disqualify him for the rigors of a big firm the first office was closed i trudged along a sidewalk in search of another the phone address did not list an apartment number it was a safe complex there were bikes and plastic toys on the small patios through the windows i could see families eating and watching television the windows were not defended by rows of bars the cars crammed into the parking lots were of the midsized commuter variety mostly clean and with all four hubcaps a security guard stopped me once he determined that i posed no threat he pointed in the direction of the main office at least a quarter of a mile away how many units are in this place i asked a lot he answered why should he know the number the night manager was a student eating a sandwich a physics textbook opened before him but he was watching the bulletsknicks game on a small tv i asked about hector palma and he pecked away on a keyboard g was the number but theyve moved he said with a mouthful of food yeah i know i said i worked with hector friday was his last day im looking for an apartment and i was wondering if i could see his he was shaking his head no before i finished only on saturdays man we have nine hundred units and theres a waiting list im gone on saturday sorry he said taking another bite and glancing at the game i removed my wallet how many bedrooms i asked he glanced at the monitor two hector had four children i was sure his new digs were more spacious how much a month sevenfifty i took out a onehundreddollar bill which he immediately saw heres the deal give me the key ill take a look at the place and be back in ten minutes no one will ever know we have a waiting list he said again dropping the sandwich onto a paper plate is it there in that computer i asked pointing yeah he said wiping his mouth then it would be easy to shuffle he found the key in a locked drawer and grabbed the money ten minutes he said the apartment was nearby on the ground floor of a threestory building the key worked the smell of fresh paint escaped through the door before i went inside in fact the painting was still in progress in the living room there was a ladder dropcloths white buckets a team of fingerprinters could not have found a trace of the palma clan all drawers cabinets and closets were bare all carpets and padding ripped up and gone even the tub and toilet bowl stains had been removed no dust cobwebs dirt under the kitchen sink the place was sterile every room had a fresh coat of dull white except the living room which was halffinished i returned to the office and tossed the key on the counter how about it he asked too small i said but thanks anyway you want your money back are you in school yes then keep it thanks i stopped at the door and asked did palma leave a forwarding address i thought you worked with him he said right i said and quickly closed the door behind me twentytwo the little woman was sitting against our door when i arrived for work wednesday morning it was almost eight the office was locked the temperature was below freezing at first i thought she had parked herself there for the night using our doorway to battle the wind but when she saw me approach she immediately jumped to her feet and said good morning i smiled said hello and started fumbling keys are you a lawyer she asked yes i am for people like me i assumed she was homeless and that was all we asked of our clients sure be my guest i said as i opened the door it was colder inside than out i adjusted a thermostat one that as far as i had been able to determine was connected to nothing i made coffee and found some stale doughnuts in the kitchen i offered them to her and she quickly ate one whats your name i asked we were sitting in the front next to sofias desk waiting for the coffee and praying for the radiators ruby im michael where do you live ruby here and there she was dressed in a gray georgetown hoya sweat suit thick brown socks dirty white sneakers with no brand name she was between thirty and forty railthin and slightly cockeyed come on i said with a smile i need to know where you live is it a shelter used to live in a shelter but had to leave almost got raped i got a car i had seen no vehicles parked near the office when i arrived you have a car yes do you drive it it dont drive i sleep in the back i was asking questions without a legal pad something i was not trained to do i poured two large paper cups of coffee and we retreated to my office where mercifully the radiator was alive and gurgling i closed the door mordecai would arrive shortly and he had never learned the art of a quiet entry ruby sat on the edge of my brown folding clients chair her shoulders slumped her entire upper body wrapped around the cup of coffee as if it might be the last warm thing in life what can i do for you i asked armed with a full assortment of legal pads its my son terrence hes sixteen and theyve taken him away who took him the city the foster people where is he now they got him her answers were short nervous bursts quick on the heels of each question why dont you relax and tell me about terrence i said and she did with no effort at eye contact and with both hands on the coffee cup she zipped through her narrative several years earlier she couldnt remember how long but terrence was around ten they were living alone in a small apartment she was arrested for selling drugs she went to jail for four months terrence went to live with her sister upon her release she collected terrence and they began a nightmare existence living on the streets they slept in cars squatted in empty buildings slept under bridges in warm weather and retreated to the shelters when it was cold somehow she kept him in school she begged on the sidewalks she sold her bodytricking as she called it she peddled a little crack she did whatever it took to keep terrence fed in decent clothes and in school but she was an addict and couldnt kick the crack she became pregnant and when the child was born the city took it immediately it was a crack baby she seemed to have no affection for the baby only for terrence the city began asking questions about him and mother and child slid deeper into the shadows of the homeless out of desperation she went to a family she had once worked for as a maid the rowlands a couple whose children were grown and away from home they had a warm little house near howard university she offered to pay them fifty dollars a month if terrence could live with them there was a small bedroom above the back porch one shed cleaned many times and it would be perfect for terrence the rowlands hesitated at first but finally agreed they were good people back then ruby was allowed to visit terrence for an hour each night his grades improved he was clean and safe and ruby was pleased with herself she rearranged her life around his new soup kitchens and dinner programs closer to the rowlands different shelters for emergencies different alleys and parks and abandoned cars she scraped together the money each month and never missed a nightly visit with her son until she was arrested again the first arrest was for prostitution the second was for sleeping on a park bench in farragut square maybe there was a third one but she couldnt remember she was rushed to dc general once when someone found her lying in a street unconscious she was placed in a dryout tank for addicts but walked out after three days because she missed terrence she was with him one night in his room when he stared at her stomach and asked if she was pregnant again she said she thought so who was the father he demanded she had no idea he cursed her and yelled so much that the rowlands asked her to leave while she was pregnant terrence had little to do with her it was heartbreakingsleeping in cars begging for coins counting the hours until she could see him then being ignored for an hour while she sat in a corner of his room watching him do his homework ruby began crying at that point in her story i made t some notes and listened as mordecai stomped around the front room trying to pick a fight with sofia her third delivery only a year before produced another crack baby one immediately taken by the city i she didnt see terrence for four days while she was in the hospital recovering from the birth when she was released she returned to the only life she knew terrence was an a student excellent in math and spanish a trombone player and an actor in school dramas he was dreaming of the naval academy mr rowland had served in the military ruby arrived one night for a visit in bad shape a fight started in the kitchen when mrs rowland con fronted her harsh words were exchanged ultimatums thrown down terrence was in the middle of it three against one either she got help or she would be banned from the house ruby declared that she would simply take her boy and leave terrence said he wasnt going anywhere the next night a social worker from the city was waiting for her with paperwork someone had already been to court terrence was being taken into foster care the rowlands would be his new parents he had already lived with them for three years visitation would be terminated until she underwent rehab and was clean for a period of sixty days three weeks had passed i want to see my son she said i miss him so bad are you in rehab i asked she shook her head quickly and closed her eyes why not i asked cant get in i had no idea how a crack addict off the street got admitted to a recovery unit but it was time to find out i pictured terrence in his warm room well fed well dressed safe clean sober doing his homework under the strict supervision of mr and mrs rowland who had grown to love him almost as much as ruby did i could see him eating breakfast at the family table reciting vocabulary lists over hot cereal as mr rowland ignored the morning paper and grilled him on his spanish terrence was stable and normal unlike my poor little client who lived in hell and she wanted me to handle their reunion this will take some time okay i said thoroughly clueless about how long anything would take in a city where five hundred families waited for a small space in an emergency shelter there couldnt be many beds available for drug addicts you wont see terrence until youre drugfree i said trying not to sound pious her eyes watered and she said nothing i realized just how little i knew about addiction where did she get her drugs how much did they cost how many hits and highs each day how long would it take to dry her out then to cure her what were her chances of kicking a habit shed had for over a decade and what did the city do with all those crack babies she had no paperwork no address no identification nothing but a heartbreaking story she seemed perfectly content sitting in my chair and i began to wonder how i might ask her to leave the coffee was gone sofias shrill voice brought back reality there were sharp voices around her as i raced for the door my first thought was that another nut like mister had walked in with a gun but there were other guns lieutenant gasko was back again with plenty of help three uniformed cops were approaching sofia who was bitching unmercifully but to no avail two in jeans and sweatshirts were waiting for action as i walked out of my office mordecai walked out of his hello mikey gasko said to me what the hell is this mordecai growled and the walls shook one of the uniformed cops actually reached for his service revolver gasko went straight for mordecai its a search he said pulling out the required papers and flinging them at mordecai are you mr green i am he answered snatching the papers what are you looking for i yelled at gasko same thing he yelled back give it to us and well be happy to stop its not here what file mordecai asked looking at the search warrant the eviction file i replied havent seen your lawsuit gasko said to me i recognized two of the uniformed cops as lilly and blower a iotta big talk gasko said get the hell outta here sofia barked at blower as he inched toward her desk gasko was very much in charge listen lady he said with his usual sneer we can do this two ways first you put your ass in that chair and shut up second we put the cuffs on you and you sit in the back of a car for the next two hours one cop was poking his head into each of the side offices i felt ruby ease behind me relax mordecai said to sofia just relax whats upstairs gasko asked me storage mordecai replied your storage yes its not there i said youre wasting your time then well have to waste it wont we a prospective client opened the front door startling those of us inside his eyes darted quickly around the room then settled on the three men in uniform he made a hasty retreat into the safety of the streets i asked ruby to leave too then i stepped into mordecais office and closed the door wheres the file he asked in a low voice its not here i swear this is just harassment the warrant looks valid theres been a theft its reasonable to assume the file would be with the attorney who stole it i tried to say something lawyerly and bright some piercing legal nugget that would stop the search cold and send the cops running but words failed me hstead i was embarrassed at having brought the police to nose through the clinic do you have a copy of the file he asked yes have you thought about giving them their original i cant that would be an admission of guilt they dont know for a fact that i have the file and even if i gave it back they would know that i had copied it he rubbed his beard and agreed with me we stepped out of his office just as lilly missed a step near the unused desk next to sofias an avalanche of files slid onto the floor sofia yelled at him gasko yelled at her the tension was quickly moving away from words and in the direction of physical conflict i locked the front door so our clients wouldnt see the search heres the way well do it mordecai announced the cops glared but they were anxious for some direction searching a law office was quite unlike raiding a bar filled with millors the file isnt here okay well start with that promise you can look at all the files you want but you cant open them that would violate client confidentiality agreed the other cops looked at gasko who shrugged as if that was acceptable we started in my office all six cops me and mordecai crammed into the tiny room working hard at avoiding contact i opened each drawer of my desk none of which would open unless yanked viciously at one point i heard gasko whisper to himself nice office i removed each file from my cabinets waved them under gaskos nose and returned them to their place id only been there since monday so there wasnt much to search mordecai slipped from the room and went to sofias desk where he used the phone when gasko declared my office to be officially searched we left it just in time to hear mordecai say into the receiver yes judge thank you hes right here his smile showed every tooth as he thrust the phone at gasko this is judge kisner the gentleman who signed the search warrant he would like to speak to you gasko took the phone as if it were owned by a leper this is gasko he said holding it inches from his head mordecai turned to the other cops gentlemen you may search this room and thats it you cannot go into the private offices to the sides judges orders gasko mumbled yes sir and hung up we monitored their movements for an hour as they went from desk to deskfour of them in all including sofias after a few minutes they realized the search was futile and so they prolonged it by moving as slowly as possible each desk was covered with files long since closed the books and legal publications had last been looked at years earlier some stacks were covered with dust a few cobwebs had to be dealt with each file was tabbed with the case name either typed or handprinted two of the cops wrote down the names of the files as they were called out by gasko and the others it was tedious and utterly hopeless they saved sofias desk for last she handled things herself calling off the name of each file spelling the simpler ones like jones smith williams the cops kept their distance she opened drawers just wide enough for a quick peek she had a personal drawer which no one wanted to see i was sure there were weapons in there they left without saying goodbye i apologized to sofia and mordecai for the intrusion and retreated to the safety of my office twentythree number five on the list of evictees was kelvin lam a name vaguely familiar to mordecai he once estimated the number of homeless in the district to be around ten thousand there were at least that many files scattered throughout the th street legal clinic every name rang a bell with mordecai he worked the circuits the kitchens and shelters and service providers the preachers and cops and other street lawyers after dark we drove downtown to a church wedged between highpriced office buildings and ritzy hotels in a large basement two levels below the five loaves dinner program was in full swing the room was lined with folding tables all surrounded by hungry folks eating and talking it was not a soup kitchen the plates were filled with corn potatoes a slice of something that was either turkey or chicken fruit salad bread i had not eaten dinner and the aroma made me hungry i havent been here in years mordecai said as we stood by the entrance looking down at the dining area they feed three hundred a day isnt it wonderful where does the food come from dc central kitchen an outfit in the basement of the ccnv theyve developed this amazing system of collecting excess food from local restaurants not leftovers but uncooked food that will simply go bad if not used immediately they have a fleet of refrigerated trucks and they run all over the city collecting food which they take to the kitchen and prepare frozen dinners over two thousand a day it looks tasty its really quite good a young lady named liza found us she was new at five loaves mordecai had known her predecessor whom they talked about briefly as i watched the people eat i noticed something i should have seen before there were different levels of homelessness distinct rungs on the socioeconomic ladder at one table six men ate and talked happily about a basketball game they had seen on television they were reasonably well dressed one wore gloves while he ate and except for that the group couldve been sitting in any workingclass bar in the city without being immediately branded as homeless behind them a hulking figure with thick sunglasses ate alone handling the chicken with his fingers he had robber boots similar to the ones mister wore at the time of his death his coat was dirty and frayed he was oblivious to his surroundings his life was noticeably harder than the lives of the men laughing at the next table they had access to warm water and soap he couldnt have cared less they slept in shelters he slept in parks with the pigeons but they were all homeless liza did not know kelvin lam but she would ask around we watched her as she moved through the crowd speaking to the people pointing to the wastebaskets in one corner fussing over an elderly lady she sat between two men neither of whom looked at her as they talked she went to another table then another most surprisingly a lawyer appeared a young associate from a large firm a pro bono volunteer with the washington legal clinic for the homeless he recognized mordecai from a fundraiser the year before we did law talk for a few minutes then he disappeared into a back room to begin three hours of intake the washington legal clinic has a hundred and fifty volunteers mordecai said is that enough i asked its never enough i think we should revive our pro bono volunteer program maybe youd like to take charge and supervise it abraham likes the idea it was nice to know that mordecai and abraham and no doubt sofia too had been discussing a program for me to run it will expand our base make us more visible in the legal community and help with raising money sure i said without conviction liza was back kelvin lam is in the rear she said nodding second table from the back wearing the redskins cap did you talk to him mordecai asked yes hes sober pretty sharp said hes been staying at ccnv works parttime on a garbage truck is there a small room we can use sure tell lam a homeless lawyer needs to talk to him lam didnt say hello or offer to shake hands mordecai sat at a table i stood in a corner lam took the only available chair and gave me a look that made my skin crawl nothings wrong mordecai said in his best soothing tone we need to ask you a few questions thats all not a peep out of lam he was dressed like a resident of a shelterjeans sweatshirt sneakers wool jacketas opposed to the pungent multilayered garb of one sleeping under a bridge do you know a woman named lontae burton mordecai asked he would do the talking for us lawyers lam shook his head no devon hardy another no last month were you living in an abandoned warehouse yep at the corner of new york and florida uhhuh were you paying rent yep a hundred dollars a month yep to tillman gantry lam froze and closed his eyes to ponder the question who he asked who owned the warehouse i paid rent to some dude named johnny who did johnny work for dont know dont care didnt ask how long did you live there bout four months why did you leave got evicted who evicted you i dont know the cops showed up one day with some other dudes they yanked us and threw us on the sidewalk couple of days later they bulldozed the warehouse did you explain to the cops that you were paying rent to live there a lot of people were saying that this one woman with little kids tried to fight with the police but didnt do no good me i dont fight with cops it was a bad scene man were you given any paperwork before the eviction no any notice to get out no nothing they just showed up nothing in writing nothing cops said we were just squatters had to get out right then so you moved in last fall sometime around october something like that how did you find the place i dont know somebody said they were renting little apartments in the warehouse cheap rent you know so i went over to check it out they were putting up some boards and walls and things there was a roof up there a toilet not far away running water it wasnt a bad deal so you moved in right did you sign a lease no dude told me that the apartment was illegal so nothing was in writing told me to say i was squatting in case anybody asked and he wanted cash only cash did you pay every month tried to he came around on the fifteenth to collect were you behind on your rent when you were evicted a little how much maybe one month was that the reason you were evicted i dont know they didnt give no reason they just evicted everybody all at once did you know the other people in the warehouse i knew a couple but we kept to ourselves each aparmtent had a good door one that would lock this mother you mentioned the one who fought with the police did you know her no id maybe seen her once or twice she lived on the other end the other end right there was no plumbing in the middle of the warehouse so they built the apartments on each end could you see her apartment from yours no it was a big warehouse how big was your apartment two rooms i dont know how big electricity yeah they ran some wires in we could plug in radios and things like that we had lights there was running water but you had to use a community toilet what about heating not much it got cold but not nearly as cold as sleeping on the street so you were happy with the place it was okay i mean for a hundred bucks a month it wasnt bad you said you knew two other people what are their names herman harris and shine somebody where are they now i havent seen them where are you staying ccnv mordecai pulled a business card from his pocket and handed it to lam how long will you be there he asked i dont know can you keep in touch with me why you might need a lawyer just call me if you change shelters or find a place of your own lam took the card without a word we thanked liza and returned to the office as with any lawsuit there were a number of ways to proceed with our action against the defendants there were three of themriveroaks drake and sweeney and tag and we did not expect to add more the first method was the ambush the other was the serve and volley with the ambush we would prepare the skeletal framework of our allegations run to the courthouse file the suit leak it to the press and hope we could prove what we thought we knew the advantage was surprise and embarrassment for the defendants and hopefully public opinion the downside was the legal equivalent of jumping off a cliff with the strong but unconfirmed belief that there was a net down there somewhere the serve and volley would begin with a letter to the defendants in which we made the same allegations but rather than sue we would invite them to discuss the matter the letters would go back and forth with each side generally able to predict what the other might do if liability could be proved then a quiet settlement would probably occur litigation could be avoided the ambush appealed to mordecai and myself for two reasons the firm had shown no interest in leaving me alone the two searches were clear proof that arthur on the top floor and rafter and his band of hardasses in litigation were coming after me my arrest would make a nice news story one they would undoubtedly leak to humiliate me and build pressure we had to be ready with our own assault the second reason went to the heart of our case hector and the other witnesses could not be compelled to testify until we filed suit and forced them to give their depositions during the discovery period that followed the initial filing we would have the opportunity to ask all sorts of questions of the defendants and they would be required to answer under oath we would also be allowed to depose anybody we wanted if we found hector palma we could grill him under oath if we tracked down the other evictees we could force them to tell what happened we had to find out what everyone knew and there was no way to do this without using courtsanctioned discovery in theory our case was really quite simple the warehouse squatters had been paying rent in cash with no records to tillman gantry or someone working on his behalf gantry had an opportunity to sell the property to riveroaks but it had to be done quickly gantry lied to riveroaks and its lawyers about the squatters drake and sweeney exercising diligence had sent hector palma to inspect the property prior to closing hector was mugged on the first visit took a guard with him on the second and upon inspecting the premises learned that the residents were in fact not squatters but tenants he reported this in a memo to braden chance who made the illfated decision to disregard it and proceed with the closing the tenants were summarily evicted as squatters without due process a formal eviction would have taken at least thirty more days time none of the participants wanted to waste thirty days and the worst of winter would be gone the threat of snowstorms or subzero nights would be diminished along with the need to sleep in a car with the heater running they were just street people with no records no rent receipts and no trail to be followed it was not a complicated case in theory but the hurdles were enormous locking in testimony of homeless people could be treacherous especially if mr gantry decided to assert himself he ruled the streets an arena i was not eager to fight in mordecai had a vast network built on favors and whispers but he was no match for gantrys artillery we spent an hour discussing various ways to avoid naming tag inc as a defendant for obvious reasons the lawsuit would be far messier and more dangerous with gantry as a party we could sue without him and leave it to his codefendantsriveroaks and drake and sweeneyto haul him in as a third party but gantry was a contributing cause in our theory of liability and to ignore him as a defendant would be to ask for trouble as the case progressed hector palma had to be found and once we found him we somehow had to convince him to either produce the hidden memo or to tell us what was in it finding him would be the easy part getting him to talk might be impossible he quite likely wouldnt want to since he needed to keep his job hed been quick to tell me he had a wife and four kids there were other problems with the lawsuit the first of which was purely procedural we as lawyers did not have the authority to file suit on behalf of the heirs of lontae burton and her four children we had to be employed by her family such as it was with her mother and two brothers in prison and her fathers identity yet to be revealed mordecai was of the opinion we should petition the family court for the appointment of a trustee to handle the affairs of lontaes estate in doing so we could bypass her family at least initially in the event we recovered damages the family would be a nightmare it was safe to assume that the four children had two or more different fathers and each one of those tomcats would have to be notified if money changed hands well worry about that later mordecai said we have to win first we were in the front at the desk next to sofias where the aging computer worked most of the time i was typing mordecai pacing and dictating we plotted until midnight drafting and redrafting the lawsuit arguing theories discussing procedure dreaming of ways to haul riveroaks and my old firm into court for a noisy trial mordecai saw it as a watershed a pivotal moment to reverse the decline in public sympathy for the homeless i saw it simply as a way to correct a wrong twentyfour coffee again with ruby she was waiting by the front door when i arrived at seven fortyfive happy to see me how could anyone be so cheerful after spending eight hours trying to sleep in the backseat of an abandoned car got any doughnuts she asked as i was flipping on the light switches it was already a habit ill see you have a seat and ill make us some coffee i rattled around the kitchen cleaning the coffeepot looking for something to eat yesterdays stale doughnuts were even firmer but there was nothing else i made a mental note to buy fresh ones tomorrow just in case ruby arrived for the third day in a row something told me she would she ate one doughnut nibbling around the hard edges trying to be polite where do you eat breakfast i asked dont usually how about lunch and dinner lunch is at naomis on tenth street for dinner i go to calvary mission over on fifteenth what do you do during the day she was curled around her paper cup again trying to keep her frail body warm most of the time i stay at naomis she said how many women are there dont know a lot they take good care of us but its just for the day is it only for homeless women yeah thats right they close at four most of the women live in shelters some on the street me i got a car do they know youre using crack i think so they want me to go to meetings for drunks and people on dope im not the only one lots of the women do it too you know did you get high last night i asked the words echoed in my ears i found it hard to believe i was asking such questions her chin fell to her chest her eyes closed tell me the truth i said i had to i do it every night i wasnt about to scold her i had done nothing since the day before to help her find treatment it suddenly became my priority she asked for another doughnut i wrapped the last one in foil and topped off her coffee she was late for something at naomis and off she went the march began at the district building with a rally for justice since mordecai was a whos who in the world of the homeless he left me in the crowd and went to his spot on the platform a church choir robed in burgundy and gold got organized on the steps and began flooding the area with lively hymns hundreds of police loitered in loose formation up and down the street their barricades stopping traffic the ccnv had promised a thousand of its foot soldiers and they arrived in a groupone long impressive disorganized column of men homeless and proud of it i heard them coming before i saw them their wellrehearsed marching yells clear from blocks away when they rounded the corner the tv cameras scrambled to greet them they gathered intact before the steps of the district building and began waving their placards most of which were of the homemade handpainted variety stop the killings save the shelters i have the right to a home jobs jobs jobs the signs were hoisted above their heads where they danced with the rhythm of the hymns and the cadence of each noisy chant church buses stopped at the barricades and unloaded hundreds of people many of whom did not appear to be living on the streets they were nicely dressed church folk almost all women the crowd swelled the space around me shrunk i did not know a single person other than mordecai sofia and abraham were somewhere in the crowd but i didnt see them it was billed as the largest homeless march in the past ten yearslontaes rally a photo of lontae burton had been enlarged and massproduced on large placards trimmed in black and under her face were the ominous words wio li er koriv these were dispersed through the crowd and quickly became the placard of choice even among the men from the ccnv whod brought their own protest banners lontaes face bobbed and weaved above the mass of people a lone siren wailed in the distance then grew closer a funeral van with a police escort was allowed through the barricades and stopped directly in front of the district building in the midst of the throng the rear doors opened a mock casket painted black was removed by the pallbearerssix homeless men who lifted it onto their shoulders and stood ready to begin the procession four more caskets same color and make but much smaller were removed by more pallbearers the sea parted the procession moved slowly toward the steps as the choir launched into a soulful requiem that almost brought tears to my eyes it was a death march one of those little caskets represented ontario then the crowd pressed together hands reached upward and touched the caskets so that they floated along rocking gently side to side end to end it was high drama and the cameras packed near the platform recorded every solemn movement of the procession we would see it replayed on tv for the next fortyeight hours the caskets were placed side by side with lontaes in the middle on a small plywood ledge in the center of the steps a few feet below the platform where mordecai stood they were filmed and photographed at length then the speeches started the moderator was an activist who began by thanking all the groups that had helped organize the march it was an impressive list at least in quantity as he rattled off the names i was pleasantly surprised at the sheer number of shelters missions kitchens coalitions medical clinics legal clinics churches centers outreach groups jobtraining programs substanceabuse programs even a few elected officialsall responsible to some degree for the event with so much support how could there be a homeless problem the next six speakers answered that question lack of adequate funding to begin with then budget cuts a deaf ear by the federal government a blind eye by the city a lack of compassion from those with means a court system grown much too conservative the list went on and on and on and on the same themes were repeated by each speaker except for mordecai who spoke fifth and silenced the crowd with his story of the last hours of the burton family when he told of changing the babys diaper probably its last one there wasnt a sound in the crowd not a cough or a whisper i looked at the caskets as if one actually held the baby then the family left the shelter he explained his voice slow deep resonating they went back into the streets into the snowstorm where lontae and her children survived only a few more hours mordecai took great license with the facts at that point because no one knew exactly what had happened i knew this but i didnt care the rest of the crowd was equally mesmerized by his story when he described the last moments as the family huddled together in a futile effort to stay warm i heard women crying around me my thoughts turned selfish if this man my friend and fellow lawyer could captivate a crowd of thousands from an elevated platform a hundred feet away what could he do with twelve people in a jury box close enough to touch i realized at that moment that the burton lawsuit would never get that far no defense team in its right mind would allow mordecai green to preach to a black jury in this city if our assumptions were correct and if we could prove them there would never be a trial after an hour and a half of speeches the crowd was restless and ready to walk the choir began again and the caskets were lifted by the pallbearers who led the procession away from the building behind the caskets were the leaders including mordecai the rest of us followed someone handed me a lontae placard and i held it as high as anyone else privileged people dont march and protest their world is safe and clean and governed by laws designed to keep them happy i had never taken to the streets before why bother and for the first block or two i felt odd walking in a mass of people holding a stick with a placard bearing the face of a twentytwoyearold black mother who bore four illegitimate children but i was no longer the same person id been a few weeks earlier nor could i go back even if id wanted to my past had been about money and possessions and status afflictions that now disturbed me and so i relaxed and enjoyed the walk i chanted with the homeless rolled and pitched my placard in perfect unison with the others and even tried to sing hymns foreign to me i savored my first exercise in civil protest it wouldnt be my last the barricades protected us as we inched toward capitol hill the march had been well planned and because of its size it attracted attention along the way the caskets were placed on the steps of the capitol we congregated in a mass around them then listened to another series of fiery speeches from civil rights activists and two members of congress the speeches grew old id heard enough my homeless brethren had little to do i had opened thirtyone files since beginning my new career on monday thirtyone real people were waiting for me to get food stamps locate housing file divorces defend criminal charges obtain disputed wages stop evictions help with their addictions and in some way snap my fingers and find justice as an antitrust lawyer i rarely had to face the clients things were different on the street i bought a cheap cigar from a sidewalk vendor and went for a short walk on the mall twentyfive i knocked on the door next to where the palmas had lived and a womans voice asked whos there there was no effort to unbolt and open i had thought long and hard about my ploy id even rehearsed it driving to bethesda but i was not convinced i could be convincing bob stevens i said cringing im looking for hector palma who she asked hector palma he used to live next door to you what do you want i owe him some money im trying to find him thats all if i were collecting money or had some other unpleasant mission then the neighbors would naturally be defensive i thought this was a nifty little ruse hes gone she said flatly i know hes gone do you know where he went no did he leave this area dont know did you see them move of course the answer was yes there was no way around it but instead of being helpful she withdrew into the depths of her apartment and probably called security i repeated the question then rang the doorbell again nothing so i went to the door on the other side of hectors lastknown address two tings it opened shghtly until the chain caught and a man my age with mayonnaise in the corner of his mouth said what do you want i repeated the bob stevens plot he listened carefully while his kids romped through the living room behind him a television blasting away it was after eight dark and cold and id interrupted a late dinner but he was not unpleasant i never knew him he said what about his wife nope i travel a lot gone most of the time did your wife know them no he said this too quickly did you or your wife see them move we werent here last weekend and you have no idea where they went none i thanked him then turned around to meet a beefy security guard in uniform holding a billy club with his right hand and tapping it on his left palm like a street cop in a movie what are you doing he snarled looking for someone i said put that thing away we dont allow solicitation are you deaf im looking for someone not soliciting i walked past him toward the parking lot weve had a complaint he said to my back you need to leave im leaving dinner was a taco and a beer in a corporate bar not far away i felt safer eating in the suburbs the restaurant was of the cookiecutter variety a national chain getting rich with shiny new neighborhood watering holes the crowd was dominated by young government workers still trying to get home all talking policy and politics while drinking draft beer and yelling at a game loneliness was an adjustment my wife and friends had been left behind seven years in the sweatshop of drake and sweeney had not been conducive to nurturing friendships or a marriage either for that matter at the age of thirtytwo i was illprepared for the single life as i watched the game and the women i asked myself if i were expected to return to the bar and nightclub scene to find companionship surely there was some other place and method i got dejected and left i drove slowly into the city not anxious to arrive at my apartment my name was on a lease in a computer somewhere and i figured the police could find my loft without too much trouble if they were planning an arrest i was certain it would happen at night they would enjoy terrifying me with a midnight knock on the door a little roughing up as they frisked me and slapped on the cuffs a shove out the door down the elevator with death grips under my arms a push into the rear seat of a squad car for the ride to the city jail where i would be the only young white professional arrested that night they would like nothing better than to throw me into a holding cell with the usual assortment of thugs and leave me there to fend for myself i carried with me two things regardless of what i was doing one was a cell phone with which to call mordecai as soon as i was arrested the other was a folded stack of billstwenty hundreddollar billsto use to make bail and hopefully spring myself before i got near the holding cell i parked two blocks away from my building and watched every empty car for suspicious characters i made it to the loft untouched unapprehended my living room was now furnished with two lawn chairs and a plastic storage box used as a coffee tablefootstool the television was on a matching storage box i was amused at the sparse furnishings and determined to keep the place to myself no one would see how i was living my mother had called i listened to her recording she and dad were worried about me and wanted to come for a visit they had discussed things with brother warner and he might make the trip too l could almost hear their analysis of my new life somebody had to talk some sense into me the rally for lontae was the lead story at eleven there were closeups of the five black caskets lying on the steps of the district building and later as they were marched down the street mordecai was featured preaching to the masses the crowd appeared larger than i had realizedthe estimate was five thousand the mayor had no comment i turned off the television and punched claires number on the phone we had not talked in four days and i thought i would show some civility and break the ice technically we were still married it would be nice to have dinner in a week or so after the third ring a strange voice reluctantly said hello it was that of a male for a second i was too stunned to speak it was eleventhirty on a thursday night claire had a man over i had been gone for less than a week i almost hung up but then collected myself and said claire please whos calling he asked gruffly michael her husband shes in the shower he said with a trace of satisfaction tell her i called i said and hung up as quickly as possible i paced the three rooms until midnight then dressed again and went for a walk in the cold when a marriage crumbles you ponder all scenarios was it a simple matter of growing apart or was it much more complicated than that had i missed the signals was he a casual onenighter or had they been seeing each other for years was he some overheated doctor married with children or a young virile med student giving her what shed missed from me i kept telling myself it didnt matter we werent divorcing because of infidelities it was too late to worry if shed been sleeping around the marriage was over plain and simple for whatever reason she could go to hell for all i cared she was done dismissed forgotten if i was free to chase the ladies then the same rules applied to her yeah right at am i found myself at dupont circle ignoring catcalls from the queers and stepping around men bundied in layers and quilts and sleeping on benches it was dangerous but i didnt care a few hours later i bought a box of a dozen assorted at a krispy kreme with two tall coffees and a newspaper ruby was waiting faithfully at the door shivering from the cold her eyes were redder than usual her smile was not as quick our spot was a desk in the front the one with the fewest stacks of longforgotten files i cleared the top of the desk and served the coffee and doughnuts she didnt like chocolate but instead preferred the ones with the fruit filling do you read the newspaper i asked as i unfolded it no how well do you read not good so i read it to her we started with the front page primarily because it had a large photo of the five caskets seemingly adrift above the mass of people the story was headlined across the bottom half and i read every word of it to ruby who listened intently she had heard stories about the deaths of the burton family the details fascinated her could i die like that she asked no not unless your car has an engine and you run the heater i wish it had a heater you could die from exposure whats that freezing to death she wiped her mouth with a napkin and sipped her coffee the temperature had been eleven degrees the night ontario and his family died how had ruby survived where do you go when it gets real cold i asked dont go nowhere you stay in the car yes how do you keep from freezing i got plenty of blankets i just bury down in them you never go to a shelter never would you go to a shelter if it would help you see terrence she rolled her head to one side and gave me a strange look say it again she said you want to see terrence right right then you have to get clean right right to get clean youll have to live in a detox center for a while is that something youre willing to do maybe she said just maybe it was a small step but not an insignificant one i can help you see terrence again and you can be a part of his life but you have to get clean and stay clean how do i do it she asked her eyes unable to meet mine she cradled her coffee the steam rising to her face are you going to naomis today yes i talked to the director over there they have two meetings today alcoholics and drug addicts together theyre called aana i want you to attend both of them the director will call me she nodded like a scolded child i would push no further not at that moment she nibbled her doughnuts sipped her coffee and listened with rapt attention as i read one news story after another she cared little for foreign affairs and sports but the city news fascinated her she had voted at one time many years ago and the politics of the district were easily digested she understood the crime stories a long editorial blistered congress and the city for their failure to fund services for the homeless other lontaes would follow it warned other children would die in our streets in the shadows of the us capitol i paraphrased this for ruby who concurred with every phrase a soft freezing rain began falling so i drove ruby to her next stop for the day naomis womens center was a fourlevel rowhouse on tenth street nw in a block of similar structures it opened at seven closed at four and during each day provided food showers clothing activities and counseling for any homeless woman who could find the place ruby was a regular and received a warm greeting from her friends when we entered i spoke quietly with the director a young woman named megan we conspired to push ruby toward sobriety half the women there were mentally ill half were substance abusers a third were hivpositive ruby as far as megan knew carried no infectious diseases when i left the women were crowded into the main room singing songs i was hard at work at my desk when sofia knocked on my door and entered before i could answer mordecai says youre looking for someone she said she held a legal pad ready to take notes i thought for a second then remembered hector oh yes i am i can help tell me everything you know about the person she sat down and began writing as i ratfled off his name address last known place of employment physical description and the fact that he had a wife and four kids age maybe thirty approximate salary thirtyfive thousand with four kids its safe to assume at least one was enrolled in school with that salary and living in bethesda i doubt if theyd go the private route hes hispanic so hes probably catholic anything else i couldnt think of a thing she left and returned to her desk where she opened a thick threering notebook and flipped pages i kept my door open so i could watch and listen the first call went to someone with the postal service the conversation changed instantly to spanish and i was lost one call followed another she would say hello in english ask for her contact then switch to her native tongue she called the catholic diocese which led to another series of rapid calls i lost interest an hour later she walked to my door and announced they moved to chicago do you need an address how did you my words trailed off as i stared at her in disbelief dont ask a friend of a friend in their church they moved over the weekend in a hurry do you need their new address how long will it take it wont be easy i can point you in the right direction she had at least six clients sitting along the front window waiting to seek her advice not now i said maybe later thanks dont mention it dont mention it id planned to spend a few more hours after dark knocking on the doors of neighbors in the cold dodging security guards hoping no one shot me and she worked the phone for an hour and found the missing person drake and sweeney had more than a hundred lawyers in its chicago branch i had been there twice on anti trust cases the offices were in a skyscraper near the lakefront the buildings foyer was several stories tall with fountains and shops around the perimeter escalators zigzagging upward it was the perfect place to hide and watch for hector palma twentysix the homeless are close to the streets to the pavement the curbs and gutters the concrete the litter the sewer lids and fire hydrants and wastebaskets and bus stops and storefronts they move slowly over familiar terrain day after day stopping to talk to each other because time means little stopping to watch a stalled car in traffic a new drug dealer on a corner a strange face on their turf they sit on their sidewalks hidden under hats and caps and behind drugstore sunshades and like sentries they observe every movement they hear the sounds of the street they absorb the odors of diesel fumes from city buses and fried grease from cheap diners the same cab passes twice in an hour and they know it a gun is fired in the distance and they know where it came from a fine auto with virginia or maryland plates is parked at the curb theyll watch it until it leaves a cop with no uniform waits in a car with no markings and they see it the police are out there one of our clients said to sofia she walked to the front door looked southeast on q and there she saw what appeared to be an unmarked police car she waited half an hour and checked it again then she went to mordecai i was oblivious because i was fighting with the food stamp office on one front and the prosecutors office on another it was friday afternoon and the city bureaucracy substandard on a good day was shutting down fast they delivered the news together i think the cops might be waiting mordecai announced solemnly my first reaction was to duck under the desk but of course i did not i tried to appear calm where i asked as if it mattered at the corner theyve been watching the building for more than a half hour maybe theyre coming after you i said haha stone faces all around ive called sofia said and theres a warrant for your arrest grand larceny a felony prison a handsome white boy thrown into the pit i shifted weight from one side to another and i tried my best to show no fear thats no surprise i said happened all the time lets get it over with i have a call in for a guy at the prosecutors office mordecai said it would be nice if they allowed you to turn yourself in that would be nice i said as if it didnt really matter but ive been talking to the prosecutors office all afternoon no ones listening they have two hundred lawyers he said mordecai did not make friends on that side of the street cops and prosecutors were his natural enemies a quick game plan was devised sofia would call a bail bondsman who would meet us at the jail mordecai would try to find a friendly judge what was not said was the obviousit was friday afternoon i might not survive a weekend in the city jail they left to make their calls and i sat at my desk petrified unable to move or think or do anything but listen for the squeaking of the front door i didnt have to wait long at precisely pm lieutenant gasko entered with a couple of his men behind him during my first encounter with gasko when he was searching claires apartment when i was ranting and taking names and threatening all sorts of vile litigation against him and his buddies when every word uttered by him was met with a caustic retort from me when i was a hardcharging lawyer and he was a lowly cop it never occurred to me that he one day might have the pleasure of arresting me but there he was swaggering like an aging jock somehow sneering and smiling at the same time holding yet more papers folded and just waiting to be slapped against my chest i need to see mr brock he said to sofia and about that time i walked into the front room smiling hello gasko i said still looking for that file nope not today mordecai appeared from his office sofia was standing at her desk everybody looked at everybody you got a warrant mordecai asked yep for mr brock here gasko said i shrugged and said lets go i moved toward gasko one of the goons unsnapped a pair of handcuffs from his waist i was determined to at least look cool im his lawyer mordecai said let me see that he took the arrest warrant from gasko and examined it as i was getting cuffed hands behind my back wrists pinched by cold steel the cuffs were too tight or at least tighter than they had to be but i could bear it and i was determined to be nonchalant ill be happy to take my client to the police station mordecai said gee thanks gasko said but ill save you the trouble where will he go central ill follow you there mordecai said to me sofia was on the phone and that was even more comforting than knowing that mordecai would be somewhere behind me three of our clients saw it all three harmless street gentlemen in for a quick word with sofia they were sitting where the clients always waited and when i walked by them they watched in disbelief one of the goons squeezed my elbow and yanked me through the front door and i stepped onto the sidewalk anxious to duck into their car a dirty unmarked white one parked at the corner the homeless saw it all the car moving into position the cops rushing in the cops coming out with me handcuffed a lawyer got arrested they would soon whisper to each other and the news would race along the streets gasko sat in the rear with me i stayed low in the seat eyes watching nothing the shock settling in what a waste of time gasko said as he relaxed by placing a cowboy boot on a knee we got a hundred and forty unsolved murders in this city dope on every corner drug dealers selling in middle schools and we gotta waste time on you are you trying to interrogate me gasko i asked no good he hadnt bothered with the miranda warning and he didnt have to until he started asking questions goon one was flying south on fourteenth no lights or sirens and certainly no respect for traffic signals and pedestrians then let me go i said if its up to me i would but you really pissed some folks off the prosecutor tells me hes under pressure to get you pressure from who i asked but i knew the answer drake and sweeney wouldnt waste time with the cops they would rather talk legalspeak with the chief prosecutor the victims gasko said with heavy sarcasm i agreed with his assessment it was difficult to picture a bunch of wealthy lawyers as victims of a crime lots of famous people had been arrested i tried to recall them martin luther king went to jail several times there were boesky and milken and other noted thieves whose names escaped me and what about all those famous actors and athletes caught driving drunk and picking up prostitutes and possessing coke they had been thrown into the backseats of police cars and led away like common criminals there was a judge from memphis serving life an acquaintance from college in a halfway house a former client in the federal pen for tax evasion all had been arrested led downtown booked fingerprinted and had their pictures taken with the little number under their chins and all had survived i suspected that even mordecai green had felt the cold clasp of handcuffs there was an element of relief because it was finally happening i could stop running and hiding and looking to see if anyone was behind me the waiting was over and it was not a midnight raid one that would certainly keep me in jail until morning instead the hour was manageable with luck i could get processed and bailed out before the weekend rush hit but there was also an element of horror a fear i had never felt in my life many things could go wrong at the city jail paperwork might get lost delays of a dozen varieties could be created bail could be postponed until saturday or sunday or even monday i could be placed in a crowded cell with unfriendly to nasty people word would leak that i had been arrested my friends would shake their heads and wonder what else i could do to screw up my life my parents would be devastated i wasnt sure about claire especially now that the gigolo was keeping her company i closed my eyes and tried to get comfortable which i found impossible to do while sitting on my hands the processing was a blur surreal movements from one point to the next with gasko leading me like a lost puppy eyes on the floor i kept telling myself dont look at these people inventory first everything from the pockets sign a form down the dirty hall to photos shoes off up against the measuring tape dont have to smile if you dont want to but please look at the camera then a profile then to fingerprinting which happened to be busy so gasko handcuffed me like a mental patient to a chair in the hall while he went to find coffee arrestees shuffled past all in various stages of processing cops everywhere a white face not a cop but a defendant much like myselfyoung male handsome navy suit obviously drunk with a bruise on his left cheek how does one get plastered before pm on a friday he was loud and threatening his words garbled and harsh and ignored by everyone i could see then he was gone time passed and i began to panic it was dark outside the weekend had started crime would begin and the jail would get busier gasko came back took me into fingerprinting and watched as poindexter efficiently applied the ink and stuck my fingers to the sheets no phone calls were needed my lawyer was somewhere close by though gasko hadnt seen him the doors got heavier as we descended into the jail we were going in the wrong direction the street was back behind us cant i make bail i finally asked i saw bars ahead bars over windows and busy guards with guns i think your lawyers working on it gasko said he gave me to sergeant coffey who pushed me against a wall kicked my legs apart and frisked me as if searching for a dime finding none he pointed and grunted at a metal detector which i walked through without offense a buzzer a door slid open a hallway appeared one with rows of bars on both sides a door clanged behind me and my prayer for an easy release vanished hands and arms protruded through the bars into the narrow hall the men watched us as we moved past my gaze returned to my feet coffey looked into each cell i thought he was counting bodies we stopped at the third one on the right my cellmates were black all much younger than i was i counted four at first then saw a fifth lying on the top bunk there were two beds for six people the cell was a small square with three walls of nothing but bars so i could see the prisoners next door and across the hall the rear wall was cinder block with a small toilet in one corner coffey slammed the door behind me the guy on the top bunk sat up and swung his legs over the side so that they dangled near the face of a guy sitting on the bottom bunk all five glared at me as i stood by the door trying to appear calm and unafraid trying desperately to find a place to sit on the floor so that i wouldnt be in danger of touching any of my cellmates thank god they had no weapons thank god someone installed the metal detector they had no guns and knives i had no assets other than clothing my watch wallet cell phone cashand everything else i had with mehad been taken and inventoried the front of the cell would be safer than the rear i ignored their eyes and took my spot on the floor my back resting on the door down the hall someone was yelling for a guard a fight broke out two cells away and through the bars and bunks i could see the drunk guy with the white face and navy suit pinned in a corner by two large black men who were pounding his head other voices encouraged them on and the entire wing grew rowdy it was not a good moment to be white a shrill whistle a door opened and coffey was back nightstick in hand the fight ended abruptly with the drunk on his stomach and still coffey went to the cell and inquired as to what happened no one knew no one had seen a thing keep it quiet he demanded then left minutes passed the drunk began to groan someone was vomiting in the distance one of my cellmates got to his feet and walked to where i was sitting his bare feet barely touched my leg i glanced up then away he glared down and i knew this was the end nice jacket he said thanks i mumbled trying not to sound sarcastic or in any way provocative the jacket was a navy blazer an old one that i wore every day with jeans and khakismy radical attire it certainly wasnt worth being slaughtered over nice jacket he said again and he added a slight nudge with his foot the guy on the top bunk jumped down and stepped closer for a better look thanks i said again he was eighteen or nineteen lean and tall not an ounce of fat probably a gang member whod spent his life on the streets he was cocky and anxious to impress the others with his bravado mine would be the easiest ass hed ever kicked i dont have a jacket that nice he said a firmer nudge with his foot one intended to provoke shouldnt be a lowlife street punk i thought he couldnt steal it because there was no place to run would you like to borrow it i asked without looking up no i pulled my feet in so that my knees were close to my chin it was a defensive position when he kicked or swung i was not going to fight back any resistance would immediately bring in the other four and they would have a delightful time thrashing the white boy dude says you got a nice jacket said the one from the top bunk and i said thanks dude says he aint got no jacket that nice so what am i supposed to do i asked a gift would be appropriate a third one stepped forward and closed the semicircle around me the first one kicked my foot and all inched closer they were ready to pounce each waiting for the other so i quickly removed my blazer and thrust it forward is this a gift the first one asked taking it its whatever you want it to be i said i was looking down sull avoiding eye contact thus i didnt see his foot it was a vicious kick that slapped my left temple and jerked my head backward where it cracked against the bars shit i yelled as i felt the back of my head you can have the damned thing i said bracing for the onslaught is it a gift yes thanks man dont mention it i said rubbing my face my entire head was numb they backed away leaving me curled in a tight ball minutes passed though i had no concept of time the drunk white guy two doors down was making an effort to revive himself and another voice was calling for a guard the punk with my jacket did not put it on the cell swallowed it my face throbbed but there was no blood if i received no further injuries as an inmate i would consider myself lucky a comrade down the hall yelled something about trying to sleep and i began to ponder what the night might bring six inmates two very narrow beds were we expected to sleep on the floor with no blanket and pillow the floor was getting cold and as i sat on it i glanced at my cellmates and speculated as to what crimes they had committed i of course had borrowed a file with every intention of returning it yet there i was low man on the pole among drug dealers car thieves rapists probably even murderers i wasnt hungry but i thought about food i had no toothbrush i didnt need the toilet but what would happen when i did where was the drinking water the basics became crucial nice shoes a voice said startling me i looked up to see another one of them standing above me he wore dirty white socks no shoes and his feet were several inches longer than mine thanks i said the shoes in question were old nike crosstrainers they were not basketball shoes and should not have appealed to my cellmate for once i wished id been wearing the tasseled loafers from my previous career what size he asked tens the punk who took my jacket walked closer the message was given and received same size i wear the first one said would you like to have these i said i immediately began unlacing them here i would like to present you with a gift of my shoes i quickly kicked them off and he took them what about my jeans and underwear i wanted to ask my bail was ten thousand dollars mordecai was waiting with the bondsman i paid him a thousand in cash and signed the paperwork coffey brought my shoes and blazer and my incarceration was over sofia waited outside with her car and they whisked me away mordecai finally broke through around pm coffey fetched me from the cell and as we made our way toward the front he asked where are your shoes in the cell i said they were taken ill get them thanks i had a navy blazer too he looked at the left side of my face where the corner of my eye was beginning to swell are you okay wonderful im free twentyseven strictly in physical terms i was paying a price for my journey from the tower to the street the bruises from the car wreck were almost gone but the soreness in the muscles and joints would take weeks i was losing weight for two reasonsi couldnt afford the restaurants id once taken for granted and id lost interest in food my back ached from sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag a practice i was determined to pursue in an effort to see if it would ever become tolerable i had my doubts and then a street punk almost cracked my skull with his bare foot i iced it until late and every time i awoke during the night it seemed to be expanding but i felt lucky to be alive lucky to be in one piece after descending into hell for a few hours before being rescued the fear of the unknown had been removed at least for the present there were no cops lurking in the shadows grand larceny was nothing to laugh at especially since i was guilty the maximum was ten years in prison i would worry about it later i left my apartment just before sunrise saturday in a rush to find the nearest newspaper my new neighborhood coffee shop was a tiny allnight bakery run by a rowdy family of pakistanis on kalorama in a section of adamsmorgan that could go from safe to treacherous in one small block i sidled up to the counter and ordered a large latte then i opened the newspaper and found the one little story id lost sleep over my friends at drake and sweeney had planned it well on page two of metro there was my face in a photo taken a year earlier for a recruiting brochure the firm had developed only the firm had the negative the story was four paragraphs brief to the point and filled primarily with information fed to the reporter by the firm i had worked there for seven years in antitrust law school at yale no prior criminal record the firm was the fifthlargest in the countryeight hundred lawyers eight cities and so on no one got quoted because no quotes were necessary the sole purpose of the story was to humiliate me and to that end it worked well local attorney arrested for grand larceny read the headline next to my face items taken was the description of the stolen loot items taken during my recent departure from the firm it sounded like a silly little spata bunch of lawyers quibbling over nothing but paperwork who would care other than myself and anyone who might know me the embarrassment would quickly go away there were too many real stories in the world the photo and the background had found a friendly reporter one willing to process his four paragraphs and wait until my arrest could be confirmed with no effort whatsoever i could see arthur and rafter and their team spending hours planning my arrest and its aftermath hours that no doubt would be billed to riveroaks only because it happened to be the client nearest to the mess what a public relations coup four paragraphs in the saturday edition the pakistanis didnt bake fruitfilled doughnuts i bought oatmeal cookies instead and drove to the office ruby was asleep in the doorway and as i approached i wondered how long she had been there she was covered with two or three old quilts and her head rested on a large canvas shopping bag packed with her belongings she sprang to her feet after i coughed and made noise why are you sleeping here i asked she looked at the paper bag of food and said i gotta sleep somewhere i thought you slept in a car i do most of the time nothing productive would come from a conversation with a homeless person about why she slept here or there ruby was hungry i unlocked the door turned on lights and went to make coffee she according to our ritual went straight to what had become her desk and waited we had coffee and cookies with the morning news we alternated storiesi read one i wanted then one that was of interest to her i ignored the one about me ruby had walked out of the aana meeting the afternoon before at naomis the morning session had gone without incident but she had bolted from the second one megan the director had called me about an hour before gasko made his appearance how do you feel this morning i asked when we finished the paper fine and you fine im clean are you her chin dropped an inch her eyes cut to one side and she paused just long enough for the truth yes she said im clean no youre not dont lie to me ruby im your friend and your lawyer and im going to help you see terrence but i cant help you if you lie to me now look me in the eyes and tell me if youre clean she somehow managed to shrink even more and with her eyes on the floor she said im not clean thank you why did you walk out of the aana meeting yesterday afternoon i didnt the director said you did i thought they was through i was not going to be sucked into an argument i couldnt win are you going to naomis today yes good ill take you but you have to promise me youll go to both meetings i promise you have to be the first one in the meetings and the last one to leave okay okay and the director will be watching she nodded and took another cookie her fourth we talked about terrence and rehab and getting clean and again i began to feel the hopelessness of addiction she was overwhelmed by the challenge of staying clean for just twentyfour hours the drug was crack as i suspected instantly addictive and dirt cheap as we drove to naomis ruby suddenly said you got arrested didnt you i almost ran a red light she was sleeping on the office doorstep at sunrise she was barely literate how could she have seen the newspaper yes i did thought so how did you know you hear stuff on the street ah yes forget papers the homeless carry their own news that young lawyer down at mordecais got himself arrested cops hauled him away just like he was one of us its a misunderstanding i said as if she cared theyd started singing without her we could hear them as we walked up the steps to naomis megan unlocked the front door and invited me to stay for coffee in the main room on the first level in what was once a fine parlor the ladies of naomis sang and shared and listened to each others problems we watched them for a few minutes as the only male i felt like an intruder megan poured coffee in the kitchen and gave me a quick tour of the place we whispered because the ladies were praying not far away there were rest rooms and showers on the first floor near the kitchen a small garden out back where those suffering from depression often went to be alone the second floor was offices intake centers and a rectangular room crammed with chairs where the alcoholics anonymousnarcotics anonymous chapters met together as we climbed the narrow stairs a joyous chorus erupted from below megans office was on the third floor she invited me in and as soon as i sat down she tossed a copy of the post into my lap rough night huh she said with a smile i looked at my photo again it wasnt too bad whats this she asked pointing to her temple my cell partner wanted my shoes he took them she looked at my wellused nikes those yes handsome arent they how long were you in jail couple of hours then i got my life together made it through rehab now im a new man she smiled again a perfect smile and our eyes lingered for a second and i thought oh boy no wedding ring on her finger she was tall and a little too thin her hair was dark red and cut short and smart above the ears like a preppie her eyes were light brown very big and round and quite pleasant to gaze into for a second or two it struck me that she was very attractive and it seemed odd that i hadnt noticed it sooner was i being set up had i wandered up the stairs for a reason other than the tour how had i missed the smile and the eyes yesterday we swapped bios her father was an episcopal priest in maryland and a redskins fan who loved dc as a teenager she had decided to work with the poor there was no higher calling i had to confess i had never thought about the poor until two weeks earlier she was captivated by the story of mister and its purifying effects on me she invited me to return for lunch to check on ruby if the sun was out we could eat in the garden poverty lawyers are no different from other people they can find romance in odd places like a shelter for homeless women after a week of driving through dcs roughest sections and spending hours in shelters and in general mixing and mingling with the homeless i no longer felt the need to hide behind mordecai every time i ventured out he was a valuable shield but to survive on the streets i had to jump in the lake and learn to swim i had a list of almost thirty shelters and kitchens and centers where the homeless came and went and i had a list of the names of the seventeen people evicted including devon hardy and lontae burton my next stop saturday morning after naomis was the mount gilead christian church near gallaudet university according to my map it was the kitchen nearest the intersection of new york and florida where the warehouse had once stood the director was a young woman named gloria who when i arrived at nine was alone in the kitchen chopping celery and fretting over the fact that no volunteers had arrived after i introduced myself and did a thorough job of convincing her that my credentials were in order she pointed to a cutting board and asked me to dice the onions how could a bona fide poverty lawyer say no i had done it before i explained in dollys kitchen back during the snowstorm she was polite but behind schedule as i worked the onions and wiped my eyes i described the case i was working on and ratfled off the names of the people evicted along with devon hardy and lontae burton were not case managers she said we just feed them i dont know many names a volunteer arrived with a sack of potatoes i made preparations to leave gloria thanked me and took a copy of the names she promised to listen harder my movements were planned i had many stops to make and little time i talked to a doctor at the capitol clinic a privately funded walkin facility for the homeless the clinic kept a record of every patient it was saturday and on monday he would have the secretary check the computer files against my list if there was a match the secretary would call i drank tea with a catholic priest at the redeemer mission off rhode island he studied the names with great intensity but no bells went off there are so many he said the only scare of the morning occurred at the freedom coalition a large gathering hall built by some longforgotten association and later converted to a community center at eleven a lunch line was forming by the front entrance since i wasnt there to eat i simply ignored the line and walked directly to the door some of the gentlemen waiting for food thought i was breaking their line and they threw obscenities at me they were hungry and suddenly angry and the fact that i was white didnt help matters how could they mistake me for a homeless person the door was being manned by a volunteer who also thought i was being an ass he stiffarmed me rudely another act of violence against my person im not here to eat i said angrily im a lawyer for the homeless that setfled them down suddenly i was a blueeyed brother i was allowed to enter the building without further assault the director was reverend kip a fiery little guy with a red beret and a black collar we did not connect when he realized that a i was a lawyer b my clients were the burtons c i was working on their lawsuit and d there might be a recovery of damages down the road he began thinking about money i wasted thirty minutes with him and left with the vow to send in mordecai i called megan and begged off lunch my excuse was that i was on the other side of the city with a long list of people yet to see the truth was that i couldnt tell if she was flirting she was pretty and smart and thoroughly likable and she was the last thing i needed i hadnt flirted in almost ten years i didnt know the rules but megan had great news ruby had not only survived the morning session of aana she had vowed to stay clean for twentyfour hours it was an emotional scene and megan had watched from the rear of the room she needs to stay off the streets tonight megan said she hasnt had a clean day in twelve years i of course was of little help megan had several ideas the afternoon was as fruitless as the morning though i did learn the location of every shelter in the district and i met people made contacts swapped cards with folks id probably see again kelvin lam remained the sole evictee wed been able to locate devon hardy and lontae burton were dead i was left with a total of fourteen people who had fallen through the cracks in the sidewalks the hardcore homeless venture into shelters from time to time for a meal or a pair of shoes or a blanket but they leave no trail they do not want help they have no desire for human contact it was hard to believe that the remaining fourteen were hard core a month earlier they had been living under a roof and paying rent patience mordecai kept telling me street lawyers must have patience ruby met me at the door of naomis with a gleaming smile and a fierce hug she had completed both sessions megan had already laid the groundwork for the next twelve hoursruby would not be allowed to stay on the streets ruby had acquiesced ruby and i left the city and drove west into virginia in a suburban shopping center we bought a toothbrush and toothpaste soap shampoo and enough candy to get through halloween we drove farther away from the city and in the small town of gainesville i found a shiny new motel advertising single rooms for fortytwo dollars a night i paid with a credit card surely it would somehow be deductible i left her there with strict instructions to stay in the room with the door locked until i came for her sunday morning twentyeight saturday night the first day of march young single certainly not as rich as i was not too long ago but not completely broke yet a closet full of nice clothes which were not being used a city of one million people with scores of attractive young women drawn to the center of political power and always ready it was rumored for a good time i had beer and pizza and watched college basketball alone in my loft and not unhappy any public appearance that night could have ended quickly with the cruel greeting hey arent you the guy who got arrested saw it in the paper this morning i checked on ruby the phone rang eight times before she answered and i was about to panic she was enjoying herself immensely having taken a long shower eaten a pound of candy and watched tv nonstop she had not left the room she was twenty miles away in a small town just off the interstate in the virginia countryside where neither she nor i knew a soul there was no way she could find drugs i patted myself on the back again during halftime of the dukecarolina game the cell phone on the plastic storage box next to the pizza squawked and starfled me a very pleasant female voice said hello jailbird it was claire without the edge hello i said muting the television you okay just doing great how about you fine i saw your smiling face in the paper this morning and i was worried about you claire read the sunday paper only so if she saw my little story someone gave it to her probably the same hotblooded doc whod answered the phone the last time id called was she alone on saturday night like me it was an experience i said then told her the entire story beginning with gasko and ending with my release she wanted to talk and as the narrative plodded along i decided that she was indeed by herself probably bored and maybe lonely and perhaps there was a chance that she was really worried about me how serious are the charges she asked grand larceny carries up to ten years i said gravely i liked the prospect of her being concerned but im not worried about that its just a file isnt it yes and it wasnt a theft sure it was but i was not yet prepared to admit that could you lose your license to practice yes if im convicted of a felony it would be automatic thats awful mike what would you do then truthfully i havent thought about it its not going to happen i was being completely honest i had not seriously thought about losing my law license perhaps it was an issue requiring consideration but i had not found the time for it we politely inquired about each others family and i remembered to ask about her brother james and his hodgkins disease his treatment was under way the family was optimistic i thanked her for calling and we promised to keep in touch when i laid the cell phone next to the pizza i stared at the muted game and grudgingly admitted to myself that i missed her ruby was showered and shined and wearing the fresh clothing megan had given her yesterday her motel room was on the ground floor with the door facing the parking lot she was waiting for me she stepped into the sunlight and hugged me tightly im clean she said with a huge smile for twentyfour hours im clean we hugged again a couple in their sixties stepped from the room two doors down and stared at us god knows what they were thinking we returned to the city and went to naomis where megan and her staff were waiting for the news a small celebration erupted when ruby made her announcement megan had told me that the biggest cheers were always for the first twentyfour hours it was sunday and a local pastor arrived to conduct a bible study the women gathered in the main room for hymns and prayer megan and i drank coffee in the garden and worked out the next twentyfour hours in addition to prayer and worship ruby would get two heavy sessions of aana but our optimism was guarded megan lived in the midst of addiction and she was convinced ruby would slide as soon as she returned to the streets she saw it every day i could afford the motel strategy for a few days and i was willing to pay for it but i would leave for chicago at four that afternoon to begin my search for hector and i wasnt sure how long i would be away ruby liked the motel in fact she appeared to be quite fond of it we decided to take things one day at a time megan would drive ruby to a suburban motel one i would pay for and deposit her there for sunday night she would retrieve her monday morning and we would then worry about what to do next megan would also begin the task of trying to convince ruby she had to leave the streets her first stop would be a detox center then a transitional womens shelter for six months of structured living job training and rehab twentyfour hours is a big step she said but there is still a mountain to climb i left as soon as i could she invited me to return for lunch we could eat in her office just the two of us and discuss important matters her eyes were dancing and daring me to say yes so i did drake and sweeney lawyer always flew firstclass they felt as if they deserved it they stayed in fourstar hotels ate in swanky restaurants but drew the line at limousines which were deemed too extravagant so they rented lincolns all travel expenses were billed to the clients and since the clients were getting the best legal talent in the world the clients shouldnt complain about the perks my seat on the flight to chicago was in coach booked at the last minute and therefore in the dreaded middle the window seat was occupied by a hefty gentleman whose knees were the size of basketballs and on the aisle was a smelly youngster of eighteen or so with jetblack hair cut into a perfect mohawk and adorned in an amazing collection of black leather and pointed chrome i squeezed myself together closed my eyes for two hours and tried not to think about the pompous asses sitting up there in firstclass where i once rode the trip was in direct violation of my bail agreement i was not to leave the district without permission of the judge but mordecai and i agreed that it was a minor violation one that would be of no consequence as long as i returned to dc from ohare i took a cab to an inexpensive hotel downtown sofia had been unable to find a new residential address for the palmas if i couldnt find hector at the drake and sweeney office then we were out of luck the chicago branch of drake and sweeney had one hundred and six lawyers third highest after washington and new york the real estate section was disproportionately large with eighteen lawyers more than the washington office i assumed that was the reason hector had been sent to chicagothere was a place for him there was plenty of work to do i vaguely recalled some story of drake and sweeney absorbing a prosperous chicago real estate firm early in my career i arrived at the associated life building shortly after seven monday morning the day was gray and gloomy with a vicious wind whipping across lake michigan it was my third visit to chicago and the other two times it had been just as raw i bought coffee to drink and a newspaper to hide behind and i found a vantage point at a table in a corner of the ground floors vast atrium the escalators crisscrossed to the second and third levels where a dozen elevators stood waiting by seventhirty the ground floor was crawling with busy people at eight after three cups of coffee i was wired and expecting the man at any moment the escalators were packed with hundreds of executives lawyers secretaries all bundled in heavy coats and looking remarkably similar at eighttwenty hector palma entered the atrium from the south side of the building stepping hurriedly inside with a swarm of other commuters he raked his fingers through his windtossed hair and went straight for the escalators as casually as possible i walked to another escalator and eased my way up the steps i caught a glimpse of him as he turned a corner to wait for an elevator it was definitely hector and i decided not to press my luck my assumptions were correct he had been transferred out of washington in the middle of the night and sent to the chicago office where he could be monitored and bribed with more money and if necessary threatened i knew where he was and i knew he wouldnt be leaving for the next eight to ten hours from the second level of the atrium with a splendid view of the lake i phoned megan ruby had survived the night we were now at fortyeight hours and counting i called mordecai to report my finding according to last years drake and sweeney handbook there were three partners in the real estate section of the chicago office the building directory in the atrium listed all three on floor number fiftyone i picked one of them at random dick heile i rode the nine oclock surge upward to the fiftyfirst floor and stepped off the elevator into a familiar settingmarble brass walnut recessed lighting fine rugs as i walked casually toward the receptionist i glanced around in search of rest rooms i did not see any she was answering the phone with a headset i frowned and tried to look as pained as possible yes sir she said with a bright smile between calls i gritted my teeth sucked in air said yes i have a nine oclock appointment with dick heile but im afraid im about to be sick it mustre been something i ate can i use your rest room i clutched my stomach folded my knees and i must have convinced her that i was about to vomit on her desk the smile vanished as she jumped to her feet and began pointing down there around the corner to your right i was already moving bent at the waist as if i might blow up at any second thanks i managed to say can i get you something she asked i shook my head too stricken to say anything else around the corner i ducked into the mens rest room where i locked myself in a stall and waited at the rate her phone was ringing she would be too busy to worry about me i was dressed like a bigfirm lawyer so i did not appear to be suspicious after ten minutes i walked out of the mens room and started down the hall away from the receptionist at the first empty desk i grabbed some papers that were stapled together and scribbled as i walked as if i had important business my eyes darted in every direction the names on doors names on desks secretaries too busy to look up lawyers with gray hair in shirtsleeves young lawyers on the phone with their doors cracked typists pecking away with dictation it was so familiar hector had his own office a small room with no name anywhere in sight i saw him through his halfopen door and i immediately burst in and slammed it behind me he jerked back in his chair with both palms up as if he were facing a gun what the hell he said hello hector no gun no assault just a bad memory his palms fell to his desk and he actually smiled what the hell he said again so hows chicago i asked resting my butt on the edge of his desk what are you doing here he asked in disbelief i could ask you the same question im working he said scratching his head five hundred feet above the street tucked away in his nondescript little room with no windows insulated by layers of more important people hector had been found by the only person he was running from howd you find me he asked it was very easy ilector im a street lawyer now savvy and smart you run again ill find you again im not running anymore he said looking away it was not entirely for my benefit were filing suit tomorrow i said the defendants will be riveroaks tag and drake and sweeney theres no place for you to hide who are the plaintiffs lontae burton and family later well add the other evictees when we find all of them he closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose you remember lontae dont you hector she was the young mother who fought with the cops when you were evicting everyone you saw it all and you felt guilty because you knew the truth you knew she was paying rent to gantry you put it all in your memo the one dated january twentyseventh and you made sure the memo was properly indexed into the file you did this because you knew braden chance would remove it at some point and he did and thats why im here hector i want a copy of the memo i have the rest of the file and its about to be exposed now i want the memo what makes you think i have a copy because youre too smart not to copy it you knew chance would remove the original to cover his ass but now he is about to be exposed dont go down with him then where do i go nowhere i said you have nowhere to go he knew it since he knew the truth about the eviction he would be forced to testify at some point and in some manner his testimony would sink drake and sweeney and he would be terminated it was a course of events mordecai and i had talked about we had a few crumbs to offer if you give me the memo i said i will not tell where it came from and i will not call you as a witness unless i am absolutely forced to he was shaking his head i could lie you know he said sure you could but you wont because youll get nailed its easy to prove your memo was logged into the file then removed you cant deny writing it then we have the testimony of the people you evicted theyll make great witnesses before an allblack jury in dc and weve talked to the guard who was with you on january twentyseventh every punch landed flush on the jaw and hector was on the ropes actually we had been unable to find the guard the file did not give his name forget lying i said it will only make things worse hector was too honest to lie he was after all the person who had slipped me the list of the evictees and the keys with which to steal the file he had a soul and a conscience and he couldnt be happy hiding in chicago running from his past has chance told them the truth i asked i dont know he said i doubt it that would take guts and chance is a coward theyll fire me you know maybe but youll have a beautiful lawsuit against them ill handle it for you well sue them again and i wont charge you a dime there was a knock on his door it scared both of us our conversation had taken us back in time yes he said and a secretary entered mr peck is waiting she said sizing me up ill be there in one minute hector said and she slowly backtracked through the door leaving it open i have to go he said im not leaving without a copy of the memo meet me at noon by the water fountain in front of the building ill be there i winked at the receptionist as i passed through the foyer thanks i said im much better youre welcome she said from the fountain we went west on grand avenue to a crowded jewish deli as we waited in line to order a sandwich hector handed me an envelope i have four children he said please protect me i took the envelope and was about to say something when he stepped backward and got lost in the crowd i saw him squeeze through the door and go past the deli the flaps of his overcoat around his ears almost running to get away from me i forgot about lunch i walked four blocks to the hotel checked out and threw my things into a cab sitting low in the backseat doors locked cabbie halfasleep no one in the world knowing where i was at that moment i opened the envelope the memo was in the typical drake and sweeney format prepared on hectors pc with the client code file number and date in tiny print along the bottom left it was dated january sent to braden chance from hector palma regarding the riveroakstag eviction florida warehouse property on that day hector had gone to the warehouse with an armed guard jeff mackle of rock creek security arriving at am and leaving at the warehouse had three levels and after first noticing squatters on the ground floor hector went to the second level where there was no sign of habitation on the third level he saw litter old clothing and the remnants of a campfire someone had used many months earlier on the west end of the ground level he found eleven temporary apartments all hastily assembled from plywood and sheetrock unpainted but obviously built by the same person at about the same time with some effort at order each apartment was roughly the same size judging from the outside hector couldnt obtain entry to any of them every door was the same a light hollow synthetic material probably plastic with a doorknob and a dead bolt the bathroom was well used and filthy there had been no recent improvements to it hector encountered a man who identified himself only as herman and herman had no interest in talking hector asked how much rent was being charged for the apartments and herman said none said that he was squatting the sight of an armed guard in a uniform had a chilling effect on the conversation on the east end of the building ten units of similar design and construction were found a crying child drew hector to one of the doors and he asked the guard to stand back in the shadows a young mother answered his knock she held a baby three other children swarmed around her legs hector informed her that he was with a law firm that the building had been sold and that she would be asked to leave in a few days she at first said she was squatting then quickly went on the attack it was her apartment she rented it from a man named johnny who came around on the fifteenth of each month to collect a hundred dollars nothing in writing she had no idea who owned the building johnny was her only contact she had been there for three months couldnt leave because there was no place to go she worked twenty hours a week at a grocery store hector told her to pack her things and get ready to move the building would be leveled in ten days she became frantic hector tried to provoke her further he asked if she had any proof that she was paying rent she found her purse under the bed and handed him a scrap of paper a tape from a grocery store cash register on the back someone had scrawled recd frm lontae burton jan rent the memo was two pages long but there was a third page attached to it a copy of the scarcely readable receipt hector had taken it from her copied it and attached the original to the memo the writing was hurried the spelling flawed the copying blurred but it was stunning i must have made some ecstatic noise because the cabdriver jerked his head and examined me in the mirror the memo was a straightforward description of what hector saw said and heard there were no conclusions no caveats to his higherups give them enough rope he must have said to himself and see if theyll hang themselves he was a lowly paralegal in no position to give advice or offer opinions or stand in the way of a deal at ohare i faxed it to mordecai if my plane crashed or if i got mugged and someone stole it i wanted a copy tucked away deep in the files of the th street legal clinic twentynine since lontae burtons father was a person unknown to us and probably unknown to the world and since her mother and all siblings were behind bars we made the tactical decision to bypass the family and use a trustee as a client while i was in chicago monday morning mordecai appeared before a judge in the dc family court and asked for a temporary trustee to serve as guardian of the estates of lontae burton and each of her children it was a routine matter done in private the judge was an acquaintance of mordecais the petition was approved in minutes and we had ourselves a new client her name was wilma phelan a social worker mordecai knew her role in the litigation would be minor and she would be entitled to a very small fee in the event we recovered anything the cohen trust may have been illmanaged from a financial standpoint but it had rules and bylaws covering every conceivable aspect of a nonprofit legal clinic leonard cohen had been a lawyer obviously one with an appetite for detail though discouraged and frowned upon it was permissible for the clinic to handle an injury or wrongful death case on a contingencyfee basis but the fee was capped at twenty percent of the recovery as opposed to the standard one third some trial lawyers customarily took forty percent of the twenty percent contingentyfee the clinic could keep half the other ten percent went to the trust in fourteen years mordecai had handled two cases on a contingency basis the first hed lost with a bad jury the second involved a homeless woman hit by a city bus hed settled it for one hundred thousand dollars netting the clinic a grand total of ten thousand dollars from which he purchased new phones and word processors the judge reluctantly approved our contract at twenty percent and we were ready to sue tipoff was at seven thirtyfivegeorgetown versus syracuse mordecai somehow squeezed two tickets my flight arrived at national on time at sixtwenty and thirty minutes later i met mordecai at the east entrance of the us air arena in landover we were joined by almost twenty thousand other fans he handed me a ticket then pulled from his coat pocket a thick unopened envelope sent by registered mail to my attention at the clinic it was from the dc bar it came today he said knowing exactly what it contained ill meet you at our seats he disappeared into a crowd of students i tipped it open and found a spot outside with enough light to read my friends at drake and sweeney were unloading everything they had it was a formal complaint filed with the court of appeals accusing me of unethical behavior the allegations ran for three pages but could have been adequately captured in one good paragraph id stolen a file id breached confidentiality i was a bad boy who should be either disbarred permanently or suspended for many years andor publicly reprimanded and since the file was still missing the matter was urgent and therefore the inquiry and procedure should be expedited there were notices forms other papers i hardly glanced at it was a shock and i leaned on a wall to steady myself and contemplate matters sure i had thought about a bar proceeding it would have been unrealistic to think the firm would not pursue all avenues to retrieve the file but i thought the arrest might appease them for a while evidently not they wanted blood it was a typical bigfirm hardball takenoprisoners strategy and i understood it perfectly what they didnt know was that at nine the following morning i would have the pleasure of suing them for ten million dollars for the wrongful deaths of the burtons according to my assessment there was nothing else they could do to me no more warrants no more registered letters all issues were on the table all lines drawn in a small way it was a relief to be holding the papers and it was also frightening since id started law school ten years earlier i had never seriously considered work in another field what would i do without a law license but then sofia didnt have one and she was my equal mordecai met me inside at the portal leading to our seats i gave him a brief summary of the bar petition he offered me his condolences while the game promised to be tense and exciting basketball was not our top priority jeff mackle was a parttime gun at rock creek security and he also worked events at the arena sofia had tracked him down during the day we figured he would be one of a hundred uniformed guards loitering around the building watching the game for free and gazing at coeds we had no idea if he was old young white black fat or lean but the security guards wore small nameplates above their left breast pockets we walked the aisles and portals until almost halftime before mordecai found him hitting on a cute ticket clerk at gate d a spot i had inspected twice mackle was large white plainfaced and about my age his neck and biceps were enormous his chest thick and bulging the legal team huddled briefly and decided it would be best if i approached him with one of my business cards between my fingers i walked casually up to him and introduced myself mr mackle im michael brock attorney he gave me the look one normally gets with such a greeting and took the card without comment i had interrupted his flirting with the ticket clerk could i ask you a few questions i said in my best homicide detective impersonation you can ask i may not answer he winked at the ticket clerk have you ever done any security work for drake and sweeney a big law firm in the district maybe ever help them with any evictions i hit a nerve his face hardened instantly and the conversation was practically over dont think so he said glancing away are you sure no the answer is no you didnt help the firm evict a warehouse full of squatters on february fourth he shook his head jaw clenched eyes narrow someone from drake and sweeney had already visited mr mackle or more than likely the firm had threatened his employer at any rate mackle was stonefaced the ticket clerk was preoccupied with her nails i was shut out sooner or later youll have to answer my questions i said the muscles in his jaw flinched but he had no response i was not inclined to push harder he was rough around the edges the type who could erupt with a flurry of fists and lay waste to a humble street lawyer i had been wounded enough in the past two weeks i watched ten minutes of the second half then left with spasms in my back aftereffects of the car wreck the motel was another new one on the northern fringe of bethesda also forty bucks a night and after three nights i couldnt afford any more lockdown therapy for ruby megan was of the opinion it was time for her to return home if she was going to stay sober the real test would come on the streets at seventhirty tuesday morning i knocked on her door on the second floor room per megans instructions there was no answer i knocked again and again and tried the knob it was locked i ran to the lobby and asked the receptionist to call the room again no answer no one had checked out nothing unusual had been reported an assistant manager was summoned and i convinced her that there was an emergency she called a security guard and the three of us went to the room along the way i explained what we were doing with ruby and why the room wasnt in her name the assistant manager didnt like the idea of using her nice motel to detox crackheads the room was empty the bed was meticulous no sign of use during the night not a single item was out of place and nothing of hers had been left behind i thanked them and left the motel was at least ten miles from our office i called megan to alert her then fought my way into the city with a million other commuters at eightfifteen sitting in stalled traffic i called the office and asked sofia if ruby had been seen she had not the lawsuit was brief and to the point wilma phelan trustee for the estates of lontae burton and her children was suing riveroaks drake and sweeney and tag inc for conspiring to commit a wrongful eviction the logic was simple the causal connection obvious our clients would not have been living in their car had they not been thrown out of their apartment and they wouldnt have died had they not been living in their car it was a lovely theory of liability one made even more attractive because of its simplicity any jury in the country could follow the rationale the negligence andor intentional acts of the defendants caused the deaths which were foreseeable bad things happened to those living on the streets espe cially single mothers with little children toss them out of their homes wrongfully and you pay the price if they get hurt we had briefly considered a separate lawsuit for misters death he too had been illegally evicted but his death could not be considered foreseeable taking hostages and getting shot in the process were not a reasonable chain of events for one civilly wronged also he had little jury appeal we put mister to rest permanently drake and sweeney would immediately ask the judge to require me to hand over the file the judge might very well make me do it and that would be an admission of guilt it could also cost me my license to practice law further any evidence derived from anything in the stolen file could be excluded mordecai and i reviewed the final draft tuesday and he again asked me if i wanted to proceed to protect me he was willing to drop the lawsuit entirely we had talked about that several times we even had a strategy whereby we would drop the burton suit negotiate a truce with drake and sweeney to clear my name wait a year for tempers to cool then sneak the case to a buddy of his on the other side of town it was a bad strategy one we ditched almost as soon as we thought of it he signed the pleadings and we left for the courthouse he drove and i read the lawsuit again the pages growing heavier the farther we went negotiation would be the key the exposure would humiliate drake and sweeney a firm with immense pride and ego and built on credibility client service trustworthiness i knew the mindset the personality the cult of great lawyers who did no wrong i knew the paranoia of being perceived as bad in any way there was guilt for making so much money and a corresponding desire to appear compassionate for the less fortunate drake and sweeney was wrong though i suspected the firm had no idea how very wrong it was i imagined braden chance was cowering behind his locked door praying fervently that the hour would pass but i was wrong too perhaps we could meet in the middle somewhere and cut a deal if not then mordecai green would have the pleasure of presenting the burton case to a friendly jury one day soon and asking them for big bucks and the firm would have the pleasure of pushing my grand larceny case to the limit to a point i didnt care to think about the burton case would never go to trial i could still think like a drake and sweeney lawyer the idea of facing a dc jury would terrify them the initial embarrassment would have them scrambling for ways to cut their losses tim claussen a college pal of abrahams was a reporter for the post he was waiting outside the clerks office and we gave him a copy of the lawsuit he read it while mordecai filed the original then asked us questions which we were more than happy to answer but off the record the burton tragedy was fast becoming a political and social hot potato in the district blame was being passed around with dizzying speed every depaiuiient head in the city blamed another one the city council blamed the mayor who blamed the council while also blaming congress some rightwingers in the house had weighed in long enough to blame the mayor the council and the entire city the idea of pinning the whole thing on a bunch of rich white lawyers made for an astonishing story claussencallous caustic jaded by years in journalism couldnt suppress his enthusiasm the ambush of drake and sweeney by the press did not bother me in the least the firm had established the rules the prior week when it tipped a reporter that i had been arrested i could see rafter and his little band of litigators happily agreeing around the conference table that yes it made perfect sense to alert the media about my arrest and not only that but to slip them a nice photo of the criminal it would embarrass me humiliate me make me sorry force me to cough up the file and do whatever they wanted i knew the mentality knew how the game was played had no problem helping the reporter thirty intake at ccnv alone and two hours late the clients were sitting patiently on the dirty floor of the lobby some nodding off some reading newspapers ernie with the keys was not pleased with my tardiness he had a schedule of his own he opened the intake room and handed me a clipboard with the names of thirteen prospective clients i called the first one i was amazed at how far id come in a week i had walked into the building a few minutes earlier without the fear of being shot i had waited for ernie in the lobby without thinking of being white i listened to my clients patiently but efficiently because i knew what to do i even looked the part my beard was more than a week old my hair was slightly over the ears and showing the first signs of unkemptness my khakis were wrinkled my navy blazer was rumpled my tie was loosened just so the nikes were still stylish but well worn a pair of hornrimmed glasses and i would have been the perfect public interest lawyer not that the clients cared they wanted someone to listen to them and that was my job the list grew to seventeen and i spent four hours counseling i forgot about the coming battle with drake and sweeney i forgot about claire though sadly i was finding that easier to do i even forgot about hector palma and my trip to chicago but i couldnt forget about ruby simon i somehow managed to connect each new client to her i wasnt worried about her safety she had survived on the streets far longer than i could have but why would she leave a clean motel room with a television and a shower and strike out through the city to find her abandoned car she was an addict and that was the plain and unavoidable answer crack was a magnet pulling her back to the streets if i couldnt keep her locked away in suburban motels for three nights then how was i supposed to help her get clean the decision was not mine to make the routine of the late afternoon was shattered by a phone call from my older brother warner he was in town on business unexpectedly wouldve called sooner but couldnt find my new number and where could we meet for dinner he was paying he said before i could answer and hed heard about a great new place called danny os where a friend had eaten just a week earlierfantastic food i hadnt thought about an expensive meal in a long time danny os was fine with me it was trendy loud overpriced sadly typical i stared at the phone long after our conversation was over i did not want to see warner because i did not want to listen to warner he was not in town on business though that happened about once a year i was pretty sure my parents had sent him they were grieving down in memphis heartbroken over another divorce saddened by my sudden fall from the ladder someone had to check on me it was always warner we met in the crowded bar at danny os before we could shake hands or embrace he took a step backward to inspect the new image beard hair khakis everything a real radical he said with an equal mixture of humor and sarcasm its good to see you i said trying to ignore his theatrics you look thin he said you dont he patted his stomach as if a few extra pounds had sneaked on board during the day ill lose it he was thirtyeight nicelooking still very vain about his appearance the mere fact that i had commented on the extra weight would drive him to lose it within a month warner had been single for three years women were very important to him there had been allegations of adultery during his divorce but from both sides you look great i said and he did tailored suit and shirt expensive tie i had a closet full of the stuff you too is this the way you dress for work now for the most part sometimes i ditch the tie we ordered heinekens and sipped them in the crowd hows claire he asked the preliminaries were out of the way i suppose shes fine we filed for divorce uncontested ive moved out is she happy i think she was relieved to get rid of me id say claire is happier today than she was a month ago has she found someone else i dont think so i said i had to be careful because most if not all of our conversation would be repeated to my parents especially any scandalous reason for the divorce they would like to blame claire and if they believed shed been caught screwing around then the divorce would seem logical have you he asked nope ive kept my pants on so why the divorce lots of reasons id rather not rehash them that was not what he wanted his had been a nasty split with both parties fighting for custody of the kids he had shared the details with me often to the point of being boring now he wanted the same in return you woke up one day and decided to get a divorce youve been through it warner its not that simple the maitre d led us deep into the restaurant we passed a table where wayne urnstead was sitting with two men i did not recognize urnstead had been a fellow hostage the one mister had sent to the door to fetch the food the one whod barely missed the snipers bullet he didnt see me a copy of the lawsuit had been served on arthur jacobs chairman of the executive committee at am while i was at the ccnv urnstead was not a partner so i wondered if he even knew about the lawsuit of course he did in hurried meetings throughout the afternoon the news had been dropped like a bomb defenses had to be prepared marching orders given wagons circled not a word to anyone outside the firm on the surface the lawsuit would be ignored fortunately our table could not be seen from umsteads i glanced around to make sure no other bad guys were in the restaurant warner ordered a martini for both of us but i quickly begged off just water for me with warner everything was at full throttle work play food drink women even books and old movies he had almost frozen to death in a blizzard on a peruvian mountain and hed been bitten by a deadly water snake while scuba diving in australia his postdivorce adjustment phase had been remarkably easy primarily because warner loved to travel and hangglide and climb mountains and wrestle sharks and chase women on a global scale as a partner in a large atlanta firm he made plenty of money and he spent a lot of it the dinner was about money water he said in disgust come on have a drink no i protested warner would go from martinis to wine we would leave the restaurant late and he would be up at four fiddling with his laptop shaking off the slight hangover as just another part of the day candy ass he mumbled i browsed the menu he examined every skirt his drink arrived and we ordered tell me about your work he said trying desperately to give the impression that he was interested why because it must be fascinating why do you say that you walked away from a fortune there must be a damned good reason there are reasons and theyre good enough for me warner had planned the meeting there was a purpose a goal a destination and an outline of what he would say to get him there i wasnt sure where he was headed i was arrested last week i said diverting him it was enough of a shock to be successful you what i told him the story stretching it out with every detail because i was in control of the conversation he was critical of my thievery but i didnt try to defend it the file itself was another complicated issue one neither of us wanted to explore so the drake and sweeney bridge has been burned he asked as we ate permanently how long do you plan to be a public interest lawyer ive just started i really hadnt thought about the end why how long can you work for nothing as long as i can survive so survival is the standard for now whats your standard it was a ridiculous question money how much i make how much i spend how much i can stash away somewhere and watch it grow so that one day ill have a shitpot full of it and not have to worry about anything i had heard this before unabashed greed was to be admired it was a slightly cruder version of what wed been taught as children work hard and make plenty and somehow society as a whole would benefit he was daring me to be critical and it was not a fight i wanted it was a fight with no winners only an ugly draw how much do you have i asked as a greedy bastard warner was proud of his wealth when im forty ill have a million bucks buried in mutual funds when im fortyfive itll be three million when im fifty itll be ten and thats when im walking out the door we knew those figures by heart big law firms were the same everywhere what about you he asked as he whittled on freerange chicken well lets see im thirtytwo got a net worth of five thousand bucks give or take when im thirtyfive if i work hard and save money it should be around ten thousand by the time im fifty i should have about twenty thousand buried in mutual funds thats something to look forward to eighteen years of living in poverty you know nothing about poverty maybe i do for people like us poverty is a cheap apartment a used car with dents and dings bad clothing no money to travel and play and see the world no money to save or invest no retirement no safety net nothing perfect you just proved my point you dont know a damned thing about poverty how much will you make this year nine hundred thousand ill make thirty what would you do if someone forced you to work for thirty thousand bucks kill myself i believe that i truly believe you would take a gun and blow your brains out before you would work for thirty thousand bucks youre wrong id take pills coward theres no way i could work that cheap oh you could work that cheap but you couldnt live that cheap same thing thats where you and i are different i said damned right were different but how did we become different michael a month ago you were like me now look at yousilly whiskers and faded clothes all this bullshit about serving people and saving humanity whered you go wrong i took a deep breath and enjoyed the humor of his question he relaxed too we were too civilized to fight in public youre a dumbass you know he said leaning low you were on the fast track for a partnership youre bright and talented single no kids youd be making a million bucks a year at the age of thirtyfive you can do the math its already done wamer ive lost my love for money its the curse of the devil how original let me ask you something what will you do if you wake up one day and youre lets say sixty years old youre tired of saving the world because it cant be saved you dont have a pot to piss in not a dime no firm no partners no wife making big bucks as a brain surgeon nobody to catch you what will you do well ive thought about that and i figure ill have this big brother whos filthy rich so ill give you a call what if im dead put me in your will the prodigal brother we became interested in our food and the conversation waned warner was arrogant enough to think that a blunt confrontation would snap me back to my senses a few sharp insights from him on the consequences of my missteps and i would ditch the poverty act and get a real job ill talk to him i could hear him say to my parents he had a few jabs left he asked what the benefit package was at the th street legal clinic quite lean i told him what about a retirement plan none that i knew of he embraced the opinion that i should spend only a couple of years saving souls before returning to the real world i thanked him and he offered the splendid advice that perhaps i should search for a likeminded woman but with money and marry her we said goodbye on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant i assured him i knew what i was doing that i would be fine and that his report to our parents should be optimistic dont worry them warner tell them everything is wonderful here call me if you get hungry he said in an effort at humor i waved him off and walked away the pylon grill was an allnight coffee shop in foggy bottom near george washington university it was known as a hangout for insomniacs and news addicts the earliest edition of the post arrived each night just before twelve and the place was as busy as a good deli during lunch i bought a paper and sat at the bar which was an odd sight because every person there was buried in the news i was struck by how quiet the pylon was the post had just arrived minutes before me and thirty people were poring over it as if a war had been declared the story was a natural for the post it began on page one under a bold headline and was continued on page ten where the photos werea photo of lontae taken from the placards at the rally for justice one of mordecai when he was ten years younger and a set of three which no doubt would humiliate the bluebloods at drake and sweeney arthur jacobs was in the center a mug shot of tilhnan gantry was on the left and on the right was a mug shot of devon hardy who was linked to the story only because hed been evicted and got himself killed in a newsworthy fashion arthur jacobs and two felons two africanamerican criminals with little numbers across their chests lined up as equals on page ten of the post i could see them huddled in their offices and conference rooms doors locked phones unplugged meetings canceled they would plan their responses devise a hundred different strategies call in their public relations people it would be their darkest hour the fax wars would begin early copies of the trio would be sent to law offices coast to coast and every big firm in the world of corporate law would have a laugh gantry looked extremely menacing and it scared me to think we had picked a fight with him and then there was the photo of me the same one the paper used the saturday before when it announced my arrest i was described as the link between the firm and lontae burton though the reporter had no way of knowing id actually met her the story was long and thorough it began with the eviction and all the participants therein including hardy who surfaced seven days later at the offices of drake and sweeney where he took hostages one of whom was me from me it went to mordecai then to the deaths of the burtons it mentioned my arrest though i had been careful to tell the reporter little about the disputed file he was true to his wordwe were never referred to by name only as informed sources i couldnt have written it better myself not a word from any of the defendants it appeared as if the reporter made little or no effort to contact them thirtyone warner called me at am are you awake he asked he was in his hotel suite hyper bouncing off the walls with a hundred comments and questions about the lawsuit hed seen the paper trying to stay warm in my sleeping bag i listened as he told me exactly how to proceed with the case warner was a litigator a very good one and the jury appeal of the burton case was more than he could stand we hadnt asked for enough in damagesten million wouldnt cut it the right jury and the sky was the limit oh how hed love to try it himself and what about mordecai was he a trial lawyer and the fee surely we had a forty percent contract there might be hope for me after all ten percent i said still in the darkness what ten percent are you out of your mind were a nonprofit firm i tried to explain but he wasnt listening he cursed me for not being greedier the file was a huge problem he said as if we had not thought about it can you prove your case without the file yes he howled with laughter at the sight of old man jacobs sitting there in the paper with a convict on each side his flight to atlanta left in two hours hed be at his desk by nine he couldnt wait to pass around the photos he would start faxing them to the west coast immediately he hung up in the middle of a sentence id slept for three hours i turned a few times but further sleep escaped me there had been too many changes in my life to rest comfortably i showered and left drank coffee with the pakistanis until sunrise then bought cookies for ruby there were two strange cars parked at the corner of fourteenth and q next to our office i drove by slowly at seventhirty and my instincts told me to keep going ruby was not sitting on the front steps if tillman gantry thought violence would somehow help his defense of the lawsuit he wouldnt hesitate to use it mordecai had cautioned me though no warning was necessary i called him at home and told him what i had seen he would arrive at eightthirty and we agreed to meet then he would warn sofia abraham was out of town for two weeks my primary focus had been on the lawsuit there had been other significant distractionsclaire moving out learning the ropes of a new career but the case against riveroaks and my old firm was never far from my mind there was a prefiling frenzy with any large case then a deep breath and a pleasant calmness after the bomb hit and the dust settled gantry didnt kill us the day after we sued him and his two codefendants the office was quite normal the phones were no busier than usual the foot traffic was the same with the lawsuit temporarily set aside my other cases were easier to concentrate on i could only imagine the panic in the marbled halls of drake and sweeney there would be no smiles no gossip by the coffeepot no jokes or sports talk in the hallways a funeral parlor would be rowdier in antitrust those who knew me best would be especially somber polly would be stoic detached and forever efficient rudolph wouldnt leave his office except to huddle with the higherups the only sad aspect of slandering four hundred lawyers was the inescapable reality that almost all of them were not only innocent of wrongdoing but completely ignorant of the facts no one cared what happened in real estate few people knew braden chance i was there seven years before i met the man and then it was only because i went looking for him i felt sorry for the innocent onesthe oldtimers whod built a great firm and trained us well the guys in my class who would carry on the tradition of excellence the rookies who had awakened to the news that their esteemed employer was somehow responsible for wrongful deaths but i felt no sympathy for braden chance and arthur jacobs and donald rafter they had chosen to go for my jugular let them sweat megan took a break from the rigors of keeping order in a house filled with eighty homeless women and we went for a short drive through northwest she had no idea where ruby lived and we didnt really expect to find her it was however a good reason to spend a few minutes together this is not unusual she said trying to reassure me as a rule homeless people are unpredictable especially the addicts youve seen it before ive seen everything you learn to stay level when a client kicks the habit finds a job gets an apartment you say a little prayer of thanks but you dont get excited because another ruby will come along and break your heart there are more valleys than mountains how do you keep from being depressed you draw strength from the clients they are remarkable people most were born without a prayer or a chance yet they survive they trip and fall but they get up and keep trying three blocks from the clinic we passed a mechanics garage with a collection of wrecked vehicles behind it a large toothy dog with a chain around its neck guarded the front i had not planned on poking around rusty old cars and the dog made the decision to keep going an easier one we figured she lived in an area between the dinic on fourteenth and naomis on tenth near l roughly from logan circle to mount vernon square but you never know she said im constantly amazed at how mobile these people are they have plenty of time and some will walk for miles we observed the street people every beggar came under our scrutiny as we drove slowly by we walked through parks looking at the homeless dropping coins in their cups hoping we would see someone we knew no luck i left megan at naomis and promised to call later in the afternoon ruby had become a wonderful excuse to keep in touch the congressman was a fivetermer from indiana a republican named burkholder who had an apartment in virginia but liked to jog in the early evenings around capitol hill his staff informed the media that he showered and changed in one of the seldomused gyms congress built for itself in the basement of a house office building as a member of the house burkholder was one of thus virtually unknown even though hed been in washington ten years he was mildly ambitious squeaky clean a health nut fortyone years old he served on agriculture and chaired a subcommittee of ways and means burkholder was shot early wednesday evening near union station as he jogged alone he was wearing a sweat suitno wallet no cash no pockets with which to carry anything valuable there appeared to be no motive he encountered a street person in some manner perhaps a collision or a bump or a harsh word given or received and two shots were fired one missed the congressman the other struck him in the upper left arm then traveled into his shoulder and stopped very near his neck the shooting occurred not long after dark on a sidewalk next to a street filled with late commuters it was witnessed by four people all of whom described the assailant as a male black homelesslooking type almost a generic description he vanished into the night and by the time the first commuter could stop leave his car and rush to the aid of burkholder the man with the gun was long gone the congressman was rushed to the hospital at george washington where the bullet was removed during a twohour surgery and he was pronounced stable it had been many years since a member of congress had been shot in washington several had been mugged but with no permanent damage the muggings typically provided the victims with wonderful pulpits to rail against crime and the lack of values and the general decline of everything all blame of course being laid at the feet of the opposing party burkholder wasnt able to rail when i saw the story at eleven id been napping in my chair reading and watching boxing it was a slow news day in the district slow until burkholder got shot the news anchorperson breathlessly announced the event giving the basics with a nice photo of the congressman in the background then went live to the hospital where a reporter stood shivering in the cold outside the er entrance a door burkholder had passed through four hours earlier but there was an ambulance in the background and bright lights and since she could not produce blood or a corpse for the viewers she had to make it as sensational as possible the surgery went well she reported burkholder was stable and resting the doctors had released a statement which said basically nothing earlier several of his colleagues had rushed to the hospital and somehow she had been able to coerce them into appearing before the camera three of them stood close together all looking sufficiently grave and somber although burkholders life had never been in danger they squinted at the lights and tried to appear as if it was a major invasion of their private lives i had never heard of any of them they offered their concerns about their buddy and made his condition sound far worse than the doctors without prompting they gave their assessments of the general decline of washington then there was another live report from the scene of the shooting another goofy reporter standing on the exact spot where he fell and now there was really something to see there was a patch of red blood which she pointed to with great drama right down there she squatted and almost touched the sidewalk a cop stepped into the frame and offered his vague summary of what went on the report was live yet in the background there were flashing red and blue lights of police cars i noticed this the reporter did not a sweep was under way the dc police were out in force cleaning the streets shoveling the street people into cars and vans and taking them away throughout the night they swept capitol hill arresting anyone caught sleeping on a bench sitting in a park begging on a sidewalk anyone who obviously appeared to be without a home they charged them with loitering littering public drunkenness panhandling not all were arrested and taken to jail two van loads were driven up rhode island in northeast and dumped in the parking lot next to a community center with an allnight soup kitchen another van carrying eleven people stopped at the calvary ntission on t street five blocks from our office the men were given the choice of going to jail or hitting the streets the van emptied thirtytwo i vowed to get a bed i was losing too much sleep floundering on the floor trying to prove a point to no one but myself in the darkness long before dawn i sat in my sleeping bag and promised myself id find something softer to sleep on i also wondered for the thousandth time how people survived sleeping on sidewalks the pylon grill was warm and stuffy a layer of cigarette smoke not far above the tables the aroma of coffee beans from around the world waiting just inside the door as usual it was filled with news junkies at am burkholder was the man of the hour his face was on the front page of the post and there were several stories about the man the shooting the police investigation nothing about the sweep mordecai would give me those details later a pleasant surprise was waiting in metro tim claussen was evidently a man on a mission our lawsuit had inspired him in a lengthy article he examined each of the three defendants beginning with riveroaks the company was twenty years old privately held by a group of investors one of whom was clayton bender an east coast real estate swinger rumored to be worth two hundred million benders picture was in the story along with a photo of the corporate headquarters in hagerstown maryland the company had built eleven office buildings in the dc area in twenty years along with numerous shopping centers in the suburbs of baltimore and washington the value of its holdings was estimated at three hundred fifty million there was also a lot of bank debt the level of which could not be estimated the history of the proposed bulkmailing facility in northeast was recounted in excruciating detail then on to drake and sweeney not surprisingly there was no source of information from within the firm phone calls had not been returned claussen gave the basicssize history a few famous alumni there were two charts both taken from us law magazine one listing the top ten law firms in the country by size and the other ranking the firms by how much the partners averaged last year in compensation with eight hundred lawyers drake and sweeney was fifth in size and at the partners were number three had i really walked away from that much money the last member of the unlikely trio was tillman gantry and his colorful life made for easy investigative journalism cops talked about him a former cellmate from prison sang his praises a reverend of some stripe in northeast told how gantry had built basketball hoops for poor kids a former prostitute remembered the beatings he operated behind two corporationstag and gantry groupand through them he owned three usedcar lots two small shopping centers an apartment building where two people had been shot to death six rental duplexes a bar where a woman had been raped a video store and numerous vacant lots hed purchased for almost nothing from the city of the three defendants gantry was the only one willing to talk he admitted paying eleven thousand dollars for the florida avenue warehouse in july of the previous year and selling it for two hundred thousand to riveroaks on january he got lucky he said the building was useless but the land under it was worth a lot more than eleven thousand that was why he bought it the warehouse had always attracted squatters he said in fact he had been forced to run them off he had never charged rent and had no idea where that rumor originated he had plenty of lawyers and he would mount a vigorous defense the story did not mention me nothing was said about devon hardy and the hostage drama very little about lontae burton and the allegations of the lawsuit for the second day in a row the venerable old firm of drake and sweeney was maligned as a conspirator with a former pimp indeed the tone of the story portrayed the lawyers as worse criminals than tillman gantry tomorrow it promised there would be another installmenta look at the sad life of lontae burton how long would arthur jacobs allow his beloved firm to be dragged through the mud it was such an easy target the post could be tenacious the reporter was obviously working around the clock one story would lead to another it was twenty minutes past nine when i arrived with my lawyer at the carl moultrie building on the corner of sixth and indiana downtown mordecai knew where we were going i had never been near the moultrie building home of civil and criminal cases in the district the line formed outside the front entrance and it moved slowly as the lawyers and litigants and criminals were searched and scanned for metal devices inside the place was a zooa lobby packed with anxious people and four levels of hallways lined with courtrooms the honorable norman kisner held court on the first floor room number a daily docket by the door listed my name under first appearances eleven other criminals shared space with me inside the bench was vacant lawyers milled about mordecai disappeared into the back and i took a seat in the second row i read a magazine and tried to appear utterly bored with the scene good morning michael someone said from the aisle it was donald rafter clutching his briefcase with both hands behind him was a face i recognized from litigation but i could not recall the name i nodded and managed to say hello they scooted away and found seats on the other side of the courtroom they represented the victims and as such had the right to be present at each stage of my proceedings it was only a first appearance i would stand before the judge while he read the charges i would enter a plea of not guilty be released on my existing bond and leave why was rafter there the answer came slowly i stared at the magazine struggled to remain perfectly calm and finally realized that his presence was merely a reminder they regarded the theft as a serious matter and they would dog me every step of the way rafter was the smartest and meanest of all litigators i was supposed to shake with fear at the sight of him in the courtroom at ninethirty mordecai emerged from behind the bench and motioned for me the judge was waiting in his chambers mordecai introduced me to him and the three of us setfled casually around a small table judge kisner was at least seventy with bushy gray hair and a scraggly gray beard and brown eyes that burned holes as he talked he and my lawyer had been acquaintances for many years i was just telling mordecai he said waving a hand that this is a very unusual case i nodded in agreement it certainly felt unusual to me ive known arthur jacobs for thirty years in fact i know a lot of those lawyers over there theyre good lawyers they were indeed they hired the best and trained them well i felt uncomfortable with the fact that my trial judge had such admiration for the victims a working file stolen from a lawyers office might be hard to evaluate from a monetary point of view its just a bunch of papers nothing of real value to anyone except the lawyer it would be worth nothing if you tried to sell it on the streets im not accusing you of stealing the file you understand yes i understand i wasnt sure if i did or not but i wanted him to continue lets assume you have the file and lets assume you took it from the firm if you returned it now under my supervision i would be inclined to place a value on it of something less than a hundred dollars that of course would be a misdemeanor and we could sweep it under the rug with a bit of paperwork of course you would have to agree to disregard any information taken from the file and what if i dont return it still assuming of course then it becomes much more valuable the grand larceny sticks and we go to trial on that charge if the prosecutor proves his case and the jury finds you guilty it will be up to me to sentence you the creases in his forehead the hardening of his eyes and the tone of his voice left little doubt that sentencing would be something i would rather avoid in addition if the jury finds you guilty of grand larceny you will lose your license to practice law yes sir i said very much chastised mordecai was holding back listening and absorbing everything unlike most of my docket time is crucial here kisner continued this civil litigation could turn on the contents of the file admissibility will be for another judge in another courtroom id like to have the criminal matter resolved before the civil case progresses too far again were assuming you have the file how soon mordecai asked i think two weeks is sufficient time to make your decision we agreed that two weeks was reasonable mordecai and i returned to the courtroom where we waited another hour while nothing happened wan claussen from the post arrived with a rush of lawyers he saw us sitting in the courtroom but did not venture over mordecai moved away from me and eventually cornered him he explained that there were two lawyers in the courtroom from drake and sweeney donald rafter and another guy and perhaps they might have a word for the paper claussen went right after them voices could be heard from the back bench where rafter had been killing time they left the courtroom and continued their argument outside my appearance before kisner was as brief as expected i entered a plea of not guilty signed some forms and left in a hurry rafter was nowhere in sight what did you and kisner talk about before i got back there i asked as soon as we were in the car same thing he told you hes a hardass hes a good judge but he was a lawyer for many years a criminal lawyer and one of the best he has no sympathy for a lawyer who steals the files of another how long will my sentence be if im convicted he didnt say but youll do time we were waiting for a red light fortunately i was driving all right counselor i said what do we do we have two weeks lets approach it slowly now is not the time to make decisions thirtythree there were two stories in the morning post both prominently displayed and accompanied by photos the first was the one promised in yesterdays edition a long history of the tragic life of lontae burton her grandmother was the principal source though the reporter had also contacted two aunts a former employer a social worker a former teacher and her mother and two brothers in prison with its typical aggressiveness and unlimited budget the paper was doing a splendid job of gathering the facts we would need for our case lontaes mother was sixteen when she was born the second of three children all out of wedlock all sired by different men though her mother refused to say anything about her father she grew up in the rough neighborhoods in northeast moving from place to place with her troubled mother living periodically with her grandmother and aunts tier mother was in and out of jail and lontae quit school after the sixth grade from there her life became predictably dismal drugs boys gangs petty crime the dangerous life on the street she worked at various minimumwage jobs and proved to be completely unreliable city records told much of the story an arrest at the age of fourteen for shoplifting processed through juvenile court charged again three months later for public drunkenness juvenile court possession of pot at fifteen juvenile court same charge seven months later arrested for prostitution at the age of sixteen and handled as an adult conviction but no jail arrested for grand larceny stealing a portable cd player from a pawnshop conviction but no jail birth of ontario when she was eighteen at dc general with no father listed on the birth certificate arrested for prostitution two months after ontario arrived convicted but no jail birth of the twins alonzo and dante when she was twenty also at dc general also with no father listed and then temeko the baby with the wet diaper born when lontae was twentyone in the midst of this sad obituary a glimmer of hope sprang forth after temeko arrived lontae stumbled into the house of mary a womens day center similar to naomis where she met a social worker named nell cather ms cather was quoted at length in the story according to her version of lontaes last months she was determined to get off the streets and clean up her life she eagerly began taking birth control pills prodded by the house of mary she desperately wanted to get clean and sober she attended aana meetings at the center and fought her addictions with great courage though sobriety eluded her she quickly improved her reading skills and dreamed of getting a job with a steady paycheck to provide for her little family ms cather eventually found her a job unpacking produce at a large grocery store twenty hours a week at an hour she never missed work one day last fall she whispered to nell cather that she had found a place to live though it must be kept a secret as part of her job nell wanted to inspect the place but lontae refused it wasnt legal she explained it was a small tworoom squatters apartment with a roof and a locked door and a bathroom nearby and she paid a hundred dollars a month in cash i wrote down the name of nell cather at the house of mary and smiled to myself at the thought of her on the witness stand telling the burtons story to a jury lontae became terrified at the thought of losing her children because it happened so often most of the homeless women at the house of mary had lost theirs and the more lontae heard their horror stories the more determined she became to keep her family to gether she studied harder even learned the basics of a computer and once went four days without touching drugs then she was evicted her meager belongings tossed into the street along with her children ms cather saw her the next day and she was a mess the kids were hungry and dirty lontae was stoned the house of mary had a policy forbidding the entry of any person obviously intoxicated or under the influence of drugs the director was forced to ask her to leave ms cather never saw her again not a word until she read about the deaths in the paper as i read the story i thought of braden chance i hoped he was reading it too in the early morning warmth of his fine home in the virginia suburbs i was certain he was awake at such an early hour how could a person under so much pressure sleep at all i wanted him to suffer to realize that his callous disregard for the rights and dignities of others had caused so much misery you were sitting in your nice office braden working hard by the golden hour shuffling papers for your rich clients reading memos from paralegals you sent to do the dirty work and you made the cold calculated decision to proceed with an eviction you should have stopped they were just squatters werent they braden lowly black street people living like animals there was nothing in writing no leases no papers thus no rights toss em any delay in dealing with them might hinder the project i wanted to call him at home jolt him from his morning coffee and say how do you feel now braden the second story was a pleasant surprise at least from a legal point of view it also meant trouble an old boyfriend had been found a nineteenyearold street tough named kito spires his photo would frighten any lawabiding citizen kito had a lot to say he daimed to be the father of lontaes last three childrenthe twins and the baby he had lived with her off and on over the last three years more off than on kito was a typical innercity product an unemployed high school dropout with a criminal record his credibility would always be questioned he had lived in the warehouse with lontae and his children he had helped her pay the rent whenever he could sometime after christmas they had fought and he had left he was currently living with a woman whose husband was in prison he knew nothing about the eviction though he felt it was wrong when asked about conditions in the warehouse kito gave enough details to convince me he had actually been there his description was similar to the one in hectors memo he did not know the warehouse was owned by tillman gantry a dude named johnny collected rent on the fifteenth of each month a hundred bucks mordecai and i would find him soon our witness list was growing and mr spires might well be our star kito was deeply saddened by the deaths of his children and their mother i had watched the funeral very carefully and kito was most certainly not in attendance our lawsuit was getting more press than we could have dreamed of we only wanted ten million dollars a nice round figure that was being written about daily and discussed in the streets lontae had sex with a thousand men kito was the first prospective father with that much money at stake other fathers would soon appear and claim love for their lost children the streets were full of prospects that was the troubling part of his story we would never get the chance to talk to him i called drake and sweeney and asked for braden chance a secretary answered the phone and i repeated my request and whos calling please she asked i gave her a fictitious name and claimed to be a prospective client referred by clayton bender of riveroaks mr chance is unavailable she said tell me when i can talk to him i said rudely hes on vacation fine when will he return im not sure she said and i hung up the vacation would be for a month then it would become a sabbatical then a leave of absence and at some point they would finally admit that chance had been sacked i suspected he was gone the call confirmed it since the firm had been my life for the past seven years it wasnt difficult to predict its actions there was too much pride and arrogance to suffer the indignities being imposed as soon as the lawsuit was filed i suspected they got the truth from braden chance whether he came forth on his own or whether they pried it out of him was immaterial he had lied to them from the beginning and now the entire firm had been sued perhaps he showed them the original memo from hector along with the rent receipt from lontae more than likely though he had destroyed these and was forced to describe what he had shredded the firmarthur jacobs and the executive committeeat last knew the truth the eviction should not have occurred the verbal rental agreements should have been terminated in writing by chance acting for riveroaks with thirty days notice given to the tenants a thirtyday delay would have jeopardized the bulkmail facility at least for riveroaks and a thirtyday delay would have allowed lontae and the other tenants time to survive the worst of winter chance was forced out of the firm undoubtedly with a generous buyout package for his partnership share hector had probably been flown home for briefings with chance gone hector could tell the truth and survive he would not however tell of his contact with me behind locked doors the executive committee had faced reality the firm had enormous exposure a plan of defense was devised with rafter and his litigation team they would defend vigorously on the grounds that the burton case was based on materials stolen from a drake and sweeney file and if the stolen materials couldnt be used in court then the lawsuit should be dismissed that made perfect sense from a legal perspective however before they were able to implement their defense the newspaper intervened witnesses were being found who could testify to the same matters protected in the file we could prove our case regardless of what chance had concealed drake and sweeney had to be in chaos with four hundred aggressive lawyers unwilling to keep their opinions to themselves the firm was on the verge of an insurrection had i still been there and been faced with a similar scandal in another division of the firm i would have been raising hell to get the matter settled and out of the press the option of battening down the hatches and riding out the storm did not exist the exposure by the post was only a sample of what a fullblown trial would entail and a trial was a year away there was heat from another source the file did not indicate the extent to which riveroaks knew the truth about the squatters in fact there was very little correspondence between chance and his client it appeared as though he was given instructions to close the deal as soon as possible riveroaks applied the pressure chance steamrolled ahead if we assumed riveroaks did not know the evictions were wrongful then the company had a legitimate claim for legal malpractice against drake and sweeney it hired the firm to do a job the job was botched and the blunder was to the detriment of the client with three hundred fifty million in holdings riveroaks had sufficient clout to pressure the firm to remedy its wrongs other major clients would also have opinions whats going on over there was a question every partner was hearing from those who paid the bills in the cutthroat world of corporate law vultures from other firms were beginning to circle drake and sweeney marketed its image its public perception all big firms did and no firm could take the hammering being inflicted upon my alma mater congressman burkholder rallied magnificently the day after his surgery he met the press in a carefully staged exhibition they rolled him in a wheelchair to a makeshift podium in the lobby of the hospital he stood with the aid of his pretty wife and stepped forward to issue a statement coincidentally he wore a bright red hoosier sweatshirt there were bandages on his neck a sling over his left arm he pronounced himself alive and well and ready in a few short days to return to his duties on the hill hello to the folks back home in indiana in his finest moment he dwelt on street crime and the deterioration of our cities his hometown had eight thousand peopleit was a shame that our nations capital was in such a sorry state and because of his brush with death he would from that day forward devote his considerable energies into making our streets safe again he had found a new purpose he blathered on about gun control and more prisons the shooting of burkhoider had put immense though temporary pressure on the dc police to clean up the streets senators and representatives had spent the day popping off about the dangers of downtown washington as a result the sweeps started again after dark every drunk wino beggar and homeless person near the capitol was pushed farther away some were arrested others were simply loaded into vans and transported like cattle to the more distant neighborhoods at pm the police were dispatched to a liquor store on fourth street near rhode island in northeast gunshots had been heard by the owner of the store and one of the sidewalk locals had reported seeing a man down in a vacant lot next to the liquor store behind a fifie of rubble and cracked bricks the police found the body of a young black male the blood was fresh and came from two bullet holes to the head he was later identified as kito spires thirtyfour ruby reappeared monday morning with a ferocious appetite for both cookies and news she was waiting on the doorstep with a smile and a warm hello when i arrived at eight a bit later than usual with gantry out there i wanted the extra daylight and the increased activity when i got to the office she looked the same i thought perhaps i could study her face and see the evidence of a crack binge but there was nothing unusual her eyes were hard and sad but she was in a fine mood we entered the office together and fixed our spot on rubys desk it was somewhat comforting to have another person in the building how have you been i asked good she said reaching into a bag for a cookie there were three bags all bought the week before just for her though mordecai had left a trail of crumbs vhere are you staying in my car where else sure am glad winter is leaving me too have you been to naomis i asked no but im going today i aint been feeling too good ill give you a ride thanks the conversation was a little stiff she expected me to ask about her last motel visit i certainly wanted to but thought better of it when the coffee was ready i poured two cups and set them on the desk she was on her third cookie nibbling nonstop around the edges like a mouse how could i be harsh with one so pitiful on to the news how about the paper i asked that would be nice there was a picture of the mayor on the front page and since she liked stories about city politics and since the mayor was always good for some color i selected it first it was a saturday interview in which the mayor and council acting together in a shaky and temporary alliance were asking for a justice department investigation into the deaths of lontae burton and family had there been civil rights violations the mayor strongly implied that he thought so but bring in justice since the lawsuit had taken center stage a fresh new group of culprits was being blamed for the tragedy fingerpointing at city hall had slowed considerably insults to and from congress had stopped those whod felt the heat of the first accusations were vigorously and happily shifting blame to the big law firm and its rich client ruby was fascinated with the burton story i gave her a quick summary of the lawsuit and the fallout since it had been filed drake and sweeney was battered again by the paper its lawyers had to be asking themselves when will it end not for a while on the bottom corner of the front page was a brief story about the postal services decision to halt the bulkmail project in northeast washington the controversy surrounding the purchase of the land the warehouse the litigation involving riveroaks and gantryall were factors in the decision riveroaks lost its twentymilliondollar project riveroaks would react like any other aggressive real estate developer whod spent almost a million dollars in cash purchasing useless innercity property riveroaks would go after its lawyers the pressure swelled some more we scanned world events all earthquake in peru caught rubys attention and we read about it on to metro where the first words i saw made my heart stop under the same photo of kito spires the same except twice as large and even more menacing was the headline kito spires found shot to death the story recounted fridays introduction of mr spires as a player in the burton drama then gave the scant details of his death no witnesses no clues nothing just another street punk shot in the district you okay ruby asked waking me from my trance uh sure i said trying to breathe again why aint you reading because i was too stunned to read aloud i had to quickly scan every word to see if the name of tillman gantry was mentioned it was not and why not it was obvious to me what had happened the kid had enjoyed his moment in the spotlight said too much made trimself too valuable to the plaintiffs case and was too easy a target i read the story to her slowly listening to every sound around us watching the front door hoping mordecai would arrive shortly gantry had spoken other witnesses from the streets would either remain quiet or disappear after we found them killing witnesses was bad enough what would i do if gantry came after the lawyers in the midst of my terror i suddenly realized the story was beneficial to our side of the case we had lost a potentially crucial witness but kitos credibility would have caused problems drake and sweeney was mentioned again in the third story of the morning in connection with the killing of a nineteenyearold criminal the firm had been toppled from its loftiness and was now in the gutter its proud name mentioned in the same paragraphs as murdered street thugs i took myself back a month before mister and everything that followed and i pictured myself reading the same paper at my desk before sunrise and i imagined that i had read the other stories and had learned that the most serious allegations in the lawsuit were indeed true what would i do there was no doubt i would be raising hell with rudolph mayes my supervising partner who likewise would be raising hell with the executive committee and i would be meeting with my peers the other senior associates in the firm we would demand that the matter be settled and laid to rest before more damage was inflicted we would insist that a trial be avoided at all costs we would make all sorts of demands and i suspected most of the senior associates and all the partners were doing exactly what i would be doing with that much racket in the hallways very little work was being done very few hours were being billed the firm was in chaos keep going ruby said again waking me we raced through metro in part because i wanted to see if perhaps there was a fourth story no such luck there was however a story about the street sweeps being conducted by the police in response to the burkholder shooting an advocate for the homeless was bitterly criticizing the operation and threatening litigation ruby loved the story she thought it wonderful that so much was being written about the homeless i drove her to naomis where she was greeted like an old friend the women hugged her and passed her around the room squeezing and even crying i spent a few minutes flirting with megan in the kitchen but my mind was not on romance sofia had a full house when i returned to the office the foot traffic was heavy five clients were sitting against the wall by nine oclock she was on the phone terrorizing someone in spanish i stepped into mordecais office to make sure he had seen the paper he was reading it with a smile we agreed to meet in an hour to discuss the lawsuit i quietly closed my office door and began pulling files in two weeks i had opened ninetyone of them and closed thirtyeight i was falling behind and i needed a hard morning fighting the phone to catch up it would not happen sofia knocked and since the door would not latch she pushed it open while still tapping it no hello no excuse me where is that list of people evicted from the warehouse she asked she had a pencil stuck behind each ear and reading glasses perched on the end of her nose the woman had things to do the list was always nearby i handed it to her and she took a quick look bingo she said what i asked rising to my feet number eight marquis deese she said i thought that name was familiar familiar yes hes sitting at my desk picked up last night in lafayette park across from the white house and dumped at logan circle got caught in a sweep its your lucky day i followed her into the front room where in the center mr deese sat next to her desk he looked remarkably similar to devon hardylate forties grayish hair and beard thick sunshades bundled heavily like most homeless in early march i examined him from a distance as i walked to mordecais office to give him the news we approached him carefully with mordecai in charge of the interrogation excuse me he said very politely im mordecai green one of the lawyers here can i ask you some questions both of us were standing looking down at mr deese he raised his head said i guess so were working on a case involving some people who used to live in an old warehouse at the corner of florida and new york mordecai explained slowly i lived there he said i took a deep breath you did yep got kicked out yes well thats why were involved we represent some of the other people who were kicked out we think the eviction was wrongful you got that right how long did you live there bout three months did you pay rent sure did to who guy named johnny how much a hundred bucks a month cash only why cash didnt want no records do you know who owned the warehouse nope his answer came without hesitation and i had trouble concealing my delight if deese didnt know gantry owned the building how could he be afraid of him mordecai pulled up a chair and got serious with mr deese wed like to have you as a client he said do what were suing some people over the eviction its our position that you folks were done wrong when you got kicked out wed like to represent you and sue on your behalf but the apartment was illegal thats why i was paying in cash doesnt matter we can get you some money how much i dont know yet what have you got to lose nothing i guess i tapped mordecai on the shoulder we excused ourselves and withdrew into his office what is it he asked in light of what happened to kito spires i think we should record his testimony now mordecai scratched his beard not a bad idea lets do an affidavit he can sign it sofia can notarize it then if something happens to him we can fight to get it admitted do we have a tape recorder i asked his eyes shot in all directions yeah somewhere since he didnt know where it was it would take a month to find it how about a video camera i asked not here i thought for a second then said tll run get mine you and sofia keep him occupied hes not going anywhere good give me fortyfive minutes i raced from the office and sped west toward georgetown the third number i tried from my cell phone found claire between classes whats wrong she asked i need to borrow the video camera im in a hurry it hasnt been moved she said very slowly trying to analyze things why a deposition mind if i use it i guess not still in the living room yes have you changed the locks i asked no for some reason this made me feel better i still had a key i could come and go if i wanted what about the alarm code no its the same thanks ill call you later we placed marquis deese in an office empty of furniture but crowded with file cabinets he sat in a chair a blank white wall behind him i was the videographer sofia the notary mordecai the interrogator his answers could not have been more perfect we were finished in thirty minutes all possible questions served up and answered deese thought he knew where two of the other evictees were staying and he promised to find them our plans were to file a separate lawsuit for each evictee we could locate one at a time with plenty of notice to our friends at the post we knew kelvin lain was at the ccnv but he and deese were the only two wed been able to locate their cases were not worth a lot of moneywe would gladly settle them for twentyfive thousand eachbut their filing would heap more misery upon the beleaguered defendants i almost hoped the police would sweep the streets again as deese was leaving mordecai warned him against talking about the lawsuit i sat at a desk near sofia and typed a threepage complaint on behalf of our new client marquis deese against the same three defendants alleging a wrongful eviction then one for kelvin lain i filed the complaints in the computers memory i would simply change the names of the plaintiffs as we found them the phone rang a few minutes before noon sofia was on the other line so i grabbed it legal clinic i said as usual a dignified old voice on the other end said this is arthur jacobs attorney with drake and sweeney i would like to speak to mr mordecai green i could only say sure before punching the hold button i stared at the phone then slowly rose and walked to mordecais door what is it he said his nose was buried in the us code arthur jacobs is on the phone who is he drake and sweeney we stared at each other for a few seconds then he smiled this could be the call he said i just nodded he reached for the phone and i sat down it was a brief conversation with arthur doing most of the talking i gathered that he wanted to meet and talk about the lawsuit and the sooner the better after it was over mordecai replayed it for my benefit they would like to sit down tomorrow and have a little chat about settling the lawsuit where at their place ten in the morning without your presence i didnt expect to be invited are they worried i asked of course theyre worried they have twenty days before their answer is due yet theyre already calling about a settlement they are very worried thirtyfive i spent the following morning at the redeemer mission counseling clients with all the finesse of one whod spent years tending to the legal problems of the homeless temptation overcame me and at elevenfifteen i called sofia to see if she had heard from mordecai she had not we expected the meeting at drake and sweeney to be a long one i was hoping that by chance he had called in to report everything was proceeding smoothly no such luck typically i had slept little though the lack of sleep had nothing to do with physical ailments or discomfort my anxiety over the setdement meeting outlasted a long hot bath and a bottle of wine my nerves were jumping as i counseled my clients it was difficult to concentrate on food stamps housing subsidies and delinquent fathers when my life was hanging in the balance on another front i left when lunch was ready my presence was far less important than the daily bread i bought two plain bagels and a bottle of water and drove the beltway for an hour when i returned to the clinic mordecais car was parked beside the building he was in his office waiting for me i closed the door the meeting took place in arthur jacobs personal conference room on the eighth floor in a hallowed corner of the building id never been near mordecai was treated like a visiting dignitary by the receptionist and staffhis coat was quickly taken his coffee mixed just right fresh muffins available he sat on one side of the table facing arthur donald rafter an attorney for the firms malpractice insurance carrier and an attorney for riveroaks tillman gantry had legal representation but they had not been invited if there was a settlement no one expected gantry to contribute a dime the only odd slot in the lineup was the lawyer for riveroaks but it made sense the companys interests were in conflict with the firms mordecai said the ill will was obvious arthur handled most of the talking from his side of the table and mordecai had trouble believing the man was eighty years old the facts were not only memorized but instantly recalled the issues were analyzed by an extremely sharp mind working overtime first they agreed that everything said and seen in the meeting would remain strictly confidential no admission of liability would survive the day no offer to settle would be legally binding until documents were signed arthur began by saying the defendants especially drake and sweeney and riveroaks had been blindsided by the lawsuitthey were rattled and reeling and unaccustomed to the humiliation and to the battering they were taking in the press he spoke very frankly about the distress his beloved firm was suffering mordecai just listened as he did throughout most of the meeting arthur pointed out that there were a number of issues involved he started with braden chance and revealed that chance had been expelled by the firm he did not withdraw he was kicked out arthur spoke candidly about chances misdeeds he was solely in charge of all riveroaks matters he knew every aspect of the tag closing and monitored every detail he probably committed malpractice when he allowed the eviction to proceed probably mordecai said well okay then beyond probably chance did not meet the necessary level of professional responsibility by proceeding with the eviction and he doctored the file and he attempted to cover up his actions he lied to them plain and simple arthur admitted with no small amount of discomfort had chance been truthful after misters hostage crisis the firm could have prevented the lawsuit and its resulting flood of bad press chance had embarrassed them deeply and he was history how did he doctor the file mordecai asked the other side wanted to know if mordecai had seen the file where exactly was the damned thing he was not responsive arthur explained that certain papers had been removed have you seen hector palmas memo of january twentyseventh mordecai asked and they went rigid no came the response delivered by arthur so chance had in fact removed the memo along with lontaes receipt and fed them to the shredder with great ceremony and relishing every second of it mordecai removed from his briefcase several copies of the memo and receipt he majestically slid them across the table where they were snatched up by hardened lawyers too terrified to breathe there was a long silence as the memo was read then examined then reread then finally analyzed desperately for loopholes and words which might be lifted out of context and slanted toward their side of the table nothing doing hectors words were too clear his narrative too descriptive may i ask where you got this asked arthur politely thats not important at least for now it was obvious they had been consumed with the memo chance had described its contents on his way out the door and the original had been destroyed but what if copies had been made they were holding the copies in disbelief but because they were seasoned litigators they rallied nicely laying the memo aside as if it were something they could handle effectively at a later date i guess that brings us to the missing file arthur said anxious to find more solid footing they had an eyewitness who had seen me near chances office the night i took the file they had fingerprints they had the mysterious file from my desk the one that had held the keys i had gone to chance demanding to see the riveroakstag file there was motive but there are no eyewitnesses mordecai said its all circumstantial do you know where the file is arthur asked no we have no interest in seeing michael brock go to jail then why are you pressing criminal charges everythings on the table mr green if we can resolve the lawsuit we can also dispose of the criminal matter thats wonderful news how do you propose we settle the lawsuit rafter slid over a tenpage summary filled with multicolored graphs and charts all designed to convey the argument that children and young uneducated mothers are not worth much in wrongfuldeath litigation wlth typical bigfirm thoroughness the minions at drake and sweeney had spent untold hours spanning the nation to survey the latest trends in tort compensation a oneyear trend a fiveyear trend a tenyear trend region by region state by state city by city how much were juries awarding for the deaths of preschoolers not very much the national average was fortyfive thousand dollars but much lower in the south and midwest and slightly higher in california and in larger cities preschoolers do not work do not earn money and the courts generally do not allow predictions about future earning capacity lontaes estimate of lost earnings was quite liberal with a spotty employment history some weighty assumptions were made she was twentytwo and she would one day very soon find fulltime employment at minimum wage that was a generous assumption but one rafter was willing to grant she would remain clean sober and free of pregnancy for the remainder of her working life another charitable theory she would find training somewhere along the way move into a job paying twice as much as minimum wage and keep said job until she was sixtyfive adjusting her future earnings for inflation then translating to present dollars rafter arrived at the sum of for lontaes loss of earnings there were no injuries or burns no pain and suffering they died in their sleep to settle the case and admitting no wrongdoing whatsoever the firm generously offered to pay per child plus the full sum of lontaes earnings for a total of thats not even close mordecai said i can get that much out of a jury for one dead kid they sank in their seats he went on to discredit almost everything in rafters pretty little report he didnt care what juries were doing in dallas or seattle and failed to see the relevance he had no interest in judicial proceedings in omaha he knew what he could do with a jury in the district and that was all that mattered if they thought they could buy their way out cheaply then it was time for him to leave arthur reasserted himself as rafter looked for a hole its negotiable he said its negotiable the survey made no allowance for punitive damages and mordecai brought this to their attention you got a wealthy lawyer from a wealthy firm deliberately allowing a wrongful eviction to occur and as a direct result my clients got tossed into the streets where they died trying to stay warm frankly gentlemen its a beautiful punitive damages case especially here in the district here in the district meant only one thing a black jury we can negotiate arthur said again what figure do you have in mind we had debated what number to first place on the table we had sued for ten million dollars but we had pulled the number out of the air it couldve been forty or fifty or a hundred a million for each of them mordecai said the words fell heavily on the mahogany table those on the other side heard them clearly but it took seconds for things to register five million rafter asked just barely loud enough to be heard five million boomed mordecai one for each of the victims the legal pads suddenly caught their attention and all four wrote a few sentences after a while arthur reentered the fray by explaining that our theory of liability was not absolute an interveiling act of naturethe snowstormwas partly responsible for the deaths a long discussion about weather followed mordecai settled the issue by saying the jurors will know that it snows in february that its cold in february that we have snowstorms in february throughout the meeting any reference by him to the jury or the jurors was always followed by a few seconds of silence on the other side they are horrified of a trial he told me our theory was strong enough to withstand their attacks he explained to them either through intentional acts or gross negligence the eviction was carried out it was foreseeable that our clients would be forced into the streets with no place to live in february he could convey this wonderfully simple idea to any jury in the country but it would especially appeal to the good folks in the district weary of arguing liability arthur moved to their strongest handme specifically my actions in taking the file from chances office and doing so after being told i couldnt have it their position was not negotiable they were willing to drop the criminal charges if a settlement could be reached in the civil suit but i had to face disciplinary action on their ethics complaint what do they want i asked a twoyear suspension mordecai said gravely i couldnt respond two years nonnegotiable i told them they were nuts he said but not as emphatically as i would have liked no way it was easier to remain silent i kept repeating to myself the words two years two years they jockeyed some more on the money without closing the gap actually they agreed on nothing except for a plan to meet again as soon as possible the last thing mordecai did was hand them a copy of the marquis deese lawsuit yet to be filed it listed the same three defendants and demanded the paltry sum of fifty thousand dollars for his wrongful eviction more would follow mordecai promised them in fact our plans were to file a couple each week until all evictees had been accounted for you plan to provide a copy of this to the newspapers rafter asked why not mordecai said once its fled its public record its just that well weve had enough of the press you started the pissing contest what you leaked the story of michaels arrest we did not then how did the post get his photograph arthur told rafter to shut up alone in my office with the door closed i stared at the walls for an hour before the settlement began to make sense the firm was willing to pay a lot of money to avoid two things further humiliation and the spectacle of a trial that could cause serious financial damage if i handed over the file they would drop the criminal charges everything would fold neatly into place except that the firm wanted some measure of satisfaction i was not only a turncoat but in their eyes i was responsible for the entire mess i was the link between their dirty secrets well hidden up in the tower and the exposure the lawsuit had cast upon them the public disgrace was reason enough to hate me the prospect of stripping them of their beloved cash was fueling their hunger for revenge and i had done it all with inside information at least in their collective opinion apparently they did not know of hectors involvement i had stolen the file found everything i needed then pieced together the lawsuit i was judas sadly i understood them thirtysix long after sofia and abraham had left i was sitting in the semidarkness of my office when mordecai walked through the door and setfled into one of two sturdy folding chairs id bought at a flea market for six bucks a matching pair a prior owner had painted them maroon they were quite ugly but at least i had stopped worrying about clients and visitors collapsing in midsentence i knew he had been on the phone all afternoon but i had stayed away from his office ive had lots of phone calls he said things are moving faster than we ever thought i was listening with nothing to say back and forth with arthur back and forth with judge deorio do you know deorio no hes a tough guy but hes good fair moderately liberal started with a big firm many years ago and for some reason decided he wanted to be a judge passed up the big bucks he moves more cases than any trial judge in the city because he keeps the lawyers under his thumb very heavyhanded wants everything settled and if a case cant be settled then he wants the trial as soon as possible hes obsessive about a clean docket i think ive heard his name i would hope so youve practiced law in this city for seven years antitrust law in a big firm way up there anyway heres the upshot weve agreed to meet at one tomorrow in deorios courtroom everybody will be therethe three defendants with counsel me you our trustee everybody with any interest whatsoever in the lawsuit me yep the judge wants you present he said you could sit in the jury box and watch but he wants you there and he wants the missing file gladly he is notorious in some circles i guess for hating the press he routinely tosses reporters from his courtroom bans tv cameras from within a hundred feet of his doors hes already irritated with the notoriety this case has generated hes determined to stop the leaks the lawsuit is a public record yes but he can seal the file if hes so inclined i dont think he will but he likes to bark so he wants it settled of course he does hes a judge isnt he every judge wants every case settled more time for golf what does he think of our case he kept his cards close but he was adamant that all three defendants be present and not just flunkies well see the people who can make decisions on the spot gantry gantry will be there i talked to his lawyer does he know they have a metal detector at the front door probably hes been to court before arthur and i told the judge about their offer he didnt react but i dont think he was impressed hes seen a lot of big verdicts he knows his jurors what about me there was a long pause froin my friend as he struggled to find words that would be at once truthful yet soothing hell take a hard line nothing soothing about that whats fair mordecai its my neck on the line ive lost perspective its not a question of fairness you took the file to right a wrong you did not intend to steal it just borrow it for an hour or so it was an honorable act but still a theft did deorio refer to it as a theft he did once so the judge thought i was a thief it was becoming unanimous i didnt have the guts to ask mordecai his opinion he might tell me the truth and i didnt want to hear it he shifted his considerable weight my chair popped but didnt yield an inch i was proud of it i want you to know something he said soberly you say the word and well walk away from this case in the blink of an eye we dont need the settlement no one does really the victims are dead their heirs are either unknown or in jail a nice settlement wili not affect my life in the slightest its your case you make the call its not that simple mordecai why isnt it im scared of the criminal charges you should be but theyll forget the criminal charges theyll forget the bar complaint i could call arthur right now and tell him we would drop everything if they would drop everything both sides walk away and forget it he would jump at it its a piece of cake the press would eat us alive so were immune you think our clients worry about what the post says about us he was playing the devils advocatearguing points he didnt really believe in mordecai wanted to protect me but he also wanted to nail drake and sweeney some people cannot be protected from themselves all right we walk away i said and what have we accomplished they get away with murder they threw those people in the street theyre solely responsible for the wrongful evictions and ultimately responsible for the deaths of our clients yet we let them off the hook is that what were talking about its the only way to protect your license to practice law nothing like a little pressure mordecai i said a bit too harshly but he was right it was my mess and only fitting that i make the crucial decisions i took the file a stupid act that was legally and ethically wrong mordecai green would be devastated if i suddenly got cold feet his entire world was helping poor folks pick themselves up his people were the hopeless and homeless those given little and seeking only the basics of lifethe next meal a dry bed a job with a dignified wage a small apartment with affordable rent rarely could the cause of his clients problems be so directly traced to large private enterprises since money meant nothing to mordecai and since a large recovery would have little or no impact on his life and since the clients were as he said either dead unknown or in jail he would never consider a pretrial settlement absent my involvement mordecai wanted a trial an enormous noisy production with lights and cameras and printed words focused not on him but on the declining plight of his people trials are not always about individual wrongs they are sometimes used as pulpits my presence complicated matters my soft pale face could be the one behind bars my license to practice law and thus make a living was at risk im not jumping ship mordecai i said i didnt expect you to let me give you a scenario what if we convince them to pay a sum of money we can live with the criminal charges are dropped and theres nothing left on the table but me and my license and what if i agree to surrender it for a period of time what happens to me first you suffer the indignity of a disciplinary suspension which unpleasant as it sounds will not be the end of the world i said trying to sound strong i was horrified about the embarrassment wamer my parents my friends my law school buddies claire all those fine folks at drake and sweeney their faces rushed before my eyes as i saw them receive the news second you simply cant practice law during the suspension will i lose my job of course not then what will i do well youll keep this office youll do intake at ccnv samaritan house redeemer mission and the other places youve already been to you will remain a full partner with the clinic well call you a social worker not a lawyer so nothing changes not much look at sofia she sees more clients than the rest of us combined and half the city thinks shes a lawyer if a court appearance is necessary i handle it itll be the same for you the rules governing street law were written by those who practiced it what if i get caught no one cares the line between social work and social law is not always clear two years is a long time it is and it isnt we dont have to agree on a twoyear suspension i thought it was not negotiable tomorrow everything will be negotiable but you need to do some research find similar cases if theyre out there see what other jurisdictions have done with similar complaints you think its happened before maybe there are a million of us now lawyers have been ingenious in finding ways to screw up he was late for a meeting i thanked him and we locked up together i drove to the georgetown law school near capitol hill the library was open until midnight it was the perfect place to hide and ponder the life of a wayward lawyer thirtyseven deorios courtroom was on the second floor of the carl moultrie building and getting there took us close to judge kisners where my grand larceny case was awaiting the next step in a cumbersome process the halls were busy with criminal lawyers and lowend hamandeggers the ones who advertise on cable tv and bus stop benches they huddled with their clients almost all of whom looked guilty of something and i refused to believe that my name was on the same docket with those thugs the timing of our entry was important to mesilly to mordecai we didnt dare flirt with tardiness deorio was a fanatic for punctuality but i couldnt stomach the thought of arriving ten minutes early and being subjected to the stares and whispers and perhaps even the banal pregame chitchat of donald rafter and arthur and hell only knew who else they would bring i had no desire to be in the room with tillman gantry unless his honor was present i wanted to take my seat in the jury box listen to it all and not be bothered by anyone we entered at two minutes before one deorios law clerk was passing out copies of the agenda she directed us to our seatsme to the jury box where i sat alone and content and mordecai to the plaintiffs table next to the jury box wilma phelan the trustee was already there and already bored because she had no input into anything about to be discussed the defense table was a study in strategic positioning drake and sweeney was clustered at one end tillman gantry and his two lawyers at the other holding the center and acting as a buffer were two corporate types from riveroaks and three lawyers the agenda also listed the names of all present i counted thirteen for the defense i expected gantry being an expimp to be adorned with rings on his fingers and ears and bright gaudy clothing not so he wore a handsome navy suit and was dressed better than his lawyers he was reading documents and ignoring everyone i saw arthur and rafter and nathan malamud and barry nuzzo i was determined that nothing would surprise me but i had not expected to see barry by sending three of my fellow exhostages the firm was delivering a subtle messageevery other lawyer terrorized by mister survived without cracking upwhat happened to me why was i the weak sister the fifth person in their pack was identified as l james suber an attorney for an insurance company drake and sweeney was heavily insured against malpractice but i doubted if the coverage would apply the policy excluded intentional acts such as stealing by an associate or partner or deliberately violating a standard of conduct negligence by a firm lawyer would be covered willful wrongdoing would not braden chance had not simply overlooked a statute or code provision or established method of practice he had made the conscious decision to proceed with the eviction in spite of being fully informed that the squatters were in fact tenants there would be a nasty fight on the side out of our flew between drake and sweeney and its malpractice carrier let em fight at precisely one judge deorio appeared from behind the bench and took his seat good afternoon he said gruffly as he settled into place he was wearing a robe and that struck me as odd it was not a formal court proceeding but an unofficial settlement conference he adjusted his microphone and said mr burdick please keep the door locked mr burdick was a uniformed courtroom deputy guarding the door from the inside the pews were completely empty it was a very private conference a court reporter began recording every word i am informed by my clerk that all parties and lawyers are now present he said glancing at me as if i were just another rapist the purpose of this meeting is to attempt to settle this case after numerous conversations yesterday with the principal attorneys it became apparent to me that a conference such as this held at this time might be beneficial ive never had a settlement conference so soon after the filing of a complaint but since all parties agreed it is time well spent the first issue is that of confidentiality nothing we say today can be repeated to any member of the press under any circumstances is that understood he looked at mordecai and then at me all necks from the defense table twisted for similar scrutiny i wanted to stand and remind them that they had initiated the practice of leaking wed certainly landed the heaviest blows but they had thrown the first punch the clerk then handed each of us a twoparagraph nondisclosure agreement customized with our names plugged in i signed it and gave it back to her a lawyer under pressure cannot read two paragraphs and make a quick decision is there a problem deorio asked of the drake and sweeney crowd they were looking for loopholes it was the way we were trained they signed off and the agreements were gathered by the clerk well work from the agenda the judge said item one is a summary of the facts and theories of liability mr green you filed the lawsuit you may proceed you have five minutes mordecai stood without notes hands stuck deep in pockets completely at ease in two minutes he stated our case clearly then sat down deorio appreciated brevity arthur spoke for the defendants he conceded the factual basis for the case but took issue on the question of liability he laid much of the blame on the freak snowstorm that covered the city and made life difficult for everyone he also questioned the actions of lontae burton there were places for her to go arthur said there were emergency shelters open the night before she had stayed in the basement of a church along with many other people why did she leave i dont know but no one forced her at least no one weve been able to find so far her grandmother has an apartment in northeast shouldnt some of the responsibility rest with the mother shouldnt she have done more to protect her little family it would be arthurs only chance to cast blame upon a dead mother in a year or so my jury box would be filled with people who looked different from me and neither arthur nor any lawyer in his right mind would imply that lontae burton was even partially to blame for killing her own children why was she in the street to begin with deorio asked sharply and i almost smiled arthur was unfazed for purposes of this meeting your honor we are willing to concede that the eviction was wrongful thank you youre welcome our point is that some of the responsibility should rest with the mother how much at least fifty percent thats too high we think not your honor we may have put her in the street but she was there for more than a week before the tragedy mr green mordecai stood shaking his head as if arthur were a firstyear law student grappling with elementary theories these are not people with immediate access to housing mr jacobs thats why theyre called homeless you admit you put them in the street and thats where they died i would love to discuss it with a jury arthurs shoulders slumped rafter malamud and barry listened to every word their faces stricken with the notion of mordecai green loose in a courtroom with a jury of his peers liability is clear mr jacobs deorio said you can argue the mothers negligence to the jury if you want though i wouldnt advise it mordecai and arthur sat down if at trial we proved the defendants liable the jury would then consider the issue of damages it was next on the agenda rafter went through the motions of submitting the same report on current trends in jury awards he talked about how much dead children were worth under our tort system but he quickly became tedious when discussing lontaes employment history and the estimated loss of her future earnings tie arrived at the same amount that they had offered the day before and presented that for the record thats not your final offer is it mr rafter deorio asked his tone was challenging he certainly hoped that was not their final offer no sir rafter said mr green mordecai stood again we reject their offer your honor the trends mean nothing to me the only trend i care about is how much i can convince a jury to award and with all due respect to mr rafter itll be a helluva lot more than what theyre offering no one in the courtroom doubted him he disputed their view that a dead child was worth only fifty thousand dollars he implied rather strongly that such a low estimation was the result of a prejudice against homeless street children who happened to be black gantry was the only one at the defense table not squirming you have a son at st albans mr rafter would you take fifty thousand for him rafters nose was three inches away from his legal pad i can convince a jury in this courtroom that these little children were worth at least a million dollars each same as any child in the prep schools of virginia and maryland it was a nasty shot one they took in the groin there was no doubt where their kids went to school rafters summary made no provision for the pain and suffering of the victims the rationale was unspoken but nonetheless obvious they had died peacefully breathing odorless gas until they floated away there were no burns breaks blood rafter paid dearly for his omission mordecai launched into a detailed account of the last hours of lontae and her children the search for food and warmth the snow and bitter cold the fear of freezing to death the desperate efforts to stay together the horror of being stuck in a snowstorm in a rattletrap car motor running watching the fuel gauge it was a spellbinding performance given off the cuff with the skill of a gifted storyteller as the lone juror i would have handed him a blank check dont tell me about pain and suffering he snarled at drake and sweeney you dont know the meaning of it he talked about lontae as if hed known her for years a kid born without a chance who made all the predictable mistakes but more important a mother who loved her children and was trying desperately to climb out of poverty she had confronted her past and her addictions and was fighting for sobriety when the defendants kicked her back into the streets his voice ebbed and flowed rising with indignation falling with shame and guilt not a syllable was missed no wasted words he was giving them an extraordinary dose of what the jury would hear arthur had control of the checkbook and it mustve been burning a hole in his pocket mordecai saved his best for last he lectured on the purpose of punitive damagesto punish wrongdoers to make examples out of them so they would sin no more he hammered at the evils committed by the defendants rich people with no regard for those less fortunate theyre just a bunch of squatters his voice boomed lets throw them out greed had made them ignore the law a proper eviction would have taken at least thirty more days it would have killed the deal with the postal service thirty days and the heavy snows wouldve been gone the streets wouldve been a little safer it was the perfect case for the levying of punitive damages and there was little doubt in his mind a jury would agree with him i certainly did and at that moment neither arthur nor rafter nor any other lawyer sitting over there wanted any part of mordecai green well settle for five million he said as he came to an end not a penny less there was a pause when he finished deorio made some notes then returned to the agenda the matter of the file was next do you have it he asked me yes sir are you willing to hand it over yes mordecai opened his battered briefcase and removed the file he handed it to the clerk who passed it up to his honor we watched for ten long minutes as deorio flipped through every page i caught a few stares from rafter but who cared he and the rest were anxious to get their hands on it when the judge was finished he said the file has been returned mr jacobs there is a criminal matter pending down the hall ive spoken to judge kisner about it what do you wish to do your honor if we can settle all other issues we will not push for an indictment i assume this is agreeable with you mr brock deorio said damned right it was agreeable with me yes sir moving right along the next item is the matter of the ethics complaint filed by drake and sweeney against michael brock mr jacobs would you care to address this certainly your honor arthur sprang to his feet and delivered a condemnation of my ethical shortcomings he was not unduly harsh or longwinded he seemed to get no pleasure from it arthur was a lawyers lawyer an oldtimer who preached ethics and certainly practiced them he and the firm would never forgive me for my screwup but i had been after all one of them just as braden chances actions had been a reflection on the entire firm so had my failure to maintain certain standards he ended by asserting that i must not escape punishment for taking the file it was an egregious breach of duty owed to the client riveroaks i was not a criminal and they had no difficulty in forgetting the grand larceny charge but i was a lawyer and a damned good one he admitted and as such i should be held responsible they would not under any circumstances withdraw the ethics complaint his arguments were well reasoned well pled and he convinced me the folks from riveroaks seemed especially hardnosed mr brock deorio said do you have any response i had not prepared any remarks but i wasnt afraid to stand and say what i felt i looked arthur squarely in the eyes and said mr jacobs i have always had great respect for you and i still do i have nothing to say in my defense i was wrong in taking the file and ive wished a thousand times i had not done it i was looking for information which i knew was being concealed but that is no excuse i apologize to you the rest of the firm and to your client riveroaks i sat down and couldnt look at them mordecai told me later that my humility thawed the room by ten degrees deorio then did a very wise thing he proceeded to the next item which was the litigation yet to be commenced we planned to file suit on behalf of marquis deese and kelvin lam and eventually for every other evictee we could find devon hardy and lontae were gone so there were fifteen potential plaintiffs out there this had been promised by mordecai and he had informed the judge if youre conceding liability mr jacobs his honor said then you have to talk about damages how much will you offer to settle these other fifteen cases arthur whispered to rafter and malamud then said well your honor we figure these people have been without their homes for about a month now if we gave them five thousand each they could find a new place probably something much better thats low deorio said mr green much too low mordecai agreed again i evaluate cases based on what juries might do same defendants same wrongful conduct same jury pool i can get fifty thousand per case easy what will you take the judge asked twentyfive thousand i think you should pay it deorio said to arthur its not unreasonable twentyfive thousand to each of the fifteen arthur asked his unflappable demeanor cracking under the assault from two sides of the courtroom thats right a fierce huddle ensued in which each of the four drake and sweeney lawyers had his say it was telling that they did not consult the attorneys for the other two defendants it was obvious the firm would foot the bill for the settlement gantry seemed completely indifferent his money was not at stake riveroaks had probably threatened a suit of its own against the lawyers if the case wasnt settled we will pay twentyfive arthur announced quietly and left the coffers of drake and sweeney the wisdom was in the breaking of the ice deorio knew he could force them to settle the smaller claims once the money started flowing it wouldnt stop until we were finished for the prior year after paying my salary and benefits and setting aside one third of my billings for the overhead approximately four hundred thousand dollars went into the pot of gold the partners divided and i was just one of eight hundred gentlemen we are down to two issues the first is moneyhow much will it take to settle this lawsuit the second is the matter of mr brocks disciplinary problems it appears as though one hinges on the other its at this point in these meetings that i like to talk privately with each side ill start with the plaintiff mr green and mr brock would you step into my chambers the clerk escorted us into the hallway behind the bench then down to a splendid oakpaneled office where his honor was disrobing and ordering tea from a secretary he offered some to us but we declined the clerk closed the door leaving us alone with deorio were making progress he said ive got to tell you mr brock the ethics complaint is a problem do you realize how serious it is i think so he cracked his knuckles and began pacing around the room we had a lawyer here in the district must have been seven eight years ago who pulled a similar stunt walked out of a firm with a bunch of discovery materials that mysteriously ended up in a different firm which just so happened to offer the guy a nice job cant remember the name makovek brad makovek i said right what happened to him suspended for two years which is what they want from you no way judge mordecai said no way in hell were agreeing to a twoyear suspension how much will you agree to six months max and its not negotiable look judge these guys are scared to death you know that theyre scared and were not why should we settle anything id rather have a jury theres not going to be a jury the judge stepped close to me and studied my eyes youll agree to a sixmonth suspension he asked yes i said but they have to pay the money how much money he asked mordecai five million i could get more from a jury deorio walked to his window deep in thought scratching his chin i can see five million from a jury he said without turning around i can see twenty mordecai said wholl get the money the judge asked itll be a nightmare mordecai admitted how much in attorneys fees twenty percent half of which goes to a trust in new york the judge snapped around and began pacing again hands clenched behind his head six months is light he said thats all were giving mordecai retorted all right let me talk to the other side our private session with deorio lasted less than fifteen minutes for the bad guys it took an hour of course they were the ones forking over the money we drank colas on a bench in the bustling lobby of the building saying nothing as we watched a million lawyers scurry about chasing clients and justice we walked the halls and looked at the scared people about to be hauled before the bench for a variety of offenses mordecai spoke to a couple of lawyers he knew i recognized no one bigfirm lawyers did not spend time in superior court the clerk found us and led us back to the courtroom where all players were in place things were tense deorio was agitated arthur and company looked exhausted we took our seats and waited for the judge mr green he began i have met with the lawyers for the defendants heres their best offer the sum of three million dollars and a oneyear suspension for mr brock mordecai had barely settled into his seat when he bounced forward then were wasting our time he said and grabbed his briefcase i jumped up to follow him please excuse us your honor he said but we have better things to do we started for the aisle between the pews youre excused the judge said very frustrated we left the courtroom in a rush thirtyeight i was unlocking the car when the cell phone rattled in my pocket it was judge deorio mordecai laughed when i said yes judge well be there in five minutes we took ten stopping in the rest rooms on the ground floor walking slowly using the stairs giving deorio as much time as possible to further pummel the defendants the first thing i noticed when we entered the courtroom was that jack bolling one of the three attorneys for riveroaks had removed his jacket rolled up his sleeves and was walking away from the drake and sweeney lawyers i doubted if he had physically slapped them around but he looked willing and able the huge verdict mordecai dreamed about would be lodged against all three defendants evidently riveroaks had been sufficiently frightened by the settlement conference threats had been made and perhaps the company had decided to chip in with some cash of its own we would never know i avoided the jury box and sat next to mordecai wilma phelan had left were getting close the judge said and were thinking of withdrawing our offer mordecai announced with one of his more violent barks we had not discussed such a thing and neither the other lawyers nor his honor had contemplated it their heads jerked as they looked at each other settle down deorio said im very serious judge the more i sit here in this courtroom the more convinced i am that this travesty needs to be revealed to a jury as for mr brock his old firm can push all it wants on the criminal charges but its no big deal they have their file back he has no criminal record god knows our system is overloaded with drug dealers and murderers prosecuting him will become a joke he will not go to jail and the bar complaintlet it run its course ill file one against braden chance and maybe some of the other lawyers involved in this mess and well have us an oldfashioned spitting contest he pointed at arthur and said you run to the newspaper we run to the newspaper the th street legal clinic couldnt care less what was printed about it if gantry cared he wouldnt show it riveroaks could continue to make money in spite of bad press but drake and sweeney had only its reputation to market mordecais tirade came from nowhere and they were completely astonished by it are you finished deorio asked i guess good the offer is up to four million if they can pay four million then they can certainly pay five mordecai pointed again back to drake and sweeney this defendant had gross billings last year of almost seven hundred million dollars he paused as the numbers echoed around the courtroom seven hundred million dollars last year alone then he pointed at riveroaks and this defendant owns real estate worth three hundred and fifty million dollars give me a jury when it appeared that he was silent deorio again asked are you finished no sir he said and in an instant became remarkably calm well take two million up front a million for our fees a million for the heirs the balance of three million can be spread over the next ten yearsthree hundred thousand a year plus a reasonable interest rate surely these defendants can spare three hundred thousand bucks a year they may be forced to raise rents and hourly rates but they certainly know how to do that a structured settlement with an extended payout made sense because of the instability of the heirs and the fact that most of them were still unknown the money would be carefully guarded by the court mordecais latest onslaught was nothing short of brilliant there was a noticeable relaxing in the drake and sweeney group he had given them a way out jack bolling huddled with them gantrys lawyers watched and listened but were almost as bored as their client we can do that arthur announced but we keep our position regarding mr brock its a oneyear suspension or theres no settlement i suddenly hated arthur again i was their last pawn and to save what little face they had left they wanted all the blood they could squeeze but poor arthur was not negotiating from a position of power he was desperate and looked it what difference does it make mordecai yelled at him hes agreed to suffer the indignity of surrendering his license what does an extra six months give you this is absurd the two corporate boys from riveroaks had had enough naturally afraid of courtrooms their fear had reached new heights after three hours of mordecai there was no way on earth they would endure two weeks of trial they shook their heads in frustration and whispered intensely to one another even tillman gantry was tired of arthurs nitpicking with the settlement so close finish the damned thing seconds earlier mordecai had yelled what difference does it make and he was right it really made no difference especially for a street lawyer like me one whose job and salary and status would remain wonderfully unaffected by a temporary suspension i stood and very politely said your honor lets split the difference we offered six months they want twelve ill agree to nine i looked at barry nuzzo when i said this and he actually smiled at me if arthur had opened his mouth at that point he wouldve been mugged everyone relaxed including deorio then we have a deal he said not waiting for a confirmation from the defendants his wonderfully efficient law clerk pecked away at a word processor in front of the bench and within minutes she produced a onepage settlement memorandum we quickly signed it and left there was no champagne at the office sofia was doing what she always did abraham was attending a homeless conference in new york if any law office in america could absorb five hundred thousand dollars in fees without showing it it was the th street legal clinic mordecai wanted new computers and phones and probably a new heating system the bulk of the money would be buried in the bank drawing interest and waiting for the lean times it was a nice cushion one that would guarantee our meager salaries for a few years if he was frustrated by the reality of sending the other five hundred thousand to the cohen trust he concealed it well mordecai was not one to worry about the things he couldnt change his desk was covered with the battles he could win it would take at least nine months of hard labor to sort out the burton settlement and that was where i would spend much of my time heirs had to be determined then found then dealt with when they realized there was money to be had it would get complicated for example the bodies of kito spires and those of temeko alonzo and dante might have to be exhumed for dna tests to establish paternity if he was in fact the father then he would inherit from the children who died first since he was now dead his estate would be opened and his heirs located lontaes mother and brothers posed intimidating problems they still had contacts on the streets they would be paroled in a few years and they would come after their share of the money with a vengeance there were two other projects of particular interest to mordecai the first was a pro bono program the clinic had once organized then allowed to slip away as federal monies evaporated at its peak the program had a hundred lawyers volunteering a few hours a week to help the homeless he asked me to consider reviving it i liked the idea we could reach more people make more contacts within the established bar and broaden our base for raising funds that was the second project sofia and abraham were incapable of effectively asking people for money mordecai could talk people out of their shirts but he hated to beg i was the bright young waspy star who could mix and mingle with all the right professionals and convince them to give annually with a good plan you could raise two hundred thousand bucks a year he said and what would we do with it hire a couple of secretaries a couple of paralegals maybe another lawyer as we sat in the front after sofia left watching it grow dark outside mordecai began dreaming he longed for the days when there were seven lawyers bumping into each other at the clinic every day was chaos but the little street firm was a force it helped thousands of homeless people politicians and bureaucrats listened to the clinic it was a loud voice that was usually heard weve been declining for five years he said and our people are suffering this is our golden moment to turn it around and the challenge belonged to me i was the new blood the new talent who would reinvigorate the clinic and take it to the next level i would brighten up the place with dozens of new volunteers i would build a fundraising machine so that we could lawyer on the same field as anyone we would expand even knock the boards off the windows upstairs and fill the place with talented advocates the rights of the homeless would be protected as long as they could find us and their voices would be heard through ours thirtynine early friday i was sitting at my desk happily going about my business as a lawyersocial worker when drake and sweeney in the person of arthur jacobs suddenly appeared at my door i greeted him pleasantly and cautiously and he sat in one of the maroon chairs he didnt want coffee he just wanted to talk arthur was troubled i was mesmerized as i listened to the old man the last few weeks had been the most difficult of his professional careerall fiftysix years of it the settlement had given him little comfort the firm was back on track after the slight bump in the road but arthur was finding sleep difficult one of his partners had committed a terrible wrong and as a result innocent people had died drake and sweeney would be forever at fault for the deaths of lontae and her four children regardless of how much money it paid into the settlement and arthur doubted if he would ever get over it i was too surprised to say much so i just listened i wished mordecai could hear him arthur was suffering and before long i felt sorry for him he was eighty had been contemplating retirement for a couple of years but wasnt sure what to do now he was tired of chasing money i dont have a lot of years left he admitted i suspected arthur would attend my funeral he was fascinated by our legal clinic and i told him the story of how id stumbled into it how long had it been there he asked how many people worked there what was the source of funding how did we operate it he gave me the opening and i slipped in because i couldnt practice law for the next nine months the clinic had decided that i should implement a new pro bono volunteer program using attorneys from the big firms in town since his firm happened to be the largest i was thinking of starting there the volunteers would work only a few hours a week under my supervision and we could reach thousands of homeless people arthur was aware of such programs vaguely aware he hadnt performed free work in twenty years he admitted sadly it was normally for the younger associates how well i remembered but he liked the idea in fact the longer we discussed it the larger the program grew after a few minutes he was talking openly of requiring all four hundred of his dc lawyers to spend a few hours a week helping the poor it seemed only fitting can you handle four hundred lawyers he asked of course i said without any idea as to how to even begin such a task but my mind was racing ill need some help though i said what kind of help he asked what if drake and sweeney had a fulltime pro bono coordinator within the firm this person would work closely with me on all aspects of homeless law frankly with four hundred volunteers well need someone on your end he pondered this everything was new and everything was sounding good i plowed ahead and i know just the right person i said he doesnt have to be a lawyer a good paralegal can do it who he asked does the name hector palma ring a bell vaguely hes in the chicago office but hes from dc he worked under braden chance and got pinched arthurs eyes narrowed as he struggled to remember i wasnt sure how much he knew but i doubted if he would be dishonest he seemed to be thoroughly enjoying his soulcleansing pinched he asked yeah pinched he lived in bethesda until three weeks ago when he suddenly moved in the middle of the night a quickie transfer to chicago he knew everything about the evictions and i suspect chance wanted to hide him i was careful i was not about to break my confidential agreement with hector i didnt have to arthur as usual was reading between lines hes from dc yes and so is his wife they have four kids im sure hed love to return does he have an interest in helping the homeless he asked why dont you ask him i said ill do that its an excellent idea if arthur wanted hector palma back in dc to harness the firms newly acquired passion for homeless law it would be done within a week the program took shape before our eyes every drake and sweeney lawyer would be required to handle one case each week the younger associates would do the intake under my supervision and once the cases arrived at the firm they would be assigned by hector to the other lawyers some cases would take fifteen minutes i explained to arthur others would take several hours a month no problem he said i almost felt sorry for the politicians and bureaucrats and office workers at the thought of four hundred drake and sweeney lawyers suddenly seized with a fervor to protect the rights of street people arthur stayed almost two hours and apologized when he realized he had taken so much of my time but he was much happier when he left he was going straight to his office with a new purpose a man on a mission i walked him to his car then ran to tell mordecai megans uncle owned a house on the delaware shore near fenwick island on the maryland line she described it as a quaint old house two stories with a large porch that almost touched the ocean three bedrooms a perfect spot for a weekend getaway it was the middle of march still cold and we could sit by the fire and read books she slightly stressed the part about three bedrooms so there would be plenty of space for each of us to have privacy without matters getting complicated she knew i was limping away from my first marriage and after two weeks of cautious flirting we had both come to realize that things would proceed slowly but there was another reason for mentioning the three bedrooms we left washington friday afternoon i drove megan navigated and ruby nibbled on oatmeal cookies in the backseat wildeyed at the prospect of spending a few days outside the city off the streets on the beach clean and sober she had been clean thursday night three nights with us in delaware would make four monday afternoon we would check her into easterwood a small womens detox center off east capitol mordecai had leaned heavily on someone there and ruby would have a small room with a warm bed for at least ninety days before we left the city she had showered at naomis and changed into new clothes megan had searched every inch of her clothing and bag looking for drugs she found nothing it was an invasion of privacy but with addicts the rules are different we found the house at dusk megan used it once or twice a year the key was under the front doormat i was assigned the downstairs bedroom which ruby thought odd the other two bedrooms were upstairs and megan wanted to be near ruby during the night it rained saturday a cold blowing shower that came from the sea i was alone on the front porch rocking gently in a swing under a thick blanket lost in a dream world listening to the waves break below the door closed the screen slammed behind it and megan walked to the swing she lifted the blanket and tucked herself next to me i held her firmly if not she wouldve fallen onto the porch she was easy to hold wheres our client i asked watching tv a strong gust threw mist in our faces and we squeezed tighter the chains holding the swing squeaked louder then faded as we became almost still we watched the clouds swirl above the water time was of no importance what are you thinking she asked softly everything and nothing away from the city i could look back for the first time and try to make sense of it all thirtytwo days earlier i had been married to someone else living in a different apartment working in a different firm a complete stranger to the woman i was now holding how could life change so drastically in a month i didnt dare think of the future the past was still happening
