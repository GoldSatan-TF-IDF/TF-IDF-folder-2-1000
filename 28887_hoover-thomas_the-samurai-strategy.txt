thomas hoover the samurai strategy chapter one new york new york friday early september dusk heading uptown on madison sheets of icy rain washed the pavement heralding the onslaught of autumn and the miserable winter to come the city was poised for its cruelest months that twilight of the spirit when strangers armwrestle for taxis nobody has time to hold a door and you cherish every fleeting human kindness bring on the blizzards the holiday madness this winter i was planning something long overdue to treat my daughter amy the madame curie of her ninth grade to a real vacation just us wed leave at thanksgiving and stay gone through the christmas break she got to live with me three months a year and december was by god going to be one of the months school shed already skipped a year maybe she was a little too fasttrack for thirteen since joanna my ex had already lined up her own holiday excursion amy the spy claimed it was with some divorced tishman vp she hadnt bothered inventing the usual roadblocks clear sailing wed open the house down in st croix and spend a month getting reacquainted work on the tan and some postgraduate snorkeling a strategic move while i still enjoyed a small sliver of her attention before a certain totally terrific skateboard virtuoso finally got around to noticing her only a couple of jobs needed finishing but theyd be wrapped up with weeks to spare that night in truth had its moments of nostalgia the destination was sothebys auction house a place where matthew walton was greeted by name at the cashiers window home away from home for obsessive collectors i leaned back against the vinyl seat of the checker letting the rhythm of the streetlight halos glimmer past and reflected on all those happy nights id made the trek with joanna shed had no real interest in my collecting hobby japanese samurai swords and armor but she was always a decent sport about it besides she had her own passions while i was agonizing over long blades and short blades shed sneak off and browse for something french and nineteenth century and expensive fact is id usually plan ahead and have something of my own on the block just to pay for that little sketch or print she suddenly had to have out of habit id even shipped up a couple of mistakes for the auction this evening a hand axe and a lacqueredmetal face guard though tonights sale had only a few odd items in my specialty the slim offerings actually suited the occasion it left the evening open time for the real agendagetting things rolling with a new client whod inexplicably handed me a job as simple as it was strange the man name of matsuo noda had rung all the way from japan friday before last introduced himself in generalities then declared he had a pressing legal matter requiring both speed and confidentiality inquiries had led him to me would i have time to help him locate an office building to buy he claimed he was head of a kyoto consulting outfit that called itself nippon inc and he was looking for something in midtown seventymillion range honestly i couldnt quite believe he was serious at first why this job just a little legwork really for somebody hed never even met i could swing it sure but now that japanese investors were snapping up us property right and left who needed some extexan turned new york lawyer knocking around there was no rational reason to engage a corporate attorney out of curiosity why arent you working through one of the tokyo firms here in new york say hiro real estate or kg land surely they could mr walton he interrupted smoothly but firmly allow me to say i have my reasons may i remind you i stressed confidentiality merely asking i took a deep breath the connection was distorted a highpitched hum in the background as though he wasnt using commercial phone lines if you want i can look around and see whats on the market and in the meantime how about sending along a prospectus just for the file assuredly he said and i do look forward to working with you after a few more polite nothings he abruptly closed out the call peculiar that wasnt how the japanese road show usually did business from what id seen tokyo invests very cautiously and deliberately sometimes researching a deal half to death i momentarily wondered if it wasnt just one of the jokers from my old partnership pulling my leg he was real enough a brochure arrived by overnight air bound in leather with a flowery covering letter two problems most of the thing was in his native tongue and what i could read didnt tip his hand from the looks of its public disclosures nippon inc was merely some kind of money manager for japanese investment banks it had almost no assets of its own all i could find listed were a few million dollars lunch money for a japanese outfit mostly cash parked in some shortterm euroyen paper that and a head office in kyoto was the sum of it whats more noda only worked with japanese banks and firms no foreign clients so why did this man suddenly require space in new york an entire building i honestly couldnt figure it on the other hand with any luck the whole deal probably could be put together with a few phone calls by way of introduction let me say that i worked technically as a straightforward attorneyatlaw i say technically because i was in fact a freelance defensive back in the corporate takeover game which these days is anything but straight youd have to go back to the roaring twenties to find so many creative screwjobs some people are drawn to power guess im more attracted to the idea of occasionally whittling it down to size so when some hotshot raider found a happy little company whose breakup value was worth more than the current stock price then decided to move in and grab it loot the assets and sell off the piecesone of the players apt to end up downfield was matt walton for reasons that go a long way back i liked to break up the running patterns of the fastbuck artists its a game where you win some and lose some the trick is to try and beat the odds and i suppose id had my share of luck give you a quick example back in the spring a midsize cosmetics outfit called me in as part of their reinforcements to fight an avaricious rape better known as a hostile takeover by one of their biggest competitors after looking over the balance sheet and shares outstanding i suggested they divest a couple of unpromising consumer divisionsnamely a male fragrance line that made you smell like a kid leaving the barbershop and a feminine hygiene product that could have been a patent infringement on lysoland use the proceeds to buy back their own common shares we also threw together a poison pill that would have practically had them owning anybody who acquired more than twenty percent of their stock our move scared hell out of the circling vultures and reinforced my reputation on the street unduly harsh i thought as a givenoquarter son of a bitch another fact worth mentioning is that i worked without benefit of a real office after selling off my piece of the law partnership i operated out of my place downtown with a telephone and a couple of computers a kindly grayhaired dynamo by the name of emma epstein who had a rent controlled apartment down the block dropped by afternoons and handled correspondence filing matrimonial advice and the occasional pot of medicinal chicken soup the only other member of my staff was a shaggy sheepdog named benjamin who served as security chief periodically sweeping the back garden for the neighbors cat that was it oh yes one other item crucial as it turned out id always been a collector of somethingonce it was antique spurs for chrissakebut about ten years earlier id started to get interested in things japanese and ended up going a little overboard about old swords and such joannas unscheduled departure managed to burn out a lot of my circuits and what had been merely an obsession grew into something a little crazy for a year or so i became in my own mind at least a sort of american ronin a wandering samurai you see the japanese warriors had a code that said you ought to live every moment in full awareness of your own mortality when you adopt this existential outlook so they claimed all regrets emotions complaints can be seen as an indulgence youre ready to meet life headon to risk everything at a moments notice thats the only way you ever discover who you really are and its supposed to make you marvelously detached almost enough to make you forget how your ravenhaired brilliant sexy mate packed it in one new years eve twenty months past when you called late from the office again after declaring that that was the goddam last straw and apparently the only thing you could find worthy of undivided attention came printed on goddam computer paper and she was goddam sick of itwhich she demonstrated the next day by slamming the door on her way out add to which she used my momentary disorientation to get custody of amy so while i was battling corporate goliaths i let her walk off with the only thing i would have given my life for the more time went by the more i wanted to kick myself alex katz of walton halliday and katznow minus the walton read the custody agreement the day after i signed it sighed glared over his smudgy halflenses and announced that this kind of unconditional surrender should only be signed on the decks of battleships what did he have a law partner or a fucking schlemiel he was right for all the wrong reasons not long after i cashed in my piece of the firm and went independent win or lose its best to sort things out on your own i was then forty three six one and weighed in at an even one eighty there were a few lines on the face and several more on the psyche but the sandy hair was mostly intact and i could still swim a couple of miles if absolutely essential maybe there was still time for a new start part of that therapy was going to be our trip perhaps i should also add that id had a brief rebound fling for what it was worth the lady was donna austen a name youll recognize as belonging to that irrepressibly cheerful personalities host on what channel eight likes to term its evening news shed called about a segment on the subject of the cosmetics company takeover then very much in the local press and id said fine she ended up downtown and soon thereafter we became an item she was the closest id had to a girlfriend and at that it was mostly an onagain offagain thingwhich terminated in an event reminiscent of the hindenburgs last flight in the aftermath i went back to chatting with amy every day on the phone putting together stock buyback packages and collecting japanese swords anyway while the cab waited for a light wornout wipers squeaking i fumbled around in my coat pocket and extracted the meishi the business card one side in english the other japanese that had been included with nodas letter hed personalized it with a handwritten note on the side with english print now id kept track of the new japanese investment heavies in townnomura daiwa nikko sumitomosince you never know when a corporation might need some fast liquidity they were starting to play hardball and these days with all that cheap money back home they would underbid a ninefigure financing deal before drexel burnham could spell junk bond but nippon inc never heard of the outfit well i thought youll know the story soon enough the driver had just hung a right on fiftyseventh and was headed east toward york avenue id called that afternoon to lower the reserve on one of my lots and had been told that because of some union squabble the preview would continue till just before the sale now scheduled to kick off at eightthirty it wasnt quite seven yet so we would have at least an hour to run through my list of prospective buildings as the cab pulled up next to the chaste glass awning i took a deep breath shoved a ten through the plexiglas panel between the seats and stepped out while the battered checker lamented remnant of a vanishing species squealed into the dark i unbuttoned my overcoat and headed up the steps a few grimfaced patrons milled here and there in the lobby but nobody looked familiar there was even a new girl at the desk by the stairs ash blond and tasteful smoked pearls pure bryn mawr art history a class act sothebys it appeared that most of the japanese crowd was already upstairs undoubtedly meditating on their bids with the meticulous precision of the orient i was headed up the wide granite steps myself when i decided to check out the downstairs one last time hold on could be theres a possibility waiting over by the coat check thumbing the catalog was a distinguishedlooking guy retirement age wearing a light charcoal suit italian unlike the usual japanese businessmen he clearly didnt assume he had to dress like an undertaker and keep a low profile no probably just some mitsubishi board member thinking to diversify his portfolio with a few objets dart abruptly he glanced up smiled and headed my way i realized id been recognized mr walton how good of you to come after a quick bow he produced his card a formality that totally ignored the fact hed already sent me one as convention required i held it in my left hand and studied it anew while i accepted his hearty american handshake its a pleasure to meet you at last at last i let that puzzler pass and handed over a card of my own which he held politely throughout our opening ritual then pocketed noda had a mane of silver hair sculptured around a lean tan face and he looked to be somewhere between sixty and seventy though his dark eyes were caught in a web of wrinkles that bespoke his years they had a sparkle of raw energy he moved with an easy poise and the initial impression was that of a man eminently selfpossessed he had that sturdy nononsense assurance usually reserved for airline pilots if you had to entrust somebody with your wife or your life savings this man would be your pick well my new clients a mover i told myself all the same i accepted his hand with a vague twinge of misgiving what was it maybe something about him was a little too precise too calculated mr walton permit me to introduce my personal consultant he laughed a slight edge beneath the charm and more wrinkles shot outward from the corners of his eyes i always seek her approval of major acquisitions particularly those of the heian period her specialty he turned with what seemed obvious pride and gestured toward the tall japanese woman standing behind him id been so busy sizing him up id completely failed to notice her i must confess she is in fact my niece i suppose that ages me another smile you may possibly be familiar with her professional name so perhaps i should use that may i introduce akira mori who i stared a second before the face clicked into place and the name they both belonged to a wellknown commentator on tokyo television only one slight problem her specialty had nothing to do with art hajimemashite how do you do mr walton she bowed formally and i noticed with all the warmth of an iceberg no surprisei knew her opinion of americans she did not bother meeting my eye she looked just as i remembered her from the tube a knockout her hair was pulled back into a chignon framing that classic oval face and her age was anybodys guess given the ivory skin and granite chin she was wearing a bulky something in black and deep ocher by one of the new tokyo designers for some reason i was drawn to her fingernails long and bronze the parts a mixture of classic and avantgarde did not seem of a piece the kind of detail you didnt notice on the tv but there was something more important than her looks id been to tokyo from time to time for various reasons and id heard a lot of stories about this lady fact is you didnt have to be japanese to know that akira mori was easily japans most listenedto money analyst youve probably seen her yourself in snippets of that weekly chat show she had on nhk which used to get picked up by the networks here when they needed a quick thirty seconds on japan this week or such her ratings had little to do with the fact shes a looker she was talk had it an unofficial source for official government monetary policy akira mori always had a lead on exactly what was afoot from the bank of japan to the ministry of finance even before the prime minister broke the news miss mori whoever the hell she was had some very well placed friends tell you something else she didnt go out of her way to find flattering things to say about how uncle sam handled his bankbook these days her appearance here made nodas unorthodox office plans even more perplexing we both appreciate your taking time from your schedule to meet with us he bowed again weve been looking forward to having you join us at the sale while akira mori appeared to busy herself with a catalog noda and i got things going with that standard formality preceding any serious japanese professional contact meaningless chat its how they set up their ningen kankei their relationship with the other guy and its also the way they finetune their honne their gut feeling about a situation any greenhorn foreigner who skimps on these vital niceties runs the risk of torpedoing his whole deal in response to my pro forma inquiries matsuo noda declared he liked new york had even lived here for a while once honestly found it less hectic than tokyo usually stayed these days at the japanese hotel down on park but sometimes picked the plaza when he needed to be closer to midtown he adored la grenouille and thought la tulipe overpraised when i pressed him he declared his favorite japanese place to dine was nippon over in the east fifties maybe he merely liked the name but it was my pick as well after he had in turn solicited my own views on sothebys a couple of the galleries down madison and various north italian eateries he suggested we go on upstairs and preview the lots all the while miss mori appeared to ignore us standing there like a statue of some shinto goddess except for the occasional tug at her dark hair maybe she didnt give a damn about this obligatory small talk thought it was oldfashioned or possibly she liked the idea of being the only one not to show a hand and as noda led the way up toward the exhibition rooms she trailed behind like a dutiful japanese womanwhile we naturally continued to talk of everything except god forbid why we were there in the first room we were suddenly in my arenasamurai swords and battle gear this is your special interest is it not mr walton noda smiled then turned to admire the row of shining steel tachi threefootlong razors now being watched over by a trio of nervous guards sothebys didnt need some amateur toshiro mifune accidentally carving up the clientele i understand you have a notable collection yourself what what else did he know about me easy walton play the game i knew what a japanese would expect in reply matter of fact ive lucked onto a couple of items over the years then the standard disclaimers my own painstaking collection was merely a grab bag of knickknacks the fumbling mistakes of a dabbler etc etc noda monitored this culturally correct blarney with satisfaction as it happens mr walton i was in nagoya last year when several of your pieces were on loan for the show at the tokugawa museum i still recall certain ones particularly that fine fifteenthcentury katana attributed to the mizuno clan unusual steel no date or mark of the swordsmith but a remarkable piece all the same a splitsecond pause your reluctance to part with it was most understandable this man had done his homework or maybe hed been the one who had tried to buy it the steel was unusual too heavy on copper id even had a little metallurgical testing done on it down at princeton just to prove that hunch but it was no big deal merely an oddity that had fallen my way via an estate sale there was an anonymous inquiry shortly after the exhibition opened with an insistent offer but id turned it down poker time i was honored your figure was more than generous he laughedbullseye i watched as he glanced back at miss mori maybe a bit nervously then he returned his attention merely a small gesture for the museum i felt it should be back in japanese hands he continued his voice now sober you do understand certainly i just stared good i see i was right he had paused to examine a large monochrome screen it was eighteenth century and he inspected it with only mild interest then moved on i was still knocked over could that be why hed retained me as his us legal counsel because of some damned antique sword okay i was already getting the idea matsuo noda might be a trifle eccentric but all the same interesting he was pointing at a long picture part of a series locked in a wide glass case honto ni omoshiroi desu ne miss mori was already there in a voice scarcely above a whisper she proceeded to give him a rundown of pros and cons it was the first time id noticed any enthusiasm out of the woman all night i checked my catalogue the piece was a heian hand scroll said to be exceedingly rare after a few moments noda motioned me over perhaps you could give us your opinion what do you think he pointed down the subject is intriguing these are ladiesinwaiting for the emperor fujiwara notice the delicate refinement of the coloring the matched fabrics each enhancing the other like flowers in a bouquet that was eight centuries ago just before the rise of the first shogun the first generalissimo who would rule in the emperors name when he said shogun niece mori shot him a quick admonitory glance there was some kind of unmistakable electricity passing something left unspoken the heian era ended with the great conflict between the heike and genji clans that led to the death of the ruling emperor in and the loss of the imperial sword at sea next he said something in guttural japanese to mori obviously very intent and indicated one corner of the painting where the emperor sat her reply was quick and curt now i only know a little of the language maybe a couple of cuts above berlitz level but i did manage to pick up she wasnt talking about the painting something to do with the emperor himself though i missed the rapidfire delivery in response to nodas question i tried to sound intelligent saying the ink coloring looked well preserved or some such auction house mumbo jumbo it wasnt my thing really which the man surely knew he seemed to know everything else about me after he listened politely they switched back to japanese and finally settled on a bid i watched as she marked it in the cataloguelow six figures walton i thought youre dealing with a pair of heavyweights by then id decided not to bother bidding on anything there were too many curious twists not to mention the building deal surely the ritual had gone far enough the samurai negotiating ploy of making your adversary be first to reveal his game plan why not bring up why we were there just for the hell of it when i did noda betrayed a fleeting smile but of course the building he made it sound like some kind of trivial annoyance a nuisance to get out of the way so we could all get back to the serious work of admiring the pretty pictures touche i thought round one to noda on points i assume youve had a look at the package of materials i messengered up to your hotel yesterday a broker friend had put together some listings for office buildings around midtownit turned out the market was softening a touch due to the latest construction bingeand id hoped that maybe something would catch nodas eye matter of fact there were a couple of real bargains over near sixth my people have examined it in detail we would like to move forward on the twentystory building on third avenue for a second i thought he was joking sure wed tossed in the writeup because it fit his profile but it was a crazy all cash deal and they wanted ninety million firm did you read the terms on that one its all there is a vacant floor is there not available immediately well yes but there may be a few items to clarifywe would like your legal opinion concerning the leases of the existing tenantsbut nothing major if the seller is prepared i think we could even go to contract early next week while im here i would like very much to close as soon as possible if some of my staff can meet with the sellers attorneys over the weekend perhaps we can start work over the weekend no counter bid no haggling now you didnt have to be a brain surgeon to realize this was a fasttrack deal matsuo noda was a man in a hurry looks like you just may have yourself a piece of property ill try and get hold of them in the morning if i can and start the ball rolling excellent he hesitated a moment as though framing his words then continued but in fact mr walton wed actually wanted to meet you tonight for an entirely different purpose id hoped we might be working together on well some additional matters something else as you might surmise we are not enlarging our presence here to no purpose tonight i wanted to tell you something about the objectives of nippon inc and then let you decide if what we propose merits your participation your financial expertise could make you a great asset to us hang on i thought this thing is starting to go a little fast what do you have in mind first let me say you are a man i have long admired your style is not unlike my own we both understand the importance of moving cautiously of keeping our adversaries off guard most of all there is a rigorous discipline about your work that is the style of bushido the way of the warrior he smiled and his tone lightened i think we could cooperate very effectively already i was wondering whether i really wanted to cooperate any further with matsuo noda something about the man and miss mori made me very nervous besides i was trying to finish off work now not begin more but hed found out the one line that would keep me listening hed somehow discovered i was a deep admirer of the oldtime military strategists of the eastsuch as sun tzu and miyamoto musashi like a hostile takeover bid the ancient japanese way of combat was ritualized as mounted warriors rode out announced their lineage to the sec then matched up with men of equal renown the samurai prized flexibility over brute strength they had steel swords that handled like scalpels and body armor that was a woven mesh of lacquerediron scales laced together in rows to create a fabric of metal those weapons and armor made for agile movement easy feints fast changes in strategyall trademarks of mine on the corporate takeover battlefield as a result i fancied myself some kind of samurai too the question was how did noda know this for some reason just then i glanced over toward akira mori she appeared to be studying a scroll with the detachment of a zen monk in zazen meditation but she wasnt missing a syllable care to run through whatever it is you have in mind i indicated one of the ottomans along the side of the room now clearing as bidders rose to go inside i watched as the dark suited japanese businessmen filed past none with nodas sense of style and noticed that several seemed acquainted with him pausing to offer obsequious bows with pleasure he settled himself mori now looking over some screens still didnt elect to join us first may i presume you already know something of nippon inc no more than what i gleaned from that package you forwarded almost nothing really he laughed a flash of even teeth perhaps i should be pleased these days too much visibility in the us can sometimes stir up friction your prospectus indicated you help banks manage capital so i assume youre looking to enter the financial picture here that was the funny part recall there was no indication of any us action in his prospectus yet i knew that overall japans us investment private and public was in the tens and hundreds of billions pension funds and industries were building factories financing corporations snapping up treasury paper japan had become a major source of fresh money for the us and for the world but nippon inc wasnt one of the players yes we intend to be concerned initially with the position of japanese capital in the us we are particularly interested in the matter of treasury debentures that was what anybody would have figured just that week the journal had noted that japanese investors were expected to cover half of our treasury overdrafts for the year they were advancing us the bucks to keep up that spending spree known as the national deficit they sold us toyotas we sold them federal ious using the proceeds to buy more toyotas in effect they were financing the good life supplying us the revolving credit to buy their cars and dvds and semiconductors treasuries always make a lot of sense i picked up the thread full faith and credit of the us government all the rest quite so mr walton but since all things are theoretically possible over the past few months ive undertaken a small program through subsidiaries of nippon inc to begin cushioning japans exposure in your treasury market somewhat he paused now that my effort may be expanding significantly i was wondering if perhaps you might consent to serve as our american agent in that endeavor for a second i didnt grasp what he was driving at probably because my involvement seemed totally unnecessary surely he realized treasuries were bought and sold here every day on the open market through dealer banks no big deal why bother hiring a middleman i can make this quick why dont you just contact some of the authorized japanese brokers here in new york you must have used them before nomura securities is well respected theres also nikko securities and daiwa securities america theyre all primary dealers in treasury paper now buy or sell whatever you like noda nodded of course but we both know the financial markets can be very delicate impressions count for much which is why i have chosen to keep a low profile consequently i would prefer to continue to operate for a time outside normal channels and in that regard i now believe it would be desirable to have an experienced american financial specialist assist us you in particular would be ideal i studied him let me make sure i understand this youre asking me to step in and begin fronting for you here in the treasury market that is correct mr walton he rose and strolled over to the row of tachi swords where miss mori was still standing they were lying on a spread of dark velvet and she was scrutinizing them with a connoisseurs eye now id like to think i was a quick study of a situation but this one was definitely out of whack somehow if all noda wanted was to roll over a little government paper why the hushhush more to the point why a whole building in midtown he could easily do it from tokyo the scenario didnt compute before this conversation goes any further id like a better idea of the kind of activity youre talking about selling treasuries moving the funds into corporate bonds or munis commercial paper equities sell he abruptly paused to watch as the staff began carefully assembling the weapons to take inside for the sale and his mind seemed to wander you know mr walton the sword always has held the greatest fascination for me to make one of these layers of steel of different hardnesses were hammered together like a sandwich then reheated hammered out folded again and again until there were perhaps a million paperthin layers he pointed to one of the long blades now glistening in the light you cannot see it of course but they used a laminate of soft steel for the core harder grades for the cutting edge and whereas the edge was tempered quickly to preserve its sharpness the core was made to cool very slowly leaving it pliant he suddenly smiled with what seemed embarrassment and turned back i take great inspiration from the sword mr walton the man holding one must learn to meld with the spirit in the steel he must become like it what better than to meet the world with your hardest surface yet maintain an inner flexibility able to bend to circumstance as the need may arise he stood a moment as though lost in some reverie then chuckled sometimes i do tend to go on and on i believe it was selling you asked about the fact is you would not be actually selling treasury obligations then what are you familiar with interestrate futures of course the question was so unexpected i answered almost before i thought futures contracts were part of the big new game on wall street although most of the action was still out in chicago places like the merc and the board of trade left over from the old days when farmers sold their crops in advance at an agreedupon price the farmer sold his grain harvest to a speculator while it was still nothing but green sprouts he was worried the price might drop before he got it to market the speculator was praying it would head up the farmer interestingly was selling something he didnt yet have but even if the price of wheat suddenly tanked he was covered these days futures contracts were traded for all kinds of things whose value might change with time high on that list were financial instruments such as treasury notes and bonds whose resale worth could drop if interest rates unexpectedly rose if you owned a bond and were worried it might go down in value you could hedge your exposure with a futures contract in effect selling it in advance at the current price and letting somebody else assume the risk of future market uncertainty modern finance being the marvel it is you could even sell bonds you didnt own just like the farmers nonexistent grain the wall street crowd called this a naked contract since you were obligated to go out and acquire that bond in the open market on the day youd agreed to deliver it even if the price had skyrocketed in the meantime or you had to try and buy back the contract of course you were betting that price would go down letting you pocket the difference pious spirits on the futures exchanges called these deals high finance and risk hedging they operated however remarkably like legalized gambling dabbling in interestrate futures was not for those with a dicey heart our objective noda went on is to cushion japans exposure somewhat with futures contracts precisely us treasury obligations are held by a variety of investors in japan but up until now we have made very little use of the protection possible in your futures markets nippon inc will concern itself with that i listened thoughtfully so youre saying you want to create an insurance program for japanese investors in case the price of treasuries weakens it made sense if interest rates went up here reducing the value of their government paper then the price of his futures contracts would rise to offset the loss i glanced over at japans monetary guru akira mori who was carefully examining her bronze fingernails was she the one behind all this sudden nervousness about americas financial health what could these two know that we didnt i wondered it was all a bit mysterious one thing was no mystery though whatever was going on with matsuo noda and akira mori gave me a very unsettled feeling im flattered i looked him over but afraid ill have to pass this fall i plan to take off for a while and catch up on some personal matters that mr walton he cut in i would urge you not to lightly dismiss my proposal he was staring back at me intensely i can only say for now that issues are involved well they encompass matters of grave international consequence another pause followed by a noticeable hardening of tone your other obligations cannot possibly be as important it would be in your best interest to hear me out want the truth at that moment all my negative vibes about matsuo noda crystallized he wasnt threatening me exactly or maybe he was the large viewing room was all but empty now maybe hed deliberately waited before getting down to his real agenda my other obligations happen to be very important to me just now then please consider rearranging them besides my fees can be substantial they werent all that substantial but i was looking to slow him down your fees do not present a problem he continued this afternoon a retainer of one hundred thousand dollars was deposited in your personal account at chase what in hell money is of no consequence in this matter mr walton time is you seem awfully sure ill agree we expect your involvement to begin immediately i cannot stress too strongly the urgency of what you will undertake he smiled thinly i also feel confident a man who enjoys a challenge as much as you do will find our undertaking intellectually rewarding seems i was hired and i hadnt even said yes this guy had another think coming besides he could get anybody to do what he wanted he didnt need me as i stood there i started trying to guess the dimensions of matsuo nodas financial hedge taken all together japan probably had roughly a hundred billion and change tied up in us government paper no way could he be thinking of covering more than a fraction of that i knew plenty of law clerks who could do it for godsake a few phone calls to a couple of floor traders in chicago look the most i can do for you is recommend some very competent brokers i know to help you out there shouldnt be too much to it youll just have to go easy you cant hit the market makers in chicago with too much action all at once prices get out of kilter then too there are exchange limits that is why we will be trading worldwide noda withdrew a folded sheet of paper from his breast pocket perhaps youd like to glance over our program these are cumulative totals which include our activity to date but we will begin moving much more rapidly as soon as ive completed all the financial arrangements with our institutional managers at home perhaps you will see why we need a monetary professional i was still chewing on the financial arrangements part as i took the paper opened it and scanned the schedule of contracts while i stood there the room around us sort of blurred out i had to sit down again all his talk about samurai and nerves of steel was for real matsuo noda had a program underway to sell futures on a pile of us treasury bills notes and bonds he didnt own naked in an amount i had trouble grasping i knew one thing though if interest rates headed down raising the value of those presold obligations hed be forced to cover awesome losses hed be in a financial pickle that would make brazil look flush on the other hand if some disaster occurred and us interest rates suddenly shot sky high numbers the cbots longinterest contracts notes and bonds are in denominations of a hundred thousand each the mercs short paper bills and cds are in units of a million per finally i did some quick arithmetic and toted up the zeros something had to be wrong here nobody had balls that big i decided to run through the figures again just to be sure it was along about then that i realized all nodas pious talk about sheltering japanese widows and orphans had been purest bullshit resting there in my hand was the biggest wager slip in world history assuming enough players could be found worldwide to take his action he was planning to advancesell us treasury ious in the amount of five hundred billion dollars a full quarter of our national debt his bet something or somebody was about to push america over the brink chapter two yo counselor get thy butt over here and buy me a drink i was standing in the smoky entry of martells on the way back downtown from sothebys when i heard the voice a georgia drawl known from wall street to washington and sure enough leaning against the long mahogany bar the usual glenfiddich on the rocks in hand was none other than bill henderson long time no see id actually stopped by for a little ninety proof nerve medicine myself not to pass the time with americas foremost cowboy marketplayer but the idea of bringing in a wall street pro was most welcome if anybody could dissect nodas game bill was the man what was i going to do id stalled on giving matsuo noda a final answer telling him i needed time to think then just to make sure the whole thing hadnt been some sort of macabre hoax id checked at a chase bank machine on lex he hadnt been kidding a retainer had been deposited all right presumably by certified check since it had already cleared i was on the payroll ready or not noda was right about one thing what he planned to do had grave international consequences the problem was his game had just one payoff the way i figured it he won if and only if the us suddenly went broke as international consequences go that seemed reasonably grave henderson was the perfect guru to take apart the scenario assuming he was sober tell the truth at first glance i wasnt entirely sure the guy looked a mess i assumed he was holding some sort of private celebration or maybe it was a wake what was the occasion william h welcome back to town thought youd decamped permanently down to dc packed it in back to start making a living again could be ive just set some kind of new world record for the briefest tenure ever seen on the council he eased over to make room while the jukebox began some bobby short standard about incomparable ny so wheres your tv star tonight sure love that gal he toasted donnas memory if tits were brains shed be a genius sexist tasteless that was merely henderson warming up i hadnt actually set eyes on bill since an illfated birthday dinner donna had thrown for him in midsummer a favor to a producer friend of hers at the station whod wanted to try vamping a real live millionaire that evening hed arrived with a serious head start on the whiskey his meditation on the concept of birthdays and then proceeded to regale those assembled with his encyclopedic repertoire of farmersdaughter and travelingsalesman vignettes in the aftermath donna swore shed kill him if he ever set foot in her place again when i made the mistake of speaking in his defense she critiqued a few of my character defects as well then added me to the list friend no small thanks to you and that sordid evening i havent seen donna since that was a dark moment in my history after listening half the night to that airhead producer she put next to me i was in mourning for the hearts and minds of america he revolved back to the bar whatre you drinking something serious i pointed toward the single malt laphroaig neat just then bill paused to watch as two women in bulky raincoats brushed past they receded toward the other end of the bar settled their coats across an empty stool and ordered drinks one was a youngish blonde a bit nervous having some tall colored potion that looked as if it could use a cut of pineapple and a plastic monkey on the glass but the other one brunette was a different story pained eyes with a psychic armor that could only be called battleweary new york joanna all over again tanqueray martini straight up hot damn sure is good to be back in this town he was trying without conspicuous success to catch the younger womans eye henderson youre standing next to a man with some news that could well alarm you considerably like maybe this dump might run low on booze not likely i reached for my new drink ive got to make a decision fast so try to keep a clear head and see if you can help me out in my estimation henderson was a phenomenonsober or loaded hed emerged from the red clay hills somewhere in north georgia former football allstate i only did it for the pussy and ended up at yale lawwhere we shared an apartment for three whole years by the time wed finished our degrees i figured i was ready to tackle real life but bill had hung in and gone for a phd in economics although his athletes physique hadnt survived yalean early casualty of the single malt and the dunhillshenderson still had the delusion he was twentyfive easter before last hed arrived at my place down in the islands with some leggy print model half his age and a case of jack daniels black did the redneck routine bamboozle the cautious hearts of his admiring ladies probably right under the radar all that notwithstanding it was a commonly accepted fact that bill was the sharpest private currencytrader on the east coast if tomorrow the dollar was about to dive the guy whod already sold it short tonight from hong kong to zurich was invariably henderson that part of his life had been all over the papers the previous spring after he got tapped for the presidents council of economic advisers i guess some genius on the white house staffurged on by that wily senator from new york our mutual friend jack odonnellconcluded the council needed a pet contrarian on board for appearances and henderson looked to be a sufficiently probusiness prospect wrong after a couple of interviews he was forbidden to make any more public statements hed failed to grasp that the national interest required fantasy forecasts just before elections bill may have been a master of subtlety when he was trading but otherwise he tended to call a spade a spade or worse whats up he was about to punt with the blonde after one last try maybe youd better go first i took a sip savoring the peaty aroma let henderson decompress in his own good time then sound him out on nodas chilling proposition what are you doing here call it modesty and discretion he turned back these were not as you might infer the first descriptors that leapt to mind whenever i thought of bill care to expand he slid his hand across the bar extracted another dunhill from its red pack and launched a disjointed monologue starting with the goddam traffic in dc then proceeding to ditto coming in from laguardia all this time his cigarette had been poised in readiness finally he flicked a sterling silver lighter the oldfashioned kind and watched the orange flame glisten off the mirror at our right so old buddy thats it all the news thats fit to print history will record this as the moment yours truly bailed out i figure it like this if i cant read the signals myself these days what in hell am i doing giving advice time to hit the silk get back to making a living dont know how long this circus is going to last but i figure wed all better be saddled up and ready to ride just in case as it happens selfproclaimed ignorance was a crucial ingredient in hendersons deliberate country boy camouflage designed to disarm the city slickers i estimated the professional dirt farmer next to me armani doublebreasted and gold piaget timepiece was now worth about forty million including a chunk of an offshore bank yet for it all he still liked to come across as though hed just moseyed in and wished somebody would help him through all this fine print dont bullshit me bill i toyed with my drink what youre really saying is you couldnt get anybody else to agree with you have to admit there were a few trifling differences of opinion about the direction things are headed he positioned his dunhill in the ashtray and washed his throat with more scotch you cant cover up the fundamentals with cosmetics things like a megabillion trade shortfall a debt nobody can even count and a dollar that dont know whether to fish or cut bait worst of all were still selling the suckers of the world more funnycolored paper than czarist russia did there aint no quick fix for this one he took another sip then turned back but fuck it remember that old saying i used to have about being a lover not a fighter i always know when its time to call in the huntin dogs and piss on the fire im back in town to stay i got hold of my boys and theyre coming in tomorrow to start getting everything out of mothballs were going back online as anybody who knew bill was aware hed installed a massive computer bank in the converted maids quarters of his fifth avenue apartment hooked to the major futures exchanges and financial markets around the world running his operation on a momenttomoment basis were a couple of young fireballs his georgia mafia who did nothing but watch green numbers blink on a crt screen and buy and sell all day he and his boys talked a language that had very little to do with englishjargon about comparing the implied volatility of options on this currency against the theoretical volatility for that one etc on any given day they were placing straddles on yen options butterfly spreads on pound sterling futures reverse option hedges on deutsche marks and on and on half the time einstein couldnt have tracked what they were doing add to that they leveraged the whole thing with breathtaking margins to stay alive in hendersons game you had to be part oracle part jimmy the greek you also had to have ice water in your veins it wasnt money to him it was a video game where the points just happened to have dollar signs in front the day i dropped in to watch he was down two million by lunch after which we casually strolled over to some shitkicker place on third avenue for barbecued ribs and a beer came back at three and by happyhour time he was ahead half a million in the trade henderson was part of the breed known as a shooter up a million here down a million therejust your typical day in the salt mines a week of that and id have had an ulcer the size of the san andreas fault he liked to characterize his little trading operation as a sideline to cover the rent i happened to know what it really paid was the incidental costs of a lot of expensive ladies could be bills entertainment fund was in need of a transfusion back to business i asked like the good old days bright and early monday morning got a strong hunch the ruskiesll be in the market buying dollars to cover their september shorts on australian wheat futures might as well bid up the greenback and make the comrades work for their daily bread then round about eleven i figure to unwind that and go long sterling just before london central figures out whats happening shits a brick and has to hit the market for a few hundred million pounds to steady the boat well i thought henderson the fearless hasnt lost his touch bill i want to run a small scenario by you i sipped at my drink say somebodyd just told you he was taking a massive position in interestrate futures what would that suggest tells me the mans getting nervous if he was holding a lot of treasury paper for instance hed probably figured rates were about to head up and he didnt want to get creamed see if youre holding a bond that pays say eight percent and all of a sudden interest rates scoot up to ten the resale value of that instrument is gonna go down the sewer but if youve already sold it using a futures contract whoever bought that contract is the one whos got to eat the loss youre covered im not talking about standard hedging i was wondering how to approach the specifics say somebody started selling a load of bond futures naked nothing underlying well thing about that is the mand be taking one hell of a risk he swirled the cubes in his glass anybody does thats bettin big on something we dont even want to think about some kind of panic thatd cause folks to start dumping american debt paper i just stood there in silence examining my glass that was precisely my reading of matsuo nodas move but i cant think of any reason why anything like thats in the cards can you you tell me its hard to imagine the economys like a supertanker takes it a long time to turn around but if you want a special henderson shithitsthefan scenario then i can give it a shot say for instance some monday morning a bunch of those hardworking folks around the world whove been emptying their piggy banks to finance our deficit suddenly up and decided theyd like their money shipped back home thatd create whats known as a liquidity crisis which is a fancy way of saying you dont have enough loose quarters in the cookie jar that morning to pay the milkman and the paperboy both the federal reserve would have to jack up interest rates fast to attract some cash else roll the printing presses or of coursehe grinnedwe could just default declare bankruptcy and tell the world to go fuck itself nobody would possibly let it go that far right i toyed with my scotch particularly japan we owe them more money than anybody wouldnt look for it to happen remember though right now the us treasurys out there with a tin cup begging the money to cover its interest payments if the national debt was on mastercharge theyd take back our card so let some of those japanese pension funds whore shoveling in money start getting edgy or the dollar all of a sudden look weak and you could have a run on the greenback thatd make the bank lines in look like christmas club week thats thinking the unthinkable damned well better be but dont ever forget paper money is an act of faith and were in uncharted territory here never before has the worlds reserve currency the one everybody uses to buy oil and grain and what have you belonged to its biggest debtor nation were bankers for the world and were ass over elbow in hock everybody starts gettin nervous the same day and the bankers on this planet could be back to swapping shells and colored beads offhand id say thats pretty implausible and i agree the system got a pretty good shakeout in the october massacre of and things held together if just barely stocks crashed but the dollar and the debt markets weathered the storm nobody dumped japan doesnt want its prime customer to go belly up who else is gonna buy all that shiny crap i studied my glass again if henderson who had pulse feelers around the globe wasnt worried then maybe matsuo noda was just a nervous spacedout old guy a loonytune with an itch to gamble funny though he appeared the very essence of a coolheaded banker about then the two women across the bar waved for their check and began rummaging their purses sadly enough the brunette had done everything but send over an engraved invitation for us to join them she and i had looked each other over and we both knew what we saw the walking wounded it made me pensive more and more lately id begun to wonder about the roads not taken the options that never were what if all our lives had started out differently where would you be where would i beplaying lawyer now or maybe driving a cab it was the kind of woolgathering that drove donna austen insane it was on my mind that first afternoon i met her when she brought her sound guy down to record some voiceovers to use with shots of the house she made the mistake of asking for a little background so i decided to go way back and give her the big picture it turned out to be a little kinky for the six oclock news i suited the tale by telling her about my father once a rig foreman in the oil patch out around midland texas i was still a kid when he started tinkering around weekends with drill bits out in his shop and i was no more than about ten when he came up with a new kind of tip turned out it could double the life expectancy of a bit not to mention the life expectancy of a lot of roughnecks who had to change them every few hours he patented the thing and next thing you knew he was president of permian basin petroleum your father was a successful inventor shed set her tab down on the living room table and perked up here was some color for her profile more than that the man was a believing capitalist was she really going to understand the significance of what happened you see since no banker would risk loaning out venture capital back in those days he had to take pbp public he needed money so badly he sold off sixty percent of the company like those entrepreneurs who created home computers in their garage she brushed at her carefully groomed auburn hair maybe here was her hook the grabber close he took the money several million and started production and guess what the bit hed invented was too good next thing you know another outfit that will remain nameless here came along and infringed on the patent saying sue uswhich he began trying to do but since they were already tooled up to manufacture they undercut his prices and drove pbps stock down to zip then came the kill they staged a hostile takeover andsince pbp now owned the patents not himaxed the lawsuit bye bye company how does this story relate to what you do today she was checking her watch no longer overly engaged well by the time all this happened i was off studying engineering at the university of texas but when i graduated i decided to do something else i headed for yale law if you cant lick em join em something like that mr walton not exactly ms austen i wanted to find out if the bibles right that guys who live by the sword better be ready to die by the sword after the sheepskin i shopped around and found the manhattan law firm that handled the biggest oilfieldservice outfit in the country then applied to that firms corporate department a couple of years and a lot of memos later our oilfield client somehow got the idea they ought to go vertical acquire their own source of equipment next i ran some numbers and showed them how profitable it would be to acquire a certain tool company that now owned the patent on a terrific drill bit of course it would require a hostile buyout but with a little restructuring they could swing it financially and i worked nights and weekends for six months and personally devised the takeover by oddest coincidence when we were through we decided to strip all that companys overpaid executives of their golden parachutes and dump them on the street my graduation present to the old man she rolled her eyes and waved at her sound man to shut off the mike mr walton i think our viewers would be more interested in personal stories what did she want i wondered this was the most personal story i had what do you mean what i eat for breakfast i do personalities she looked around the living room are you married i was on came the tape but she didnt get what she wanted joanna wouldnt appreciate being critiqued on channel eights evening news and amy would have killed me so i just plunged ahead and finished off the other saga theres a bit more to this intimate bio guess id seen enough quick money in the oil business that id forgotten you were supposed to be impressed by it or maybe id just never mastered the art of kissing my elders asses convincingly youll find ms austen that those are two attitudes whose rewards are largely intangible wall street compatibility definitely not being on the list after five years the management committee offered a partnership but by then id decided to go out and try making it on my own be my own man she waved the sound man off again you mean you quit couldnt have said it better i hung up a shingle and started playing the other side of the scrimmage line i understand youve been in quite a few takeover fights lets say ive fought a lot of takeovers ms austen theres a subtle but important distinction donna austen turned out to be more interested in my marital status than in anecdotes about corporate mayhem thing was beneath all that glitz i found her a challenging woman amy on the other hand despised her but then she never likes anybody i bring home the real problem however was that i kept thinking more about joanna than i did about donna as witness this evening when that sadderbutwiser brunette headed out the door reminded me of her more than a little hate to see that young specimen depart without a goodfaith offer of condolence henderson was wistfully eyeing the young blonde definitely his type trouble is i couldnt locate the equipment tonight with a compass and a search warrant he hoisted his glass then turned back and reached for another dunhill so tell me what brings you uptown never knew you to venture this far into civilization just to stand a drink for your oldest and wisest confidant back to reality william h you will undoubtedly find this difficult to accept but i just got asked to front some treasury action for a new client selling futures where do you find your suckers he grinned thats never been your game hey at least i know the rules corporations have been known to hedge their debt offerings my friend but what ive done up to nows been strictly bush league compared to this so whats the play a foreign outfit that wants low profile and ps theyre talking substantial numbers what do you mean substantial suddenly hendersons input file was on red alert probably wouldnt impress a high roller like you bill i paused half a trillion dollars jeezus he went pale whos putting up the earnest money for this shot let interest rates head the wrong way you couldnt cover the margin calls on a position that size with the gnp of south america what if it happened to be some of our friends from across the pacific an outfit that calls itself nippon inc i looked at him ever hear of it nope he just stood there examining his drink as though it suddenly had acquired an enormous insect but youve got a surefire knack for really messin up an evening i guess this is whats meant when people talk about the big time christ almighty tell you one thing thats a hell of a number to put on the table id sure like to see those boys hand maybe somebodys paying to see ours i finished off my drink and signaled for another the more i thought about matsuo noda the more i realized i needed it you know this half scares the crap out of me matt old buddy do yourself a favor stand clear just back away he was getting more sober by the second youd be lifting up some kind of big rock when you dont know whats under it i never do that ironclad rule same as i always cut losses at ten percent and never let a long position ride over a weekend and ill tell you something else nobody lays down a bet like that unless he knows the casinos fixed he paused i wonder if maybe we oughtnt to give jack a call odonnell lowkey just touch base inside word is his finance committees going to be holding hearings on foreign investment maybe in a couple of months besides i know for a fact he owes you a few that was true senator jack odonnell was headed for reelection headaches he was americas corporate nightmare a former professor of labor law at columbia whod gone out and bought some tailored suits shed thirty pounds dyed his hair and actually gotten elected to the us senate he was despised on wall street for good reason odonnell was the grand inquisitor of the corporate scene hauling ceos in front of his committee every time he sniffed some new scam to shortchange stockholders since we saw eye to eye a lot id made it a point to lean on a few of my clients and come up with some campaign bucks for him telling them it was good insurance money still if i leaked this to jack id probably be reading it tomorrow in the washington post henderson i cant bring him in nobodys talking anything illegal still im beginning to think i ought to keep an eye on this from the inside matt you havent been listening let me pass along a major working principle on how to keep your ass intact in this world write it down and tape it to your phone staying on the sidelines is a position too that applies to wall street and it damned sure applies to life he stretched for a dunhill then leaned back ever tell you about that feisty coon hound i used to have redtick i called by the name of red only about a hundred times red was his favorite sermon text well ol red somehow conceived the idea he was just about the meanest fucker in the county and he was always out to prove it then one night he made the mistake of treeing a big old mama coon up in this little sycamore we had down by the creek i heard him barking and raising hell and i knew i wouldnt get a wink if i didnt go down and see about it henderson christ ive already heard this well im gonna finish it anyhow by god sounds like you could use a refresher course he took a drink now then after i made it through the copperheads and briers and got down there naturally the first thing i did was shine that tree with my light and count the eyes turns out that mama raccoon had a bunch of her little ones up there too so she was in a real disagreeable frame of mind her eyes were bright red and i could tell she was thinking she just might eat herself a smartass hound for supper i tried to explain this to red call him off and get him to come on back up the house but no sirree nothing would do but he had to take her on so i figured it was time he had a little reality contact i chunked a couple of rocks got lucky and down she tumbled next thing ol red knew he thought he had his ass caught in a brandnew john deere hay baler i finally had to kick her off him and get her back up the tree before she really got mad henderson i hear you listen up friend theres a moral you see ol red didnt have enough expertise that night to know when to stand off but ill tell you one thing he learned real fast next time he chased that particular mama up that sycamore he took one sniff and just trotted right on back to the house he sipped again every time i come across a tree full of something i dont know about i remember old red and just turn around and walk away im taking your warning under advisement i threw down a fifty glanced at the soundless mets game on the tv over the bar and reached for my coat youd damned well better henderson get some sleep as a friend and colleague i must in all honesty advise you you look like absolute hell ive always valued your candor he waved for another drink but ive got some heavy thinking to do okay get home safe lets keep in touch he saluted with his glass tell you what matt maybe ill just do a little sniffing around myself see if i cant get a fix on whats up the tree okay i was putting on my coat checking through the window to see if the rain had stopped looked like it had lets both sleep on it you do that he wasnt smiling as i headed out the door henderson who could slumber like a baby when he was down a million for the day didnt look like he had much rest ahead that night for all my brave talk i didnt either now that the rain was over i wandered over to fifth to look at the trees sparkling in the streetlights and to think if youre from west texas you love to see green things wet then i hailed a cab downtown still with lots of unanswered questions on the subject of matsuo noda what had happened to my country that could make it so vulnerable to the financial shenanigans of a single whitehaired foreign banker was this what people meant when they talked about the tides of history was the free ride over back when i was a kid id accepted as an article of faith that america was the greatest that we were destined to lead the world forever was that hubris now i had this sinking feeling we were about to begin learning a little modesty maybe amy didnt know it yet but her america was going to end up being a lot different from mine all of a sudden folks all over the world were about to be richer than we were it was going to take some painful adjustment thats when i finally decided yes by god i would track this one and when i figured out what noda had up his sleeve id blow the whistle somebody needed to stand guard over this country and if not me who matt walton vs matsuo noda as it turned out the evening still wasnt over things continued to go off track beginning with when i walked in my front door i guess by now everybodys pretty blase about urban crime but its still always a shock when it happens to you i also think its getting worse i can remember five years ago when joanna and i never bothered even to latch the street windows these days they have barsa small precaution following an evening on the town during which everything we owned with an electric cord attached walked out into the bracing manhattan night that was my first experience with the hollow feeling in your gut when you realize your sanctum has been plundered its not the lost toys its the violation that gnaws at your karma this time though it appeared to be minor no forcible entry somebody had actually picked the frontdoor lock a fact i only established to my satisfaction after every other possibility had been considered and dismissed truthfully i probably wouldnt have noticed anything at all that night if not for a wayward train of thought on the way home id been meditating on a particular sword in my collection a katana which was totally without distinction except for a little oral history reportedly the blade once tasted blood in a rather arcane episode noda probably would have approved the story was the samurai whod commissioned it decided he liked it so much he didnt want the swordsmith telling anybody how hed forged it so after hed thanked the guy graciously deep bows and all the rest he picked up the sword bowed one more time and then hauled back and sliced him in half clean as a whistle the kesa stroke left collarbone straight through the right hip its said a samurai could do things such as that in the old days my meeting with noda had made me want to look it over to refresh my memory concerning that japanese capacity for the unexpected so after i let myself in through the front foyer i tossed my raincoat over a banister headed down to the kitchen to pour myself a nightcap and proceeded upstairs to the office i clicked on the light and then jesus the place had been trashed drawers open files tipped over piles of paper askew after the first numbing shock that perceptiondelay your senses impose before you can actually accept what youre seeing i quickly started taking inventory okay what did they get this time well the computer and printer were both intact cordless phone was there still the little nineinch sony in the corner was untouched hey could it be they hadnt actually lifted anything then i remembered why id come upstairs off to the side under the back stair was a big walkin closet i called my sword room always kept under lock and key i glanced over at the door hold on it was hanging open slightly i strolled over and checked it more closely the mechanism had been jimmied professionally but with enough force that the metal frame around the door was askew not a blatant entry but a determined one my heart skipped a beat thats why they didnt bother with tvs these guys knew where the real action was the lightweight very expensive loot i opened the door took a deep breath and felt for the light you could have heard my sigh of relief all the way out in the street from the looks of it nothing was missing here either be sure now i quickly glanced down the racks mentally cataloging the pieces everything had a place and all the places were still full strange this stuff was worth thousands burglars break in to steal so what happened maybe something scared them off my sheepdog benjamin the fearless terror of the streets he was now snoring at the foot of the stairs but who knows walton you lucky stiff this could have been a major hit i cursed at the thought of having to have the door and lock repaired made a mental note to remember to call the locksmith over by sheridan square in the morning and pushed the damaged door closed what a hell of a night i pulled the sothebys catalogue out of my pocket recalling the auction that had inaugurated this fateful evening and turned to chuck it in the file cabinet where i kept all the records for my hobby prices news clippings correspondence the rest the cabinet one of those cheap tin jobs you buy at discount officesupply places was slightly askew whats this i yanked open the top drawer and saw chaos uh oh i went down the row checking tell you one thing my intruders had been thorough every drawer was a mess just like the office then i got to the bottom the one with backup data on the collection appraisals provenance of the pieces that kind of thing it was empty but of course any pro would know that half the value of a collection such as this would be in all the documentation which meant my methodical thieves were no dummies theyd started with the paperwork the valuations and authenticity info which meant they werent through i must have interrupted their my god they could still be here i edged for the phone and punched the police emergency number next i went back and pulled down a sword just for protection and swept the empty house it was all nice and tidy finally new yorks men in blue showed an overweight irishman and his puerto rican partner both with mustaches i actually knew them having once received a ticket for walking ben off the leash we went through the formalities lots of questions with no answers worth writing down and then they offered to send around a fingerprint squad in the morning sure why not and youd better get new locks for this place mr walton right we all thanked each other and i saw them out then i headed back down to the kitchen what was this all about stealing files papers those documents lovingly and painstakingly assembled were what made the swords somehow uniquely a part of my life something that actually wasnt going to decide to take a hike the next week the stuff had no value to anybody except matt walton or so i thought chapter three some people will swear life runs on coincidence is it true if so heres one for the history books its the tale of an old flame before my exwife joanna before my later illstarred adventure with donna austen the ladys name was tamara richardson and she was a professor at new york university when i knew her though she was merely an assistant prof with a shiny new phd at any rate she was fresh out of columbias graduate school and very much starting out i was too best i can remember we met shopping for green groceries at balduccis just up sixth avenue from my place and we saw each other a few times it had to be at least fifteen years how time flies since our brief episode tam richardson however was not easy to forget there was a kind of underthesurface intensity about the woman that seemed always close to the ignition point when you were around her you were always worried somebody might accidentally light a match however she had no shortage of men in her life and eventually we each went our own way ships that passed in the night i never expected to hear of her again things didnt quite work out that way however she started getting famous as a thorn in the side of americas lackadaisical corporate management somewhere along the line tam richardson had taken it upon herself to singlehandedly kick some overpaid ass in americas plush boardrooms and she wasnt trying to win any popularity contests doing it she was the kid in the story who pointed out the emperor had on no pants while everybody else was claiming his tux was a great fit guess you cant fire somebody in academia merely for saying what everybody knows to be true but doesnt have the guts to verbalize then about a year ago i noticed a fulllength profile of her in an airline magazine spread about americas new achievers no escaping her between the lines i got the definite impression she hadnt really changed all that much over the years she was around five seven high cheekbones dark hair that looked like it could use a brush and eyes that made you think twice about giving her a lot of bullshit reminded me of say the young glenda jackson with a heavy spike of debra winger for my money though she was just about ideal in the female department trim bottom nice little twist in her stride just enough cleavage to make you wonder she didnt go out of her way to advertise but you figured the goods were on board my recollection in a nutshell tam richardson was a better than average looker damned smart and she knew no fear none there was something about her though that always left people puzzling whered she come from american sure but no way could she have been cornfed midwest like her surname the answer was she had a slightly more exotic and probably painful history than most of us maybe that was part of the reason she always seemed to be a loner never went along with the crowd the one time shed tried that it hadnt worked i got to know her well enough to hear a bit of the story but id sort of repressed the details maybe id do well to come clean and admit i still thought about tam from time to time whats more i gleaned from the magazine piece that she still lived right around the corner made me think briefly about giving her a call get together for a drink the old days etc but i finally decided id had enough highspirited women for a while time to mellow down why go looking for lightning in a bottle shed always liked three things goodlooking men telling the high and mighty unpleasant truths and interior design consequently it was no great surprise that the magazine devoted a photo spread to her rambling sixroom apartment the place was in one of those nyuowned buildings on the west side of washington square park and it was definitely a knockout shed played off the old classic interior a generously proportioned thirties layout turning it into an environment that blended technology and design not for tam though the utilitarian hightech look so trendy a few years back no ugly state of the art machines it was eclecticmodernism here deco there take her libraryoffice i smiled when i noticed that next to the latest ibm pc was a streamlined raymond loewy designed calculator pure thirties same old tam on the other hand just to keep it all from getting too serious she also had a collection of kitschy salt and pepper shakers scattered among the booksa dog peeing against a hydrant a naked babe with spicy boobs she told the writer it was her tribute to america the place was everything she was a potpourri of the world a mishmash of styles and she clearly loved it i probably missed a good half of the insider gags this outrage up against that one but i must say she brought it off with appreciable elan truthfully the place was a perfect reflection of the tam i remembereda woman who did her own thing she was now so it said a full professor at the university undoubtedly she deserved it she was also director of their new center for applied technology which shed founded when the interviewer asked her which department the center was under shed apparently shrugged and said certain people at the university wanted to bring it in under the school of business but the center had outside funding was doing vital work and she was darn well going to stay independent whoops that ballsy crack although perfectly in character meant she was now giving the back of her hand to university politics mouthing off in a national publication about some departmental power play is no way to endear yourself to college deans it lays bare all their petty empirebuilding didnt seem to worry her though just like in the old days she said exactly what she was thinking and let the chips tumble her major occupation in recent years as anybody who reads the oped pages around the country knows was to shame american executives into getting off their duffs to make them start diverting some of their executive perks into the serious problem of getting this country competitive again she had plenty of ideas where the corporatejet money could be better invested over the years shed knocked out half a dozen books on technology and the american workplaceoffice automation computeraided design in engineering robots and computerintegrated manufacturing that kind of thing tam richardson still believed america could whip the world but it would take more than speeches and flag waving her latest expose of americas corporate fat cats which actually got a sidebar in the story claimed theyd better start cutting their milliondollar salaries and putting the money into creating american jobs or wed all soon end up fetching coffee for the new pacific rim dynamos and buying our goodies at east asias company store only she didnt bother to say it that nicely worse than that the book actually supplied a long list of americas more notoriously overpaid ceos i suspect there were a lot of corporate contributors to the university whod just as soon seen her muzzled good luck tam now the coincidence the saturday following my friday night episode with the inscrutable president of nippon inc an event occurred that would soon bring tam richardson back into my life random luck fate anybodys guess as it turned out however while i was on the phone leaving messages at country clubs for the buildings attorneys a mere five blocks away from my place dr tamara richardson was putting the final touches on preparations for an evening dinner partydestined to throw us together again only weeks later the dinner was supposed to be strictly social to celebrate the beginning of her sabbaticalacademic talk for a year off with threequarters pay there were a few dinner debts to square away so the timing was perfect she had several articles lined up shed finally axed a stormy yearlong affair with a colleague in economics named david mason and she was scheduled to begin a book on intelligent robots she was trying not to think too much about academic politics and the real possibility her department chairman might consign her to some kind of academic hyperspace there to teach freshmen for the rest of her tenured days by midafternoon she was down to the lastminute refinements on the evenings plans since the overnight rain had purged the soot from the air she was feeling great she put on a new vangelis cd worked a few moderndance moves into her routine as she cleared the loose books out of the living room and continued trying to convince herself that breaking off with dave mason had been a smart move after a while though she wasnt humming anymore just thinking okay it had only been a week but why had she invited him to come to the dinner just to be a good sport the thing about it was theyd actually had a more or less unspoken understanding not to inquire too closely into each others occasional little diversions they were both adults right this time however dave had pushed it too far hed finally broken the rules bringing one of his admiring grad students up to the apartmenther apartment she bumped into them coming down in the elevator and this one was a prizestage makeup bleached hair the works out of bounds shed nailed him right there in her marble lobby you want to bang some queens debutante youd better not be doing it here this place is my home she then told him to pack the apartment was hers and she wanted all signs of him out by monday then shed invited him back for the dinner why could humptydumpty be put back together again crack eggs make an omelet she half smiled at the odd way your mind connects absurdities when youre a little overworked that was when the phone rang was it dave dropping out at the last minute to prove he could still piss her off one more time she headed for the kitchen so she could at least chop some veggies while they argued for half an hour on the phone it wasnt dave instead it was a scratchy old voice one she loved shouting into a cell phone at kennedy was allan stern who announced in his staccato tones that hed just stepped off a jal flight fresh from some conference in tokyo he had to see her tonight tonight when it rains it pours she thought allan id love to but im having some people in from school what well sure nothing that special allan i adore you dearly but you wouldnt know any of the okay okay can you get down by eight see you then tamara youre a dear stern was an old old friend and a guy everybody in the country had probably heard of vaguely any freshman in computer science could tell you he was one of the unofficial founders of the field known as artificial intelligence now usually shortened to ai as it happened she had convinced him the previous spring that they ought to collaborate on a book about the growing use of smart robots in the workplace but for some reason his input had never made it past the talking stage shed decided just to go ahead on her own with the writing well she thought maybe hes decided to pitch in after all great that would mean it might be adopted for a lot of college courses allan had plenty of respectability with the establishment he was probably the closest friend she had her mentor almost they went back to a denver conference fifteen years agp when hed stood up in a session and challenged the conclusion of the very first paper she ever gave though hed come in midway through even then he had been a powerhouse in washington chairing one of the technical committees that reviewed federal grant applications submitted by university researchers the inside talk on campuses was love him or hate him but think twice before you cross the opinionated bastard she was so mad she didnt care she had sidled up to him at the coffee break and introduced herself saying what an honor it was to meet a scholar so highly regarded a man whose reputation was so well established he nodded in absent acknowledgment sipped at his styrofoam cup and stared over her shoulder she then proceeded to advise the celebrated allan stern that hed missed the whole thrust of her talk which shed explained in the introduction and furthermorejudging from the data at handhe struck her as a pompous asshole such forthrightness which was entirely new to dr allan sterns sheltered existence so astonished him he apologized on the spot by weeks end he was trying to recruit her out to stanford he still was allan was always punctual to the minute and that saturday night was no exception the doorman downstairs announced him at eight sharp when she met him at the elevator her first impression was he looked a trifle worn down americas foremost futurist was gaunt as always but his trademark shock of white hair streamed over a lined face that was more than usually haggard his hard eyes which could bore through screwoff congressional staffers like a pair of black amp decker drills were actually bloodshot in short the man looked awful then she remembered hed just come in on the directly from narita into the teeth of the latest baggagehandlers slowdown at kennedy give the poor old guy a break she made him a drink and then asked okay allan whats up later tamara its a long story with which he lapsed silent very out of character about then everybody else started coming up reasonably on time since tam was known far and wide to hate the concept of fashionably late also she was a great cook bottles of bargain wine with the prices scraped off collected on the table in the foyer and coats amassed in the second bedroom given that everybody knew everybody it was mostly elbow patches and open collars only the women had bothered to dress simpson from computer science whose wife worked in admissions gail wallace from business whose pudgy skirt chasing husband had guided two companies into bankruptcy alice and herman knight who both taught in economics she was dean of the undergraduate college and published as a team kabir ali from mathematics and his browbeaten little iranian wife shirin who seemed frightened of the worldand her husband only dave had the nerve to be late and hold things up while they waited they knocked off a little scotch and white wine trashed the administration and complained about all the committees on which they were being pressured to serve around a quarter to nine dave finally appeared sandy curls askew to let her know where hed been she didnt even bother offering him a drink just announced that everything was ready so lets adjourn to the dining room therere two kinds of dinners ones that follow the rules and ones that break them all tarns were the latter this time it would be real tallow candles and everybodys wine including her own somehow her craziness always seemed to click they inevitably came back for more this time shed decided to pay an offhand tribute to autumn and american cuisine cheddar cheese soup marinated ottomanellis quail broiled with fresh sage sweet potato fritters and baby peas homemade corn bread and then as a change of pace keep em off balance an endive salad spiked with coriander dessert was an apple walnut casserole washed down with pots of mcnultys dark haitian coffee at the end she produced an ancient cognac you could inhale forever by eleventhirty everybody thought theyd just ascended to paradise she ordered dave to take care of the dishes since hed been acting as if he owned the place let him help then led everybody back into the living room in the park below the weather was perfect and marijuana sales were in overdrive a couple of joints also appeared around the room accompanied by withering glares from allan then while ed wallace was chatting up shirin and everybody else was drinking and smoking allan picked up his cognac and motioned her in the direction of the study finally she thought this must be some story she was right it wasnt her book he wanted to discuss instead he wanted to tell her about what hed just seen and not seen in tokyo loved dinner he settled into a leather chair the one next to her long bookcase and drained his snifter i was afraid i was turning into a fish over there he laughed but only briefly social hour was over tam i wanted to ask you if you could maybe help me out with something what do you have in mind well you know ive always thought i was on top of what tokyo is doing but now im not so sure anymore im afraid things are starting to get away from me such as okay now its no secret ive been to japan a lot ive got my share of friends over there people i respect and admire very much but this trip started to get very strange its as though im suddenly an outsider just another gaijin im puzzled and i wonder if maybe i ought to be worried gaijin that sounds familiar she thought but it wasnt something that usually bothered allan she brushed her brown hair back out of her eyes and studied him hed never been more serious what happened he paused you know about their big artificial intelligence effort called the fifth generation project if it goes the way theyre saying before too much longer theyll have programs software to design the next generation of computer technology this was supposed to be news come on allan everybody knew it was the talk of the industry japans goal was computer logic capable of replicating human thought processes a monumental maybe impossible undertaking allan dont you remember we discussed doing a chapter on it in the robotics book and if you tamara bear with me you also know very well that project is japans attempt to leapfrog american technology added together with all their r ampd on chip technology in my opinion by the way our response is definitely too little too late more and more were having to buy essential components for missile guidance systems from japan the department of defense is already nervous but not nervous enough we may have dug our own grave and now i think our worst fears may be about to come true something funny seems to be happening only im not sure what what do you mean let me close that door he got up and did so then turned back maybe first i ought to tell you about the odd experience i had last week go on she heard somebody in the living room put on one of her old beatles albumsstill the middleagers idea of hip well as always i scheduled a stop at the fifth generation lab to get up to speed on how their efforts doing but all of a sudden it seems im too darned famous to be bothered with the shirtsleeve stuff i tried to get in there for three days running it was always the honorable sternsan this and the celebrated sternsan that and you must meet the head of every damned ministry and we have to set up this formal dinner and blah blah blah allan youre the grand old man these days she laughed get used to it wash out your mouth tamara richardson im not grand and im most decidedly not old he sniffed no its as if they were very politely cutting me out okay they didnt exactly say the project was offlimits now or anything but there never seemed to be a convenient time to drop by the lab who knows maybe they just didnt want some american partisan poking about the place anymore could be but why im scarcely a spy for dod or the cia they know i only do pure science okay maybe im old fashioned but dr yoshida at least has always claimed to respect me for that i used to spend hours with him going over his work there and vice versa we swapped ideas all the time now all of a sudden theres this smokescreen he paused sipped at his brandy and then leaned back which brings me to that favor i need what well i was wondering if maybe you could try and get into the fifth generation lab yourself check around a bit see if you can find out whats cooking go to tokyo i realize its a lot to ask but who else can i turn to tam youre the only person i know who could pull this off you know the technology and they respect you also you understand the language maybe you can cut through all the politeness and the translated pr if youd like a little per diem ill see if i cant shake loose the money from somewhere allan really dont you think youre maybe going overboard just a little what if dr yoshida was just tied up the last time i visited the lab he showed me everything completely open ho ho he set down his brandy and his eyes hardened i still havent told you the clincher theres some new guy in charge now thats hard to believe yoshida practically invented the fifth generation project hes the director thats just it kaput all of a sudden hes not around anymore they said hes now technical adviser but you know what that really means removed sayonara promoted upstairs or downstairs or some damn thing that in itself is mystifying hes one of the most competent oh hell the man is a genius why would they do that very strange exactly but now hes out couldnt even see me on vacation the new director is some bureaucrat by the name of asano i spent a little time with the man and i can testify hes a smoothie lots of pious generalities about technical cooperation but i got the distinct feeling he didnt want to talk details with me actually i wondered if maybe he wasnt even a bit afraid to say anything asano oh shit she took a deep breath was his name kenji asano ken right thats his first name maybe you know him i think he used to be a flunky with some government bureau over there but now hes just been put in charge of the fifth generation work its more than a little curious she puzzled a minute from what she knew about the fifth generation and about kenji asano he had a lot more important things to do than run the lab the government bureau he worked for was none other than miti the ministry of international trade and industry in fact at last count he was deputy minister for research and planning a topranked executive slot could this mean that japans ambitious artificial intelligence effort was being moved in on by miti their industrial war room allan ill tell you the truth you may not have heard but im in a fight now at the university i expect to win but ive got a lot on my mind notes for the book i cant just suddenly tam i need your help look maybe theyve had some new breakthrough that none of us ever imagined he paused just between us i lifted a strange miti memo i found lying around an office when asana took me on an escorted tour up to the labs at tsukuba science city she looked at him was it classified how would i know there was something about it my sixth sense told me it was a document nobody was supposed to see when i get back to stanford i plan to have a postdoc over in physics make me a quick translation it was very unlike allan to walk off with confidential memos uninvited which could only mean he must suspect something he wasnt telling youd better give me the whole story not now not yet its only guesswork tam he glanced away nothing to bore you with at the moment but if you can find out anything well write it up as a report i can circulate around the hill this could be important believe me already cray has started having to buy critical chips for its supercomputers from japan and while the department of defense is pouring billions into research on semiconductors that will withstand nuclear radiation japan is forging ahead on speed and miniaturizationwhat really counts i think they could be about to have us by the balls pardon my french if theyve somehow incorporated ai allan it doesnt add up i once met asano in fact it was a couple of years ago at that kyoto university symposium on third world industrialization he spent a lot of time trying to pick my brain about our specialized siliconchip manufacturing here but he wasnt the slightest bit interested in artificial intelligence well prepare yourself for a surprise hes plenty interested now and knowledgeable but still its not like the japanese to do something like this install some government guy to run an r ampd program thats certainly true she strolled over looked down upon the park and began to want a brandy of her own as she chewed over the implications was miti setting up some new hightech industrial assault if the fifth generation had been taken over by kenji and his planners allan let me think about this for a couple of days dont think too long im convinced somebody over there is suddenly in a very big hurry i need to find out the real story am i just starting to go nuts in my old age well make that my prime he grasped her hand for emphasis and you really should make it a point to see this asano fellow if you already know him from somewhere id say thats even better she started to respond then stopped she knew kenji asano all right from a little episode at that conference when he had invited the panel members of a session he chaired to a latenight tour of the endless tiny bars in kyotos gion district she remembered all the steaming sake and being ignored by flustered bar girls who were pretending that another woman wasnt around they had no idea what to do about a member of their own sex there in their sanctuary of male flattery ken apparently had staged it mainly to watch their reaction and hers part of the scene was that ken asano was actually something of a hunk as westernized as they come and attractive in that way seemingly reserved for men of great wealth or great power he may have had both but she was sure only about the second whenever he handed out that meishi card with the miti logo even millionaire industrialists and bankers automatically bowed to the floor a lot of sake later after the other panel members had piled into a cab for their hotel she decided to show kenji asano a few things about women he wouldnt learn from giggling bar girls shed always heard that japanese men were pretty humdrum in bed quick and selfcentered at least in the opinion of a woman she knew whod done exhaustive field research on the topic after her own experience with ken though she wasnt so sure still it had been a passing thing the next morning she awoke in her own room in the kyoto international and half tried to tell herself it hadnt really happenedjust a dream a chimera of the sultry kyoto night brought on by all those quaint little side streets and red paper lanterns the truth was she still thought about him from time to time he was a talented lover she certainly recalled that part well enough and he was a charmer in fact she could use a little of that charm right this minute what she didnt admire was the organization he worked for the infamous miti behind a smokescreen of fair trade rhetoric mitis intentions clearly were to extinguish systematically japans world competition industry by industry and so far they were batting a thousand theyd never once failed to knock off a designated target what was next had miti finally concluded that down the road intelligent computers could be the drive behind some massive shift in world power maybe she should go she poured another dash of cognac for allan and they wandered back into the living room just in time to see the simpsons out everybody else followed except for dave now perched by the windows and glaring out into the dark she decided to ignore him as she walked over opened one a crack and looked down in the park below commerce was tapering off and the jamaican rastas had begun toting up receipts for the night no sounds except the faint strains of reggae from a boom box funny but every once in a while shed stop everything and watch the kids in the playground down there what to do the damned shadows were growing longer by the minute maybe dave wasnt so bad trouble was he needed mothering too think about it tomorrow scarlet she sighed poured herself a cognac and headed for the bedroom to get allans coat after shed put him on the elevator she came back and checked out dave now slouched in the big chair by the lamp his eyes closed he looked positively enticing and she sounded his name quietly nothing then she realized he was sound asleep snoring the bastard this was it she grabbed his coat pushed him out the door poured herself another cognac and plopped down in the living room to think all right allan youve got a deal could be youre on to something i seem to remember theres a conference in kyoto starting week after next on supercomputers kenji asano will probably show good time to catch him off guard and try to find out whats suddenly so hushhush yes by god ill do it she didnt bother with any of allan sterns funding this trip would be strictly offtherecord she wrapped up some loose ends called a few people she knew in tokyo lined up half a dozen interviews that might be helpful on the new book packed her toothbrush and tape recorder and boarded a northwest flight for narita she had no idea then of course but she was alice dropping down the rabbit hole a fortnight later she was dining with the emperor of japan chapter four allan stems alarm about japans semiconductor challenge reflected only part of the picture there was also plenty going on with japanese research in addition to information processing superconductivity was getting a big push as was biotechnology optoelectronics advanced materials although we in the west think of japan as a newcomer in the hightech sweepstakes it actually has a long tradition of innovation a typical forinstance in the area of advanced materials those of us hooked on swords know the japanese were already creating new materials hundreds of years ago that still havent been bettered back then it was flawless steel for katana blades today its say gallium arsenide crystals for laserdriven semiconductors how one might inquire did all this expertise come about to stick to materials research if you think a moment you realize its a discipline that actually must have begun in the latter days of the stone age high technology in those times meant figuring new ways to use fire and clay to create something nature had neglected to provide not integrated circuits but a decent water pot and the japanese have been making terrific pots for a thousand years as it happens some historians claim the very first japanese pottery was made in the province of tamba near kyoto why mention this because then as now technology and politics had a way of getting mixed together in japan and tamba was a perfect example tambas artisans made great use of a special oven known as a climbingchambered kiln whereas ceramics kilns elsewhere in the country were narrow and high tambas climbinghill chambers were wide and low thereby allowing the fire to touch the clay directly the result was a rugged flameseared stoneware that pleased the manly eyepowerful earthy grays burnt reds greenishbrowns all with a hard metallic luster thus tamba was a locale much frequented by the warrior shoguns which may be why tamba province has another claim to history as well it is the location of the onetime warrior castle fortress of sasayama once a regional command post of the tokugawa strongmen in tokyo you wont find overly much about sasayama in the usual guidebooks since it has the kind of history thats more interesting to japanese than to tourists the place has no gaudy vermilion temples no bronze buddhas ten stories high fact is very little remains of the fortress itself these days except for a wide moat green with lotuses and a few stone walls lined with cherry trees that blossom an exquisite white for a few breathtaking moments each spring although the castle is now burned down a few homes of the samurai retainers of its various warlords remain if you stand on the rocky edge of the moat at its southwest corner and look down through the cherry trees youll see an oldstyle house built some two hundred years ago by the twelfth daimyo of sasayama for his most loyal retainer its walls of white plaster are interspersed with beams of dark wood its thatch roof supported by the traditional ridgepole think of it as the home of the samurai most trusted the guardian of the gates the warrior nearest the fount of power perhaps it will not seem surprising therefore that this ancient samurai residence in the shogun stronghold closest to ancient kyoto was now home base for a powerful warrior of modern japan matsuo noda samurai had once battled in sasayamas streets manys the time its castle had been stormed by raging armies much blood had been shed and much honor lost but the event that occurred in sasayama precisely two weeks after tamara richardsons dinner in new york was a historical moment more important than any in its thousand years prior it began shortly after dawn a cool september gray just ripening to pink over the mountains the early sounds of morningbirdsong the faint bell of the tofu seller the steam whistle of the autumn sweetpotato vendorwere only beginning to intrude on the quiet noda was where he always was at this moment on the veranda overlooking his personal garden a classic zenstyle landscape whose central pond was circled by naturalappearing rocks trees bushes paths it was of course about as natural as those sculptured hedges at versailles in order to create the illusion of perspective and depth the stones along the foreshore of the pond were bold rugged massively detailed while those on the opposite side were dark small smootha little trick to make them seem farther away than they were its a game heavy with nuance for example the stone footpath on the left side of the pond may look as if it goes on forever but thats just part of the art the stones get smaller toward the back curving in and out among the azalea bushes till they make one last twist and disappear among the red pines and maples at the rear which trees incidentally have themselves been slightly dwarfed again enhancing the illusion of distance just as the back is deliberately shaggy and dark like the beginnings of a forest that goes on for miles nodas zen garden which deludes rational judgment by manipulating all the signposts we use to gauge distance and space appeared to be limitless the secret was that nothing actually ends everything simply fades out and gets lost it was a closed space that seemed for all the world as if it went on and on if you could only somehow see the rest of it yet peek only a few yards away and youve got the mundane streets of sleepy sasayama this special dawn as a few frogs along the edge of the pond croaked into the brisk air he knelt on the viewing veranda in a fine cotton morning robe a yukata emblazoned with his family crest an archaic chinese ideogram meaning courage and began to center his mind hed left his kyoto headquarters early friday evening skipping the usual afterhoursdrinking obligation of japanese executives and grabbing the eightthirty sanin express to sonobe where his limo waited to bring him the rest of the way home now he was up before daybreak and readying his usual morning ritual as he sat there gazing across the placid water dotted with lotuses at the foreshore and framed with willows at the far horizon his silver hair contrasted with the marine blue of the robe to create a presence easily as striking as the garden itself for a time he merely knelt silently contemplating the view and listening to the metrical drip of water from a bamboo spout situated just at the edge of the steps finally he turned and picked up his sumi stick a block of dried ink made from soot and carefully began to rub it against the concave face of an ancient inkstone till its cupped water darkened to just the proper shade when the fresh ink was ready he wet a brush in a separate water vessel dried it by stroking it against a scrap of old paper dipped it into the dark liquid and looked down this was the moment that demanded perfect composure absolute control before him was a single sheet of rice paper purest white and now his hand held the brush poised he was waiting for that instant when his senses clicked into alignment when the feel of the brush merged with his mind much the way a samurais katana blade must become an extension of his own reflexes although he would stroke only a few kanji characters scarcely enough for a telex or a memo the moment required discipline acquired through decades of practice his zenstyle calligraphy allowed for no hesitation no retouching it must be dashed off with a spontaneity that was in itself part of the art as with the swordsman there could be no time for conscious thought merely the powerful stroke guided by intuition no decision that confronted him throughout a business day would demand half so much mental control inner resolve just then at the far end of the pond the first sun flickered through the wisteria suddenly without his consciously knowing the exact moment had arrived as a zen archers arrow must release itself of its own will his hand struck the dark tip of the brush pirouetted down the paper starting at the left and laying down a mere five lines twentytwo syllables inishie ni once held ari kemu hito no its said moteri cho by men of long ago omitsuwa wo my ancient prize ware wa mochitari at last is near it was done he sighed leaned back and reached for the cup of green tea that rested beside him on the polished boards the verse was in an archaic style a few syllables longer than a haiku modeled on an eighthundredyearold work by a court poet of the heian era the strokes were perfectly nuanced the flow of the brush precise the intuitive strength as natural as a waterfall noda drained his tea then rose to go back inside his antique house was tastefully empty its tatamifloored rooms measured in multiples of those standard threebysix reed mats were barren a museum to times past they also were open to each other their sliding doors fusuma being pushed wide the walls too were vacant expanses of white plaster with only an occasional mounted sixfold screen depicting poetry parties of the heian era that courtly civilization portrayed in the tale of genji and there were no overhead lights merely an occasional cypress andon floor lamp to augment the pastel glow of the ricepaper shop windows asahan he curtly ordered his grayhaired cook to bring breakfast then turned to mount the ancient stairs hai she nodded and was gone although he kept the lower floor exactly as it had been two centuries past the upstairs was a different matter entirely it had been converted into a hightech office hooked through a maximum security telesystems tcs direct uplink via the midpacific mareksb satellite to the mainframe of his new nec information management system in the kyoto headquarters an augmented neax ims which handled voice data text image he had scarcely flipped on the system when the woman who managed his kitchen appeared bowing and deposited a tray bearing miso broth rice an uncooked egg and more tea he grunted thanks as he was checking a crt screen for the current rate on fed funds the cost of the money american banks lend each other overnight to meet reserve requirements no surprises then he turned and cracked the egg over his rice adding a leaf of dried nori seaweed as he leaned back chopsticks in hand he quickly glanced through the tokyo papers followed by the asian wall street journal and the satellite edition of londons financial times finally he tossed them aside this was always the moment when he liked to take measure of the three photos standing in a row across the back of his teak desk the first was his deceased wife marikolongsuffering deferential resignedly selfless a model japanese woman he still thought of her with fondness but as was expected of a japanese helpmate she always ran a distant second in his affections his work came first the next picture was very different this womans face was white her hair a lacquered wig her lips a tiny red pout her name koriko had been assigned years ago in the gion district of kyoto and she was holding a threestringed lute a samisen and intoning some classical melody from centuries past these days she purchased thousanddollar kimonos the way most office girls bought jeans but she worked for the money she was a geisha a real one an artist whose calling required years of training and commanded the awe of even the most modern japanese like a prizefighter or a matador shed spent long painful hours perfecting style technique art she had been nodas onetime protegee beneficiary of his patronage now though she had other patrons he still missed her but the memory was fading the third photo was a face familiar to all of japans avid tv viewersakira mori she was wearing a dark blue western suit her hair a glossy pageboy cut the conservative look of times past it was the occasion of her graduation from the school of law tokyo university tokyo daigaku or todai as its known an important moment todais alumni represent a network a batsu of the countrys ruling elite who compete with each other for the choicest most prestigious government ministries although she had chosen a more visible career she still relied heavily on her contacts in this governing clique heads of the leading ministries including finance foreign affairs and of course the ministry of international trade and industry miti matsuo noda himself had in fact once headed miti probably japans most powerful ministry he came from ancient samurai stockfittingly perhaps since the bureaucrats of modern japan are mostly of that class the samurai caste men who served a liege lord and were forbidden to engage in trade were actually japans first public servants in between civil wars they became swordcarrying bureaucrats many a modern bureau chief has ancestors who wore two swords and sliced up a peasant or a merchant now and then with impunity which may help explain why the average citizen still views government officials with such nervous awe a todai honors man himself noda was a natural for miti which runs what is in many ways a covert operation the head offices are in a nondescript sootcovered building of tinted glass and limestone near tokyos hibaya park guarded by armed helmeted members of japans national police inside its mostly open floors and lines of gray steel desks no plush carpets and mahogany suites miti has twelve bureaus each devoted to a major industrial sector if its officials decide japans strategic interests would be served by a certain manufacturing groups cutting production lowering prices altering product lines these recommendations are passed along and it happens noda began his career there by circulating through the different sections going around the track as its called after which he proceeded to run the general affairs office of various bureaus by which time everybody had him picked for a mover on the elite course eventually he was promoted to section chief in the international trade bureau next on to bureau chief and finally at age fortyseven he made the top vice minister after he reached the pinnacle he held the job for a mere five years then routinely left he had to go early fifties and youre out miti is no country for old men he moved on to head the japan development bank jdb where he financed various hightech startup industries finally he retired and went out on his own unlike most other retired government officials however he didnt accept any of the lucrative private offers he received the suddenly vacant spot on a conglomerates board of directors no he had his own smoldering vision in a dazzling and successful departure from usual japanese convention he founded nippon inc an adjunct to japans major financial players with headquarters in the commercial center of kyoto his new organization immediately became a financial fixture in the new postindustrial hightech japan and now five years later nippon inc was a thriving force in the management of capital these days even the new generation at miti routinely called him up for consensus for matsuo noda now everything was in place he was at last ready to pursue a lifelong dream hed never forgotten the end of the war that last day on okinawa when ushijimas nd army was a dazed remnant hed been in the cave above mabuni when the general radioed his farewell to imperial headquarters then severed his own spinal cord matsuo noda with anguish he could still remember had burned the regimental flag and told those remaining to scatter to become guerrillasrepeating ushijimas last command to fight to the last for the eternal cause of loyalty to the emperor noda had declared that their struggle would continue on for a hundred years if need be he had overestimated the difficulty the plan now poised had required less than fifty as usual for a workathome saturday just another business day in japan he was wrapping up loose ends from the week finishing reports signing off on audits two printers were running since he preferred to work with hard copy and he was reviewing the list of outstanding loans ni was in charge of monitoring checking for any early signs of trouble had any credit ratings slipped if a receiving corporation was publicly traded had its stock faltered what was the overview securities unamortized discounts on bonds cash on hand next he paged through the weekly updates from the small business finance corp the national finance corp the shoko chukin bank various credit associations and savings banks it was all on his kyoto information base pulled off the new fiberoptic network that linked japans financial centers he was about to ring down for fresh tea when a priority override flashed on the screen for his eyes only this meant a coded message that could only be unscrambled using a special module in the computer the kyoto office knew he was on line but they hadnt wanted to route the information directly highly irregular he punched in the code called up the receiving routine and waited for the message there had been a call from shiptoshore phone the communications line linking him directly with dr shozo takahashi directorincharge of his top secret project in the inland sea the director was requesting that nodasama contact him immediately via scrambler top security he felt his pulse begin to race as he digested the news it had been so easy almost too easy he sat perfectly still for that timeless historic moment gazing at the photograph of akira mori a promise kept from long long ago four decades now and he had never forgotten what he had said he would do for her he called down for tea waited till it had been delivered then punched on the phone and switched it to the security mode but even on the scrambler takahashi began circumspectly as the esteemed nodasama was aware their project had over its three years contended with great difficulties and many disappointments they were working at the very limits of undersea technology as nodasama also knew he went on their early attempts at seismic vertical profiling had been a complete failure takahashi took personal responsibility for that next they had changed strategy and utilized stateoftheart microwave radar hoping that minuscule changes in density along the bottom might indicate what they sought that too takahashi apologized had been unproductive from the start as nodasama had been informed and he takahashi took full blame for the failure noda cut in at that point impatient and wanting to circumvent the litany of apologies why was takahashi calling the director paused dramatically then declared he wished to inform the august nodasama that their latest approach the use of a new digital magnetometer had at last borne fruit only this morning they had detected and brought up an item in the treacherous straits eastnortheast of shikoku it was a watertight gold case embossed with what appeared to be a sixteenleaf chrysanthemum or kiku the imperial insignia other confirming inscriptions noda nervously reached out and clicked off the humming computer yes the formal script across one end appeared to be no later than tenth century although they dared not open the gold case for fear of damaging its contents at this moment preliminary analytical procedures were underway and the early results including a makeshift attempt at shipboard xray crystallography suggested that the steel inside which clearly showed traces of copper alloy contained less than a hundredth of one percent of iron oxide in short it was possible the item might be perfectly preserved it was theirs takahashi said in that breathy clipped language inferiors use to signify great importance and great deference it was his extreme honor to announce to the esteemed nodasama that the most important archeological find in the history of japan now belonged to nippon inc and they chigau noda cut him off in the curt tone expected of superiors incorrect it belonged to its rightful owner and would now be returned and furthermore he added nippon inc had just ceased to exist since the name for ancient japan was dai nippon great japan as of this moment nippon inc had just become dai nippon international a complete reorganization would begin immediately finally he ordered a total blackout radios silenced no shore leave for crew or scientists he clicked off the phone and repressing a tremble descended the stairs and there on the garden veranda using a new brush and perfumed sumi ink from his rare collection matsuo noda composed a very elaborate letter long swirls of black down a perfect sheet of thick flowered paper hundreds of years old it was then sealed in a silver case and hand delivered by special messenger to a fortress in the center of tokyo five days later its recipient read it before a nationally televised press conference and japan exploded chapter five kami wo araitai no desu ga ii desu ka tam peered through the doorway and nodded hello to the girl in the blue imperial hotel uniform the hair salon was almost empty perfect hai so the girl startled at the gaijins accentless japanese bowed to the waist dozo manikyua mo onegai shimasu what the heck tam thought why not go all the way get a manicure too hai dozo another bob as the girl ushered her forward there was the plush padded chair big gray and voluptuous she sighed and settled back heaven perfect peace in the middle of hectic tokyo she knew that here for an hour or so she would be an honored guest smothered with attention one of the most incredible experiences in japan while three of the girls began shampooing her hair they went back to chattering about the new husband a matchmaker had just arranged for the petite assistant in the back the bridetobe was blushing and there were plenty of giggles all around hands over mouths tam realized though that the girls were being a little circumspect who was this strange brunette gaijin speaking japanese with no accent maybe she understood what they were saying she did the woman who would become tam richardson was born tamara noname in kobe japan the somewhat embarrassing result of an evenings diversion for an anonymous gi her mother equally anonymous had prudently given her over for adoption rather than face the social awkwardness of raising a fatherless half gaijin child she was eventually adopted by lieutenant colonel avery richardson us air force and his wife mary proud iowa stock six years after shed been stuck in the orphanage that was during the latter days of the occupation but theyd stayed on in japan through while lieutenant colonel richardson served as adviser for the rearming of what would be the japanese self defense forces hed also become a japanophile by then so he left her in a japanese school rather than subjecting her to the army brats on the base finally they returned to the states with a darkeyed little daughter whod spoken japanese for almost a decade and being the achiever she was read it virtually as well as a highschool graduate the thing she remembered best from all those years though was one word gaijin it wasnt exactly that the modern japanese consider gaijin inferior they no longer dismiss westerners as redbearded barbarians no gaijin were merely unfortunate luckless folk not part of the earths elect tribe you were either born a part of japan a full nihonjin or you were forever outside of it gaijin but knowing it was one thing and living it as a kid was something else she wasnt one of them and they made sure she got the message finally however she discovered the hidden secret of japan most japanese get very uncomfortable around a gaijin too fluent in their language or customs since that outsider has penetrated their life without the constraint of relationships and obligations no gaijin can ever entirely belong to their seamless culture for one simple reason no outsider could ever be held accountable to the powerful social and family interdependencies that allow a population half that of the us to get along in a place functionally smaller than california so to survive there if youre not nihonjin you just play that fact for all its worth then like everybody else youve got a niche yours merely happens to be outside the system as an almostnihonjin youre threatening as a gaijin youre safe shed finally learned this the hard way from all those unsmiling little girls in blue school uniforms who used to hiss gaijin but thanks to them tam richardson learned to be a permanent outsider and a survivor well here she was again ready for another bout round eyed tamachan all grown up and still on the outside though she knew tokyo well from times past she was still trying to readjust after checking into the imperial hotel in tokyos hibiya section shed showered changed and headed out for some joggingthe best way she knew to see a lot of the city quick her major puzzle where to look for the new impulse behind japans big drive their meteoric move toward the target of dai ichi number one in the world try to feel the vibes she told herself be a tourist and see the new japan through fresh eyes if it had been winter shed have gone straight over to shinobazu pond in ueno park to watch the migratory siberian waterfowl diving for fish among the clumps of floating ice in spring she would have first monitored the radio to find out which park had the finest cherry blossoms then gone somewhere else to avoid the sakeswilling crowds and if it had been summer she probably would have headed for the cool of the imperial palace east gardens to catch the pink and red azaleas autumn though was a time for swallowing the city whole she started with the meiji shrine that garish tribute to japans westernization then moved on to the imperial palace itself a place that like tokyo itself had something for all seasons she passed through the east gardens watching provincial honey mooners snapping pictures for the parents back home then worked her way across toward the sakuradamon gate so she could follow the palace moat as she made her circuit back to the hotel along the way she passed the diet building and the supreme court then decided to look in on the yasukuni shrine buried in its own exquisite grove of cherry trees and mixed foliage the massive bronze torii arch leading into the shrine was always surrounded by stalls selling those marvelous little rice cakes sweet and leaden she remembered as a kid she stopped and bought two by then she was experiencing advanced jet lag so she decided to head on back to her crispsheeted bed at the imperial tokyo this time around was as impossible as always maybe more so where do you start the garish ginza the selfconscious trendiness of roppongi the skyscrapers of shinjuku solemn marunouchiall of it engulfing awesomely materialistic each trip the city seemed to get bigger louder more everything more cars more neon more yes more money she could remember almost a time when this town was a burnedout ruin now she needed some time to think to work out a game plan sure clues to the phenomenon of modern japan were everywheredrive selfconfidence competencebut how did they fit together change was coming like an avalanche who could keep track the best thing shed told herself was to start with a clear head back off for a while after all the last year had been much toil and little play with the latest book coming out hassles at the university she needed some unwinding maybe a little time spent thinking about nothing would be best of all so for a day she lived off room service immersed herself in the local papers magazines tv and just relaxed she let allans hints about some ominous new development slip way down the scale one of the things she couldnt help noticing though was an odd stirring in the newspapers something very much between the lines but all the more real for that very reason in typical fashion signals were going out that a major event was in store the government she knew always used a kind of earlywarning system for important shifts very japanese if the bank of japan was about to raise or lower interest rates a move that would impact thousands of businesses and banks for days in advance various unidentified officials would be quoted as speculating that maybe a change in rates might be possible of course they didnt actually say it was going to happen they merely hinted it could be an idea to consider it was plausible conditions might well warrant anybody with any sense knew immediately this meant the decision was already made and citizens were being alerted to cover themselves posthaste consequently if government sources start hinting an event is conceivably possible you can usually assume its as good as fact but what was this about she wondered all these allusions to a new interest of the emperors the standard elements were all there leaks guesswork columns unnamed high sources no doubt something major was pending and just to make sure nobody missed the importance of whatever it was there was even speculation his majesty might actually hold a press briefing that last possibility she decided was clearly farfetched just not done a picture session maybe but that was it after a day of unwinding she was ready to get out and start gathering some information this time around however she wanted a different image a shift from the staidprofessor look to hightech japan start with a few clothes something smashingexpensivedesigner japanese and the hair right a cut a different style a something thus around noon the third day she finally got into street clothes and headed down to the lobby then teeming with laggedout aussies in funny tour hats she took one look ducked around them then made for the lower arcade and the shops and here she was already feeling recharged relaxed and just then a short excited hotel porter ducked his head in bowed and announced hed just heard that the emperor was about to be on tv his majesty the salon froze at first tam thought the porter must just be playing some kind of local prank arcade high jinks then she remembered the speculation in the papers could it be true she glanced at her watch it was a couple of minutes before twelve the girls immediately dropped everything and clicked on the big toshiba digital set suspended over the mirror service halted in midstream just as in a soba noodle shop when the sumo wrestlers on the corner tube had finished glaring thrown salt three times and were ready to lunge then one of the hairdressers remembered tam andmaybe still believing no gaijin could understand her languagereached down to snap on the small blackandwhite sony attached to the chair arm tuned to cnns tokyo service it was currently scrolling temperatures in the us now on the big toshiba overhead nhk the government channel was announcing they were about to switch to a remote broadcast live from the sacred yasukuni shrine uh oh she thought yasukuni has everybody here gone crazy back before yasukuni had been a memorial to the master race official home of the new state shinto japans militarists had revised traditional shinto a simple nature reverence to include violent nationalism emperor worship the yamato spirit the way of the samurai every warlike aspect of national character these days yasukuni enshrined the names of japans two million heroic war dead a roll call recently enlarged to include tojo and others the us later executed as criminalswhich had turned the place into a political hot potato resulting in an enormous flap when the prime minister tried to appear there in his official capacity so for the emperor to show up suddenly with heavy press coverage was almost unthinkable besides shed just been by the place and hadnt noticed anything this was very sudden then the remote came on the front of the shrine was roped off right across the bronze torii gate with only cameras and press allowed inside on screen was a shot of an elaborate new dais where an official from the imperial household agency the government bureau that kept his majesty under its care and schedules his appearances was just finishing up a longwinded introduction then it was the prime ministers turn after what seemed half an hour of absolutely contentless oratory a japanese politicians most respected skill on the subject of the countrys majestic imperial past the pm finally stepped aside to allow a tall strikingly handsome japanese man to approach the speakers podium since the occasion had official significance his walk was ceremonial with his feet wide apart in the jerky samurai swagger necessitated in days of old by the two swords at the waist meanwhile everybody around him was bowing low his imperial majesty wearing a formal male kimono equivalent to morning dress at ascot looked truly august he was also carrying a long silver box filigreed when he finally started to speak the girls around tam gasped in astonishment she noticed immediately that he wasnt using modern japanese instead his language was an archaic highly ornate dialect the court speech of long ago after his brief almost unintelligible prologue one of the household officials opened the box for him and took out a long scrolled document the cameras did a quick closeup showing a page of antique flowered paper inscribed with brush and sumi ink it turned out to be a letter in modern japanese from the president of a financial organization called dai nippon international as the emperor read it to the cameras it began with a recounting of the loss of the imperial sword in the inland sea during the battle of dannoura that sword it declared signified japans physical link to a divine past what history on tv then came the bomb abruptly cnn cut into their normal latenight programming for a live satellite report their reporter grasping a mike and standing in front of the milling mob around the podium was reading from a press handout that provided an english summary of the letter since the cnn signal was being flashed to the us and then back to japan on the bird effectively circling the globe it was a few milliseconds behind the nhk broadcast she turned up the sound noon here in tokyo and at this shrine sacred to all japanese his majesty the emperor of japan cut to shot of the emperor speaking reporter voiceover has startled the nation by announcing that marine archeologists working for an investment organization called dai nippon international have just succeeded in recovering a famous symbol of early imperial rule a threeyear secret project in the inland sea funded by dni culminated five days ago when scientists brought up a watertight gold case containing what is believed to be the original imperial sword cut back to reporter although no photos of the sword have as yet been released we are told it is in virtually mint condition glances down to read from press release according to the ancient japanese chronicles this sword was given to japans first emperor by the sun goddess amaterasuomikami sometime around the year bc as a symbol of his divinity historians say it was later lost at sea in the battle of dannoura that bloody naval episode the subject of much japanese lore and tradition marked the end of direct imperial authority here and the rise of the first shoguns military governors who would rule in his name she rolled down the sound who needed some english press summary she was watching the whole incredible event live as it unfolded and her first thought was good god thats like finding excalibur or maybe the ark of the covenant myth turned into reality she glanced around the salon and already the electricity in the air was crackling but what happened next turned out to be the real news the hidden agenda after his majesty finished reading the letter he passed it to an underling and switched back to his ancient dialect now though his speech was being translated across the bottom of the screen into modern japanese he declared that since the imperial household through the loyal services of dai nippon international had had restored to it that which it always possessed namely the sword he was pleased to honor the firm by allowing it to construct a new museum to house the sacred symbol at a site just outside ise home of the official shrine of the sun goddess on his authority groundbreaking for the museum would begin immediately however until such time as it was constructed and consecrated the imperial household would make the sacred relic available under heavy guard for viewing by the japanese people in a temporary showplace located at the meiji shrine in tokyo by now shops had begun closing and the corridor outside was in tumult an excited young clerk from the flower stall next door burst through the door and bowing to everybody lavished bouquets on all the girls from the streets above came a cacophony of sirens but it still wasnt over the most crucial part of all totally missed by the western news force was yet to come after his majesty was bowed away from the microphone another official stepped forward to elaborate on the emperors remarks probably because his majesty would not deign to mention anything so crass as money as reward for restoring the sword to his majesty he said dai nippon would be allowed to serve as trustee of an official honorary investment instrument to be known as the eighthundredyear fund acting for his majesty dni would direct those monies into endeavors commensurate with the nobility and ancient lineage of the japanese people as symbolized by the sword then a telephone number flashed across the bottom of the screen the current subscription would be closed after eight hundred billion yen were pledged the president of dai nippon had asked his majesty for the honor of contributing the first billion yen personally finally in a quick aside he added that interest paid by the fund would of course be taxfree as was normally the case for savings accounts in japan after a few closing formalities interspersed with a photo session of the emperor and the president of dai nippon the historic occasion ended with a reverential shot of his majesty being escorted to his limo who was that silverhaired executive tarn wondered the man was audacious and a genius hed just turned the imperial household into an accomplice in some kind of nationwide collection using the emperor for his own ends much the way shoguns of old had done but she sensed hed touched a nerve that went very deep a fund in honor of the emperor thats already how everybody around her in the shop was describing it something in which to take pride not just a numbered savings account at the post office suddenly the girls and their japanese customers were all talking money here was something they could do to show their regard for his majesty a line was already forming at the phone the way she heard sums being pledged she calculated dai nippon would garner five million yen more than thirty thousand dollars right there among the shampoos and curlers the typical japanese she recalled banked over a quarter of his or her disposable income little wonder most of them had at least a years salary in savings at this rate dai nippons imperial fund would be over the top by nightfall that evening nhk newscasts claimed it had been fully subscribed in the first fiftysix minutes after all eight hundred billion yen was only about six billion dollars scarcely more than loose change to a people saving tens of millions every day it was in fact merely the beginning the next day more eighthundredyear funds were opened by popular demand soon the pension funds started to feel the heat and a lot of institutions began calling up yen flowed in a great river all those homeless japanese billions knocking around the world had at last found a guiding ideal some rumors even claimed the emperor himself was actually going to manage the money tam couldnt wait to get outside and see firsthand what was going on this was something allan could never in his wildest dreams have predicted as soon as she could get her hair dry she headed out the girls didnt even bother to charge tokyo twelve million strong was in the streets even in normal times the city could be overwhelming but now it was in pandemonium an advanced state of shock as she struggled through the crowds a lot of men were waving sake flasks already gleefully smashed the sidewalks had become one vast matsuri festival something else too she found herself feeling a little uncomfortable there were glares and then as she passed a withered old man running a noodle stand she heard him mutter gaijin what did it mean what it meant she reflected with alarm was obvious the world had just become a brandnew ball game japans longsilent emperor had once more spoken to his people just as he had at the end of the war back then he had broken two thousand years of silence to inform his battered starving subjects the war situation has developed not necessarily to japans advantage this time around he had confirmed japans long imperial heritage the meaning was clear as day this wasnt a new direction this was just getting back on track even though the emperor had been humiliated and secularized after the great war against the threatening gaijin his people still thought of themselves as a single pure family for a time they merely had no focus for that identity now they had it again well she thought why not national pride not so long ago we americans had the soviets telling us we were second best so we blew a few billion in tax money to plant a man on the moon and straighten them out the space super bowl why should japan be any different for years now theyve heard half the world claim theyre just a bunch of harddriving merchants with a bankaccount soul when they knew in their hearts it wasnt true now heres the proof straight from the sun goddess time to get crazy awhile in the middle of all the bedlam and horns and sirens in the street she yearned for somebody to talk with somebody levelheaded enough to put this frightening turnaround into some kind of perspective thats when she thought of ken of course he was westernized he took the longer view why hadnt she thought of him right away so off she went for a quick surprise visit with kenji asano at the institute for new generation computer technology research headquarters for the fifth generation systems project he and his staff would probably be in a holiday mood just like everybody else maybe hed loosen his tie and give her a little offtherecord rundown of what this was all about she knew the institute operated out of the twentyfirst floor of a downtown tokyo skyscraper shed been there before she still had the address and the subways were clicking along right on time though the fare machines were off now in celebration half an hour later she was there she pushed her way through the milling lobby and grabbed an elevator as she rode watching the lights tick off the floors she found herself wondering again what ken was really up to and what had happened to dr yoshida however it was hard to think about something as boring as miti and american defense vulnerability when people were whooping it up and passing around paper cups of sake right there on the elevator well dont jump to conclusions this paranoia of allans is probably just some grotesque misreading dr yoshida got promoted and kens merely filling in for a while till the institute can recruit a new director from some university the work heres too important for politics intelligent computers are japans lifelinethe steam engine of the next century how would ken react to her just showing up after all kyoto was two years ago hed claimed to be a widower but was that merely conference fast talk best thing is just to play it straight she told herself strictly business let the rest fall out in time as she stepped off the elevator she was relieved to see that the offices were still open well she thought my first finding is that ken asano runs this place with an iron hand just the way yoshida did total dedication through floortoceiling glass doors she could see the receptionist at the desk now excitedly chatting on the phone tam waved and the smiling woman immediately buzzed her through just like that no different from the last time doesnt look to be any miti conspiracy here she thought what exactly had made allan so worried she bowed and handed over her meishi her business card asanosan onegai shimasu chapter six matt why dont you just send your action over to the bean pit for chrissake the phone line from chicago crackled thats where the crapshooters are jerry i wouldnt know a soybean if i ate one hell half of those loonies over there buying and selling bean contracts wouldnt know one either come to think of it i dont know anybody over on the merc whos ever even seen a pork belly do they really exist he was yelling to make himself heard over the din of the floor of the board of trade futures on commodities were being bought and sold all around him just then he paused followed by a louder yell right ill buy five at the market yeah im talkin one and thirteen bid what youve got to be kidding no way pause i could almost see the bluejacketed floor traders frantically handsignaling each other then he yelled again christ frank im already long forty at sixteen im getting murdered here you guys are killing me all right all right ill pay fourteen for ten yeah shit hang on matt i gotta write this down on a ticket jesus i should be selling hondas like my brotherinlaw down in quincy sits on his butt all day screws his bookkeeper at lunch and the mans making a bundle pause hell matt whatd i just say if i heard right you just bought ten thirtyyear treasury contracts at one oh one and fourteen thirtyseconds you just agreed to loan the us government a million dollars jerry very patriotic except youre probably going to turn around and unload the contracts in the next five minutes to somebody else oh yeah right i should be so lucky christ wheres my pencil this place is driving me nuts i think my minds going ive gotta shorten up some here before the close hang on he yelled at a runner to take his buy slip then came back to the phone matt youre really shaking this place up you know guys are starting to back away and the people upstairs are beginning to wonder youve gotta think about going off exchange with some of this hit the marketmaker banks we cant keep up with you here i could try to get the exchange to waive their position limits but dont hold your breath no problem jerry my clients got plenty of other accounts well roll the next thousand contracts

my hands or im gonna get blown out jesus howd i let myself get this long at sixteen forty fucking contracts and i was sure hey gotta run think i see some idiot over there signaling a seventeen bid kid must be from mars good luck right maybe ill try prayer he was gone id known jerry brighton since we crossed professional swords once in the late sixties and id never seen the man actually sit down he gave up law early and these days he elbowed the mob in the treasury bond futures pit with the grim determination of a horse addict shoving his way to the twodollar window if the bonds were sluggish hed roam the floor looking for action football you name it hed make up bets rumor has it one slow day he even set up a wager pool taking odds on which floor trader would be the next to go broke tap out in exchange parlance id guess jerrys own number was pretty low a reliable source once told me jerryd averaged a million a year for the past five even while taking a hit year before last for over two million when a certain famous inside trader sandbagged him with a phony merger rumor maybe it was worth the ulcers thing is i know for a fact hed have done it for nothing a born market maker right down to his rubbersoled reeboks so when jerry brighton started complaining that matsuo nodas action was growing too rich for his blood i knew we were in the big time it took a lot to impress a pro like him the thing was getting scary but it was still perfectly legal let me summarize roughly what had happened over the three weeks since i had decided to play along with matsuo noda first were the physical arrangements to accommodate my new calling id enlarged my operating spacethe back room of the brownstones parlor floor looking out over the garden into a makeshift brokerage office complete with a multilined telephone and quote services from stron and telerate id also installed a direct tieline to the tbill pit of the chicago mercantile exchange ditto the note and bond action at the chicago board of trade and because of all the computer hardware i had to move emmas desk out into the parlor consequently she could no longer listen in on my calls which she did not take kindly however i was no longer forced to listen in on hers i figure that sort of made us even in addition id set up accounts at every futures brokerage house in the land both coasts to spread out the orders we were moving a lot of contracts and the bigtime outfits like salomon brothers were scrambling to make a market for us once again therefore nagging questions began to arise anybody whod thought about it for more than a minute would have realized you cant make a play like nodas without being noticed theres no bigger rumor mill than the financial arena the very idea of shorting the bond market to the tune of billions and remaining obscure and anonymous for any length of time was absurd after all therere two sides to every bet but since i was supposed to be fronting his move specifically to throw sand in everybodys eyes all this attention presented something of a quandary although we were trying to keep the lid on buying small batches of treasuries even as we were shorting them the price was softening and margin calls were starting to loom on the horizon none of this made any sense noda wasnt hedging or even speculating in the normal sense he was playing a giant game of cat and mouse with the markets this told me once again he wasnt showing all the cards in his hand he had something major and unexpected in the pipeline which brought forth the next insight matsuo noda didnt hire me merely because he wanted some innocentseeming outsider to do his bidding in the futures market any number of players in this town could have handled that action as well or better no hed sucked me into his operation for some entirely different purpose at the moment known only to him but what more to the point why welcome to friday and my rather disturbed life want to know what really disturbed me the most seeing my new employer on cnns prime news standing there right next to the emperor of japan seemed as though i wasnt the only one now under nodas spell all of a sudden my mildmannered client had become a worldclass japanese mover and shaker and that made me very nervous needing a little perspective i decided to invite down dr william j henderson respected thinker and booze hound as it happened he had a little time to kill that friday before his late date with some advertising exec who was flying in from an assignment on the coast since three weeks had gone by since our talk up at martells it seemed like a good occasion to get together and compare notes true to his word he had formally resigned from the presidents council of economic advisers though hed reluctantly agreed to serve as a forecasting consultant for wharton econometrics hed also caused some unsettling rumors in the world markets by putting on some very heavy straddles in december gold futures and oil he called it insurance predicting hed be covered no matter what happened looked at another way though bill henderson was quietly shifting out of paper money and into commodities and when henderson started hedging you knew the weather forecast was unsettled to stormy it turned out hed also uncovered a few stray elements of what might well be a much bigger game nothing solid at that point but enough to stir him up know who runs that outfit youve taken on as a client he leaned back in one of the leather chairs in the upstairs parlor new pair of guccis glistening and sampled his third drink guy by the name of matsuo noda henderson who do you think i was talking to up at sothebys the other night you check your wallet afterward were talking heavy guns my friend he snubbed out what must have been his tenth dunhill in the last hour you didnt tell me he was the honcho behind all this you didnt ask know anything about him not till last week i started to do a little checking and first thing i know im stumbling across his name everywhere i look he studied the glass in his hand tell you something about this noda the man drops a quarter you let him pick it up himself hell nail you where the sun dont shine definitely a bad news mother you mean that business with the sword nah what in hell do i know about swords thats your toy box im talking about the real world friend turns out matsuo noda was the prime mover in one of the biggest takeover plays of the century what takeover they dont screw around with corporate takeovers in japan they dont take each other over they take other businesses over washington may think that war back in the forties is over but somebody neglected to pass the word to miti seems theyve got the idea it was just the opening skirmishthe only folks who surrendered were the army and navy henderson grew ominously serious for a change question is wheres this thing headed is the idea of turning our industrial base into a packaging operation for imports some kind of conspiracy or is it just nature takin its course conspiracy that wasnt a word henderson threw around lightly in fact he tended to scoff at conspiracy theories claiming they were a substitute for hardheaded analysis i agreed so what was he driving at i pressed him he paused to light a cigarette i bring up this unsavory possibility because im beginning to detect a little operation codenamed eat an industry henderson thats my game i pitch in to help the little fish fend off the big ones no offense friend but you probably couldnt even get into the ball park where noda and his boys are playing were talking the very big leagues here now hold on a second nodas not interested in companies hes just shooting a little craps from what ive seen so far the guy seems to be completely on the upandup in fact looked at from the long view you might even say hes putting money into this country never mind its just the wall street casino sure he is its like he first kicks the shit out of you then hands you a coke sos youll feel refreshed what in hell are you talking about well lets back up a notch since i dont want to badmouth your new client why dont you let me give you what ill call a purely hypothetical case he sipped at his scotch lets suppose you were a japanese guy like matsuo noda for instance and you wanted to take over some strategic american industry and ship it to japan howd you go about it well have a drink counselor he plunged forward and let me tell you a little fairy tale about how matsuo noda ate the american semiconductor industry noda it was miti actually but noda was running the ministry when they did it and he was the guy who set up the play noda ran miti this was news to me yep vice minister then he went on to greener pastures being the japan development bank and left the details to another miti honcho by the name of kenji asano according to my sources though it was noda who handled the tricky part the money after he went over to the bank got it together laundered it and dispensed it laundered it cant think of a better word miti carefully made sure the kickoff funding from the japan development bank got passed through a shell organization called the japan electronic computer company hoping nobody would trace it back to the government i think youre starting to see things but id like to hear this little fantasy okay off we go to the land of makebelieve once upon a time not too long ago and not too far away a few guys at intel or bell labs or some damn place got the mindboggling idea you could shrink down a computers memory and put it onto a little sliver of silicon no biggern a horseflys ass various outfits tinkered around with the concept and eventually it got commercialized lo and behold silicon valley was born where they start turning em out by the bucketful by were talking a fivebilliondollar industry kids barely old enough to drink legal got so rich they just gave up counting the money the american dream herr doktor that it was now they were making a memory chip called a k ram thats sixteen thousand bits of random access memory storage orders are pouring in and they cant buy the bmws fast enough out in silicon valley i know all about that well theres more seems noda and asano and their honchos at miti had been watching this and thinking over the situation they decided probably rightly that whoevers got the inside track on these computer chips has the future by the balls twenty years from now theres nothing gonna be made except maybe wheelbarrows that dont use these gadgets so round about they concluded they ought to be the ones in the drivers seat miti targeted integrated circuits well why not were the ones told them they were supposed to be capitalists in truth but just like in fairyland our princess had a problem see these chips werent as simple to copy as an internal combustion engine or even a transistor theyre a heck of a lot more complicated and to make things worse back when america was inventin these silicon marvels nobody in japan wouldve known one if itd bit him on the butt so its a tall order he crumpled an empty cigarette pack and reached in his coat for another now imagine youre these guys in miti you want to take over an industry you dont know the first thing about howre you gonna start id probably begin by licensing the patents nice try but you dont want this job to be too straightforward then everybodyll suspect whats happening and besides it wouldnt be as much fun so if youre this guy noda you decide to set up a sort of manhattan project like america had to make the first abomb you go over to see nippon telephone and telegraph their at ampt and you say boys we just decided youre gonna pitch in with all you got after that you commandeer some labs at toshiba and nec then you get yourself a batch of these little american gizmos and start trying to figure out how the hell they work henderson poured himself another drink then turned back now since you need to catch up fast you do a little reverse engineering which means you steal the other guys r ampd you take a bunch apart and decide youll go with the k ram chip made by mosteka big outfit here thats since gone belly up by the way thanks to our friends at miti and by youve made yourself a mostek clone bingo youve got the technology i think im beginning to get the drift whoa buddy youre just starting to get rolling he forged on by this time everybodys wanting these chips so all of a sudden silicon valley cant keep up now you and your boys at miti are ready to move youve got the knowhow so all you need to do is start turning them out by the truckload of course that takes millions and millions in plant investment so you do what asano did bring your old pal noda back into the picture since hes now running the japan development bank he obligingly lines up a whole shitload of cheap money for these outfits gearing up to chop americas nuts off all in all he gets together what amounts to a subsidy of low interest bucks to the tune of about two billion dollars all carefully laundered ready set go silicon valley glances up from countin its receipts and all of a sudden from out of nowhere here come your japanese chips reeeal cheap since youve got all these cheapo loans to capitalize your plants inside a year youve got nearly half the market now you figure somebodys surely going to blow the whistle so you cant believe your luck when silicon valley thinks youre some kind of joke come on in they say and sell as many of those crappy k models you can since weve got ourselves a hot k version cooking and thats where were gonna make our real killing when you hear this you do a quick retool and while the valley is seeing how sexy and expensive a design they can come up with your thrifty gang back home just sticks together a bigger version of that k chip you stole from mostek in the first placeand youre out front with a k now its time for hardball so you flood america with these things you drop the price of your k ram chips from thirty dollars down to half a buck when they still cost over a dollar to make before you know it youve got seventy percent of the american market youre selling at a loss dumping exactly cause at this stage you dont care beans about profit what youre going for is the big fish market share henderson lit yet another dunhill and sure enough when it comes to the next generation the k memory chip youve got ninety percent of the action in very short order most of your american competition folds you ate them matter of fact intel which started it all dropped out of ram chips altogetherwhich is kind of like xerox throwing in the towel on copiers this is less than a decade after mitis startup in an industry born in the usa hi ho silicon away but it cost a bundle short term sure but now the futures wide open you live happily ever after my friend just like in fairyland because big bad americas dead and gone in the high volume end of semiconductors but miti cant use dumping as a regular strategy after all it is illegal well now aint that a fact he exhaled a lungful of smoke and coughed sos selling your ass but just take yourself a cruise down eleventh avenue and youll meet up with a lot of entrepreneurial ladies who understand the reality of market forces youve gotta get caught tried convicted if it ever does get that far the most thats gonna happen is a fine a lot of folks claim mitis dumped tvs cars steel textiles you name it so when they decided to move on memory chips asano was given a free hand to do it the quickest way he knew how and your buddy noda aint exactly a pussycat either the way he laundered the japanese taxpayers money into them lowinterest manana loans as he returned to his scotch i sat there trying to think what henderson had just described was a fundamental insight into how hightech industries operate henderson do you realize what youre saying thats a beautiful way to knock out a countrys hightech research capability take away the volume end of an operation and there goes your cash pretty soon you cant afford to finance any more r ampd which means that sooner or later youre selling yesterdays news you can kiss goodbye to your technological edge right across the board correct americas semiconductor boys were figuring to use the profits from memory chips to pay for research in logic chips where you put a whole computers wiring on a chip but now the moneys gone what it really means is end of ball game in information processing maybe it wont happen tomorrow but theres no doubt its just a matter of time you dominate semiconductors sooner or later youre just naturally gonna control computer technology and all that goes with it i even met a guy a while back who claimed that whoevers ahead in computers is eventually going to have the sayso about who has advanced weapons technology could be i thought but that last extrapolation was a stretch bill i think youre talking a pretty long line of dominoes for one thing weve still got plenty of computer research here the us has a big lead in logic chips true true who the hell can crystalball this one all i know is intel was claiming exactly the same thing about memory chips a few years back just before asano and noda and their pals chewed them up and spit them out all im saying is youd better watch your backside he examined his drink and reached for the ice bucket about that time ben came lumbering up the stairs to observe our maudlin ruminations i watched as he settled himself near my feet with a grunt then plopped his chin down on his paws well your fairy tale about miti may or may not be true but thats water over the dam besides who are we to be pointing a finger the us has done its share of tinkering with foreign governments making the world safe for american shareholders hey i make a profession of separating pious pronouncements from reality i never take an official story at face value okay so noda says hes just playing the market but if hes actually planning something else then what is it dont have the foggiest wish i did he glanced at his watch but i do know dutys about to call id better get uptown if i expect to have any female companionship for the apocalypse take it easy nobody flies on schedule anymore i settled back into my chair and glanced up at the large japanese screen i had mounted on the wall opposite it was momoyama around the time when the most recent crowd of shoguns took over japan against a gilded background was a fierce eagle perched menacingly on a pine branch the thing was so powerful i just kept the rest of the room bare nothing else i owned could stand up to it you know henderson the trouble with your pattern is that it doesnt quite fit this time shorting treasury futures is not exactly going after an industry so whats the new angle damned good question he stared at his glass probably wondering if one more for the road would impair his performance later on i guess he concluded yes because he didnt budge speaking of angles what do you make of that sword business last week caused one hell of a flap in japan so i hear major event that sword should tell us a lot about early japanese metal technology ive been trying to find out more about it but nobodys talking no pictures anything i reached over and gave ben a pat curious though i think i remember nodas mentioning that sword the night i met him eight hundred years ago the emperor gets caught at sea and loses the imperial symbol but he didnt breathe a word about having a project underway to locate it well youre my japan expert whats it all about never assume you understand the japanese mind i pointed up at the wall take a good look at the eagle on that screen youd think its just a picture but actually its an important subliminal message the daimyo who commissioned this piece had that eagle put on it to let everybody know he was cock of the walk means you cross him and youre dead symbols are important in japan noda and this woman mori talked a lot about shoguns and emperors maybe they hope the sword will somehow bring back the good old days well hes got enough money to do it looks that way hope were not about to get kamikazes with a checkbook thoughts like that could make a man real nervous henderson rose and strolled to the fireplace he examined his reflection in the large mirror over the fireplace then set down his glass on the mantelpiece and turned back you know walton i think im starting to lose my touch i dont believe anything i hear and only half of what i see he sighed been one hell of a day pretty standard friday far as i could tell well a damned strange thing happened this afternoon some woman turn you down maybe you ought to start working out henderson trim that little spare tire creeping in around the waistline still no complaints in that department friend no this actually goes back a ways to a few months ago down in washington when i bumped into a longhaired professor coming out of a committee session guy i mentioned a minute ago the linkup between computers and weapons him we got to bsing in the mens room and it turned out he was some computer hotshot from stanford hed been testifying i think and he was still wound up probably i got to hear all the stuff hed prepared and nobodyd asked what was the pitch defense semiconductor dependency claimed that if we keep on the way were going relying more and more on foreigners for advanced chip technology we may as well kiss the farm goodbye i had a little time to kill so i invited him to have a drink he good as chewed my ear off finally had to fake a dinner date to get loose man had a bug six feet up his ass about the us buying half the latest chips for our hotdog military hardware from japan next war we fight says he well be buying hightech weapons systems from the far east problem with that is anybody else could buy them too and wed get replacement parts whenever miti feels like getting around to it today i happened to remember him so i decided to give him a call ask him if he still saw things the same wav and no answer at his office but since i had his home number i decided to give that a try best i can tell a lot of academics goof off half the time anyway you get him some police detective answered wanting to know who i was what the hell i wanted whole nine yards shook me up dont mind telling you so whatd your pal do rob a bank i was about to start wondering finally though i got to ask some questions of my own but it was a little hard to swallow the story what i mean is i dont necessarily buy what i heard which was well seems he was supposed to meet with the senates internal security committee this morning wife says she put him on the redeye to washington last night around ten he was carrying some document he said he wanted to hand deliver something about it had him scared shitless henderson paused tell you this is the kind of guy who takes security seriously when hes worried we all better be worried so whats the problem cop claimed hes just disappeared not a trace chapter seven ken looked terrific that was tams first thought when he walked through the highsecurity inner doors to greet her he was square shouldered and sturdy with high full cheeks expensively trimmed dark hair and a small delicate mouth she figured him for late forties early fifties funny but hed always reminded her of one of those steely eyed expensively dressed actors you saw playing executives on the japanese soaps tamara he paused abruptly then bowed ikaga desu ka okagesama de genki desu anata wa doing well thanks you never cease to amaze me what a marvelous surprise a smile attempted to break through his dark eyes youve surfaced again just like the sword shed forgotten how colloquial his english was then she recalled hed told her once about doing his doctorate at mit possibly because of that he could be either japanese or western chameleonlike as the backdrop required he was every bit the charmer she remembered from kyoto one thing was different though kenji asano was ill at ease he was trying to mask it but it was there and that was very different from the old days as they passed the usual pleasantries he led her down a hall then through a room where intense young men in open shirts were now opening a case of asahi beer computer terminals were in neat rows along the walls beneath gleaming white blackboards that sparkled with equations and quips the place was so informal so american there were plenty of jeans and frazzled sneakers among the forty or so young researchers most of them in their late twenties or early thirties plastered across the low partitions were film posters and american counterculture bumper stickers radio already stolen nuke a commie for christ above a row of printers a blond pinup was unveiling her gynecological mysteries to the movie still of a startled godzilla and a couple of rusty california vanity plates were hanging over one longhaired staffers terminal like biggame trophiesone read kst the other ez bks probably commissioned by venture capitalists in silicon valley whose porsches had since been repossessed she thought the rock and roll dissonance of siouxsie amp the banshees sounded from a tiny stereo assembled out of computer hardware and a new yamaha digital tape deck presumably as a stunt the high end of the audio was being used to drive a garishly tinted computer graphics display that had been projected against one of the windows creating a virtual image that seemed to dance amidst the tokyo skyscrapers like a martian son et lumiere but she wasnt fooled by the frathouse trimmings she realized these casually dressed young researchers were the pick of japans technical graduates making the fifth generation team these days was one of the highest honors in the land after some initial skepticism the big corporations were now competing for the prestige of loaning their young stars to the project for a few years since they hoped to reap enormous benefits down the road in fact the youthful atmosphere was entirely intentional that she knew had been the legacy of kens predecessor dr yoshida who had refused to let anyone over thirtyfive on the project furthermore since he believed the stuffedshirt layout of most japanese offices and labs stifled creativity he had deliberately devised an unjapanese workspace to try and reproduce western research environments finally they reached a closed door metal when she realized it was kens office she almost remarked on this departure from what she remembered about dr yoshidas wellknown attitude he liked to be out on the floor with just another low partition right there interacting with his young staffers without a word ken inserted a magnetic card into the slot beside the door handle and then pushed it open not only a door she thought a locked door are they finally starting to worry about industrial espionage she wasnt surprised however to see that his office had a monastic spareness with only his desk a small but expensive leather couch and a row of computer terminals along one wall he was she knew a big believer in zen philosophy maybe pan of the reason for the door was just to shut all the madness outside and keep his own world serene through the window behind him she could see mt fuji outlined against a backdrop of autumn blue he smiled and pointed it out saying they were lucky to have a rare smogless day then gestured her toward the couch welcome to my refuge he was cordial but entirely correctright down to his conservative charcoal gray suit not a glimmer of a hint about their brief kyoto episode let me have tea sent in he leaned forward in his leather chair and punched the intercom on his desk ken please dont make a fuss i know i hate it when people just drop by she glanced back at the locked door wondering tell me if this is not a good time for you tam for you any time is a good time he buzzed again there had been no responsethen shrugged i guess things are getting hectic out front just now he laughed resignedly then turned to her by the way i saw your new book fine piece of work i do hope somebody over there reads it are you still running your center at nyu so far she decided to spare him the details well its a good school getting better all the time youve got some firstrate supercomputer work at the courant institute particularly with your ibm connection but you should keep an eye on columbia now that at ampt has joined with them to go after some of the pentagons ai contracts they may finally start putting together a major computer science department up there too in a few years stanford and carnegiemellon will have to step lively to stay out front hello she thought how come ken suddenly knows so much scuttlebutt about us computer research nobody at home knows the first thing about whats going on in japan i was surprised to hear about this new appointment ken she settled back on the couch i was guessing you had the inside track for miti vice minister in a few years ah well for now my work is here he gestured uncomfortably about the room let me try once more for that tea she realized hed slipped deftly around her quick probe concerning mitis new role in the lab he knew how to be a team player she thought very japanese this time he raised a response a female voice dripping with longvowel honorifics announced his tea would be delivered immediately next came a small awkward lull as they both sat there remembering kyoto and not sure how to get around that memory she wondered if it was happening all over again maybe it hadnt been just a fluke a crazy onenight diversion she was about to switch to japanese thinking that might provide the jolt needed to break the ice but just as the silence swelled between them there came a knock on the door and tea she was half annoyed half relieved he rose to walk over and began chatting as though theyd been interrupted in the midst of some intense technical exchange are you scheduled to present a paper at that kyoto conference coming up he pushed a button beside the door and it swung wide theres sure to be quite a crowd everybody heres excited about supercomputers these days no this is strictly a pleasure trip with maybe a few interviews thrown in to make it a tax writeoff for a book im planning on robots she hesitated though i actually might go down and try to see a few people then this could turn out to be a pleasant coincidence he took the tea and the bowing girl vanished again the door clicked shut i have to go too but im hoping to steal a few moments of freedom youre chairing a session this year absolutely not he turned serious im not allowed time for anything like that anymore tam this new project is top priority he poured her a cup of the pale green liquid and passed it over seemingly relieved that the tension had abated theres a lot of work here at the fifth generation lab now that were coordinating this program with the supercomputer effort you mean with mltls supercomputer project caught your little slip she told herself you are still with miti which means they have taken over this lab he didnt blink as you probably know miti has the goal of creating a machine capable of a hundred billion computations a second targeted just down the road which means we have to come up with entirely new computer languages and architecture parallel processing exactly handling multiple streams of information at once now that we finally understand whats required for a superfast computer this work in ai just happens to be very relevant it turns out we humans are already walking around with parallel processing in our heads able to handle words images ideas all at the same time so if we want to create machines that operate as fast as possible then its crucial to understand how our brain manages things like recognition learning inference our hope is that by utilizing the studies here in those areas incorporating them into our supercomputer work we might be able to put ourselves a major step ahead good god tam thought its elegantly simple thats why miti has taken over the fifth generation project theyre going to use this research in artificial intelligence to come up with a computer more powerful than anything the world has yet imagined their silicon monsters are about to start replicating themselves getting smarter as they go like in some bad fifties horror flick the difference is this isnt makebelieve so youre here on behalf of miti he paused for coordination as i said miti needs the fifth generation work to be accelerated he still hadnt exactly answered the question as part of our supercomputer effort tam knew that hitachi and nec were both already claiming they had the worlds most powerful machines faster even than crays entry the best american computer what did miti want he continued with megabit chip production already going strong and megabit commercialization in the wings it did seem the right time to pull all our work together if you think about it computer speed and computer intelligence go hand in hand ill show you in a second what i mean not kilobit megabit miti was going for the kill this was a crash program why does this mean you plan to increase your funding for the fifth generation effort whatever it takes to do the job he replied after a moments hesitation i suppose theres never enough money is there ken why the rush this sudden drive it depends on whom you ask he leaned back and looked at the ceiling some call it survival tamara maybe it is that simple japan is at a crossroads were rapidly losing our edge in the cost of labor the only possible way to counter that is to step up our use of smart machines well it looks as if i came to the right place id like to add your name to my interview list his look darkened a moment strictly off the record then he smiled and only if we can do it over dinner that sounds like a bribe call it an offering from an old admirer he smiled attempting to ease the tension the most i can do for now at least is just give you a small peek at a few of our experimental gadgets details are strictly proprietary at the moment were concentrating on computer vision and voice access and on that last by the way i think weve just about reached ais holy grail natural language comprehension good luck that was one of the mythical dreams of ai research a computer that could understand the speech of anybody who happened along even though millions had been invested in the us nobody was anywhere close yet i think were getting there enough so in fact that were starting to look at applications expect commercialization in oh say a year two at most look out ibm she found herself thinking i probably shouldnt be showing you this tamara so lets just keep this informal no notes but here have a look at one of mitis new toys can you guess what this is he passed over a small device that had been sitting on his desk his hand lingering on hers a moment longer than absolutely necessary she stared down at what appeared to be some kind of calculatorwatch except there was no watch face merely a small speaker and two buttons that uses advanced versions of mitis new megabit memory chips theres nothing like it anywhere in the world without ever having heard the speakers voice before no calibration it can translate ordinary spoken english into japanese he pointed to one of the buttons just press there and talk when you finish push the other button for the translation she did testing it with the opening paragraph of pride and prejudice her favorite novel a simulated voice emerged from the small speaker on the face of the device and gave it back in flawless japanese not bad she set it carefully onto the desk the thing was actually almost frightening using this linked to our new highdefinition video and satellite you could punch a button in your living room and bring up people on a wallsize screen from anywhere in the world then talk to them in your language and be understood in theirs its a quantum advance over current technology he retrieved the device dropping it into a desk drawer i must admit im very impressed truthfully so am i wheres this program of mitis taking us he looked up but let me show you something else which i think is even more astonishing of course youre aware that speech comprehension is easy compared to the really tough nut duplicating the human eye since a visual image can contain billions of pieces of information it can be very timeconsuming for a computer to analyze all those at once and figure out what its looking at ive heard people at ibm claim that for a computer to recognize something even as simple as an oddshaped coffee cup would still require almost an hour of processing that to match the human eye and brain could take a computer the size of a building but watch he walked over to a black metal installation attached to the wall and held up three fingers before its small lens then he pushed a button and spoke into a builtin microphone what do you see she started to reply herself then realized he was talking to the lens this time the answer took about ten seconds finally a voice in passable simulation of the tokyo dialect emerged from a gray speaker beneath the lens that is a human hand how many fingers does this hand have he continued again the eerie disembodied voice the normal human hand has five fingers this appears to have only three thank you he punched a button and turned back that came off the mainframe here can you imagine the amount of memory and logic processing required to achieve what youve just witnessed the data base and the computational power and speed not to mention the recognition of my voice commands how does it do it he paused tam this is proprietary top secret but what youve just witnessed is an example of parallel processing with mitis new still classified megabit dynamic rams a quarter of a billion bits of data on a chip she just stared are they writable of course he again settled himself behind his desk the test versions have circuits only a hundred or so atoms wide and this is only the beginning within five years maybe no more than three miti fully expects to have a desktop machine that will pass the turing test three years it was almost unbelievable passing the turing test meant the computers thoughts and speech would be so lifelike youd be able to talk with it and not realize it wasnt human als endoftherainbow as you can see the project is getting close he looked pensive like some zen monk strictly off the recordand i mean thatwhat miti is working toward is total automation factories run by machines with human skills intelligence manual dexterity in fact several of the robotics labs at tsukuba science city already have prototypes in advanced stages of development she was stunned this was the kind of futuristic talk you heard from all the ai buffs but it was still mostly speculation in the us and europe japan though was taking it straight to commercialization why are you telling me all this he sat silent for a moment then he looked at her because its time the world understood something very important about this country there are people here with an agenda and resources what do you mean tam there are people important people who are getting fed up know what theyre saying try this our country has a monarchy older than rome a heritage of literature art aesthetics equal to anything in the west weve never had any colonies any raw materials besides air and water all we do have is a willingness to work and savethe one natural resource running short in the west in less than half a century weve risen from the most total devastation any country has ever experienced and achieved technological parity with both the us and the soviets we launch satellites split atoms splice genes but still a lot of foreigners claim all this country can do is copy from the west steal and commercialize other nations inventions only a short time back the leader of france called our prime minister a transistor salesman thats right a transistor salesman ken that stupid crack was by de gaulle years ago its tam look around you this is an old country and a lot of influential people have long memories youre getting melodramatic he shifted in his chair and studied the white peak of fuji think so dont delude yourself believe me the west is about to dig its own grave what are you trying to tell me nothing you cant see with your own eyes he turned back miti is now ready to move into the next phase finally heres a project thats as strategic in its own way as the bomb if japan can succeed in creating a machine capable of humanlike thinking it will be the most profound achievement in the history of mankind and this project is well on its way there may be nothing that can stop the events that lie ahead stop what what events thats not a simple question he caught himself and eased up smiling uncomfortably once again forgive me none of this is for publication he hesitated your work is wellknown here in japan tam you are one of the few americans our industrialists respect unreservedly maybe you werent aware of that your books are highly regarded in fact i read the new one in manuscript a long pause then would you ever consider working with me for a while come back home so to speak you can see the implications of this project i see the implications all right she didnt know what to say why a sudden job offer from ken or was it from miti but where is this headed if japan achieves this technological supremacy what then before the flowers bloom miti must tend the garden he rose and poured more tea into her cup but enough you know ive thought about you a lot tell me how youve been whatve you been doing teaching writing you know everything and nothing he smiled then brushed an imaginary fleck of lint off his tailored woolen cuff well perhaps well have some time to talk what was he driving at was there more something going on he didnt want to broach here in the lab tam it is so good to see you once more he looked up again would you be interested in going down to kyoto with me day after tomorrow there are some things he sipped at his tea as i said im scheduled to look in on the conference and see a few people but i should have some free time that conference doesnt start till next week actually i need to be down a few days early oh why he measured his words oddly enough it has to do with the sword things have started moving pretty fast since those archeologists working for dai nippon recovered the sacred swordof the emperor antoku i saw the emperor on tv try going outside now well i think ill close here a little early and let my people go on home it sounds like their celebration has already started anyway he gestured toward the music and noise filtering through the door but the reason i need to be in kyoto a few days in advance is to see the president of dai nippon the firm that thats right his name is matsuo noda ive known him for some years actually he contacted me a couple of days ago about a meeting im not sure what he has in mind precisely but i have to find out hes just become one of the most influential people in the country not that he wasnt already and now with all the money hes about to have in this new imperial fund the one mentioned at the emperors news conference exactly as you might suspect that was merely the formal announcement some of us at miti heard about it several days ago my private hunch is that in a few days matsuo noda could well have more resources at his fingertips than any one man in the history of the world he looked at her its almost frightening when you think of the power hell soon have ken i think i would like to come along with you what was going on mitis plans already were pretty astonishing and now this new national hero the president of dai nippon was about to get involved more than that shed half forgotten how interesting kenji asano really could be her trip was taking a lot of unexpected turns well then in that famous american phrase why not he smiled the mask firmly back in place in fact ill try and arrange for you to meet matsuo noda while were there a conspiratorial wink maybe hell even give us a glimpse of the sword tokyo was one big party that night the streets mobbed they eventually found themselves in shinjuku in a hightech new restaurant all chrome and glass and new age prices the tuna sashimi seemed only minutes from the sea and the aged sake was smooth as a flawless white bordeaux afterward they grabbed a taxi over to the ginza where ken got seats on the tatami straw mats down in the orchestra of the kabukiza and they took in the last act of a kabuki play featuring the famous ennosuke iii that had been underway since late afternoon the evening ended up in the art deco mezzanine bar at the imperial the part salvaged from the old frank lloyd wright structure where she kicked off her shoes ordered a twentydollar cognac and nestled against his elegant shoulder what was that hed said about coming back home her books being circulated here even in manuscript what was he hinting at finally around two am he called for the check and neither said a word as they headed for the elevator she thought one last time about allans warning as she watched the floors flash above the door and searched for her key but this was no time to brood about conspiracies ken made her feel good which was a hell of a lot more than dave mason had done besides ken had some style all dave did was mope around in a pair of baggy chinos and whine about his department ken was upbeat alive aware whats more she enjoyed being with him feeling the heat of his cheek against hers as the elevator doors opened he slipped an arm about her waist and nuzzled her hair then their lips met he was just as she remembered his touch his taste his body still something about him was definitely changed then he reached for her key and opened the door the minute they entered the sitting room of her suite he took her in his arms tam lets not talk anymore about business no more swords im already bored hearing about it just us what do you say agreed she looked at him and suddenly realized something ken asano was beautiful kirei not handsome beautiful anata wa kirei desu kenji asano want a nightcap theres some airport remy in my who could even think about another cognac i just want to think about us he stood back all right maybe if you insist for old times sake old times is right ken its been a very long time since kyoto she located the dark remy bottle still packed in her leather flight bag a nice inauguration she told herself what was that all about was it real or did i just imagine it all the heart never lies he settled on the couch do you really remember vividly she laughed as she poured an inch into each of two thin hotel tumblers including that dreadful bar you took us all to a glimpse of the real japan tam for our tourist friends show them its not all ikebana and haiku believe me its not he clicked her glass do try to forgive me and heres to us to us and to the slightly scary world were stumbling into japan needs you here he pulled her next to him and brushed her cheek lightly with his fingertips then he kissed her deeply on the mouth and again need you here tam somebody like you theres well theres a lot we could do together she reached up and loosened his tie then began unbuttoning his shirt his chest was firm smooth scented she wanted him lets just remember kyoto for a while ive never forgotten it sometime around four am more content than she had been in a long long time tam richardson lay awake on the cool sheets kens trim body beside her and wondered how it would end this time around or possibly just possibly it wouldnt chapter eight back in new york optimism was in increasingly short supply what do you do if you think youre being set up one thing you may have occasion to muse long and hard about the consequences personal and otherwise you also may choose to ponder the larger motives of the individual behind it all so far what had happened matsuo noda had hired matt walton corporate attorneyatlaw to begin shorting the american treasury market then proceeded to make himself a bona fide hero back home in the process of which he acquired access to the biggest chunk of savings in the world presumably the financial arrangements he once alluded to using that money as margin noda was ready to shift his play into high gear my latest telexed instructions indicated he was poised to accelerate dramatically borrowing bonds and selling them for whatever the market would pay of course if the price went down anytime soon he could then replace those borrowed instruments at some fraction of what hed sold them for the man was gambling for godsake with the emperors fund or was he therein as somebody once said lies the rub short selling has always been a reasonably good definition of gambling except except you are gambling only if you are wagering money on an event whose outcome is not precisely known if you do know it you are not gambling you are taking prudent steps that will allow you to benefit from prior knowledge of said etc enough airy semantics the big question why me now ive been set up a few times before in my life everybody has i even wonder in darker moments if the reason joanna demanded a champagne lifestyle wasnt to make sure i spent all my time supporting it thereby rendering me exactly what she eventually accused me of beingan absentee husband and father that is a nowin situation the undertaking at hand however could have a very obvious beneficiary matsuo noda the only problem was that in order for noda to win america had to lose massively the old zerosum game for every winner there has to be an equal and opposite sucker after that friday evening with henderson i spent the next week mulling over the complexities of the situation the whole thing boiled down to two very strong presumptions one i was indeed being set up being told one scenario while the truth lay in quite another direction and two my employer had something very lethal to americas financial health up his sleeve still these were merely presumptions nothing more the only thing i was sure about was that i had a very unpredictable tiger by its posterior handle time to find out a little more about my pussycat i hadnt actually seen dai nippons midtown office but i talked to the manager almost every day on the phone and he occasionally shipped materials down to my place in the village i knew theyd taken over the building installed a new security staff moved into the vacant floor and were doing something however i hadnt been invited up to see what the something was i concluded the time was at hand as i understood it dai nippons purpose in life was to oversee the use of investment capital fair and good as it happens japanese business tends to be funded a little differently from our own instead of selling off stock to the public japanese industry relies much more heavily on bank financing in fact less than twenty percent of japans industrial assets are publicly traded consequently the rules of the game are changed if your company is beholden to a financial institution instead of a lot of nervous stockholders and fund managers youre in partners with somebody less interested in next quarters profits than in the larger matter of your still being around ten years hence to pay off its paper that lender naturally rides herd very closely on your longterm planning as best i could tell dni was one of the herdriders a sort of hired gun that monitored various companies operations to make sure they were managing their loans prudently again since the prospectus emphasized they were specialists in overseas investment i assumed that maybe part of the reason they were coming to the us was to oversee the japanese companies doing business here with money borrowed from back home nobody had actually told me this in fact nobody had told me anything that was merely what i considered to be an educated guess it was the only thing i could think of that made the slightest sense the following monday morning i told myself the guesswork was over it was high time i went up and saw for myself what they were doing all i needed was an excuse then the phone rang i was in the garden out back skimming the times and working on a pot of fresh coffee while waiting for the chicago exchanges to open ben was cruising the fence line sniffing for cats when i picked up the receiver waiting at the other end was mr yasuhiro tanaka office manager for the new york operation he chatted a bit about the weather how nice it was to be working in the us the usual finally he mentioned that he needed to meet with me to discuss among other matters certain legal questions concerning one of the other leases in their building would it be convenient if he came down to my place and we went over the paperwork not necessary i replied i just happened to be headed for midtown in the next few minutes id throw a copy of the leases into my briefcase and drop by to see him then before he could protest i mumbled something about the doorbell and hung up the phone rang again immediately but i didnt answer it i was already putting on my jacket i scribbled a few notes for emma taped them to her word processor and headed out the door minutes later i was in their third avenue lobby greeting the new security staff several of whom as a favor to tanaka id interviewed for their jobs then i took the elevator up to dnis offices on the eleventh floor and proceeded to have my argyle socks blown away first off top security the entryway just off the elevator bank had been completely transformed tv intercom steel doorsit could have been the vault at chase i told the cameras eye who i was and then waited while a computer somewhere gave me a voiceid check how they managed to have me in the system already i wasnt exactly sure maybe theyd taken it off the phone after id cleared that the doors slid open and i entered the first chamber of a tworoom security check an electronic voice ordered me to put my briefcase into the xray machine while i proceeded through the metal detector that cleared the set of steel panels leading into the next room slid open and i went in to be confronted by two crewcut guards who could have been retired sumo wrestlers as the doors clicked behind me i took one look at dnis welcoming committee and realized they were packing uzis those israeli automatics that could probably cut down a tree in about two seconds no candyasss for dai nippon without ceremony they commenced a body search it was all very polite but it sure as hell wasnt perfunctory i just stood there in astonishment while this gorilla roughly twice my size felt me up that indignity completed i was now in line for the real surprise yet another set of steel doors opened and there awaited the man id been dealing with over the phone yasuhiro tanaka medium build late forties cropped hair automatic smilehe was nodas chief of operations for new york he didnt say much just led me onto the floor heading for his office but he was clearly the onsite daimyd lots of heavy bowing from the young whiteshirted japanese staff as we headed for the corner suite which brings us to the real shocker dai nippons floor operation looked like the flight deck of the starship enterprise let me attempt a brief description in the far back was a massive nec augmented supercomputera half dozen offwhite octagonal units about head high one the mainframe and the others storage modules arranged alongside in a neat row pure power the whole thing was encased in a glassed room with i assumed critical temperature and humidity control then out on the floor were lines and lines of workstations computer screens everywhere printers running stacks of color hard copypie charts bar graphs spreadsplus terminals carrying every financial service offered by cable or satellite this was just the first fivesecond glance incredible i thought there must be a heck of a lot more japanese investment in the us than anybody realizes but something had to be wrong here why should finally i slowed downtanaka was hurrying me along clearly annoyed that id appeared uninvited thats when i noticed the rest across one wall was a line of projection tvs on which computer data was being scrolled as we walked past i noticed that each screen seemed to be under the scrutiny of a team of analysts who were intently studying the numbers comparing notes running calculations on their individual terminals whats this all about i stopped before one screen and studied it a second beneath it a small sign said simply electronics the one next to it read biotechnology then i glanced at a couple of others each one covered a different industrial sector gee i thought youre really out of touch walton who would have guessed japan has so much investment in manufacturing here i didnt remember much going on besides a few joint ventures sure theyve got a few auto assembly plants that steel plant theyd bought out on the coast some tvtube production chips vcrs but mostly it represented entries into sectors where theyre trying to get the jump on protectionism start a token manufacturing operation here before they get shut out if you have any questions im sure we can discuss them later tanaka had taken my arm and was urging me politely toward his office the whines and hums of laser printers and the beep of computers made conversation all but impossible well i was merely interested then i stopped know that test psychologists have the one where you look at a couple of silhouettes and describe what you see if you think youre supposed to look at the white part in the middle then you see one thingi think its a vase but if you concentrate on the black instead you see something else entirely maybe the profiles of two human faces opposite each other thus what you see is largely a product of your prior assumptions concerning what youre supposed to be looking for or maybe it measures whether you view the world as a positive or a negative image something like that i dont recall exactly i do remember receiving a b in psych which was generous the point is what i first thought i saw was actually the inverse of what was really there id told myself what it was rather than believing my eyes dai nippon was running analyses bet your ass but the industries under their silicon microscope werent japanese theyd computerized the financial report of every american company traded publicly and were now in the process of taking those outfits apart and i can assure you it was coldeyed in the extreme strictly hard numbers quarterly earnings longterm debt inventory stock outstanding ceo bonuses as any professional analyst would do theyd cut right through a companys glossedover excuses phrases such as strategic retrenchment aimed at the dividendnervous retirees in cedar rapids they were putting together the real story same with the financial markets screens were scrolling up tothesecond quotes on everything from threemonth tbills to thirtyyear treasury bonds computers were running arbitrage spreads on every issue they knew exactly where they stood with all their futures contracts i realized my little telephone boiler room had merely been the tip of some awesome iceberg mr walton it is a pleasure to meet you in person tanaka was ushering me into the corner office after our pass through the floor unlike most executive suites in new york its windows were sealed with heavy drapes again total security let me order tea he waved at somebody out on the floor i nodded still chewing over the setup and trying to understand what in good christ was underway im sure you are a busy man so perhaps we should proceed directly to my concerns as you may have guessed we are almost ready to move into a new phase of our operation oh i guess it must have sounded dumb but i honestly couldnt manage a full sentence finally i recovered slightly im a little surprised by the scope of all this whats the purpose our president nodasama should be arriving in a few days im sure he will be happy to address your questions in detail tanaka paused for the green tea delivered by a silent girlthe young smiling uniformed japanese office lady who scarcely looked up as she settled the tray on the desk after she was gone he continued this of course is only the financial nerve center for our operation our technical staff will begin arriving soon technical staff then who were those grimfaced minions out there punching computers youre bringing in more people correct which is why i needed to see you i understand that the lease on the floor above us is due for renewal at the end of this month we would like to acquire that space we will need to convert it as quickly as possible what about the current tenants there is a rider in their lease mr walton that permits the owner of the building to reclaim the space for his own use at the time of a renewal we fully intend to make use of it consequently as our american attorney you are hereby authorized to inform them that their lease will not be automatically extended that they will be expected to vacate in accordance with the legal and binding terms of their lease advise them also that there can be no grace period we will require the floor immediately i looked at him so much for the current tenants what will these new offices be used for tanaka sipped his tea that section will have another managing director our range of operations here brings other responsibilities what section what range of operations i am regrettably not at liberty to discuss the specific extent of dnis interests well let me break some news to you i like to know who im working for so youd better start discussing specifics and fast tanaka seemed to be having trouble meeting my eye the skull beneath his shortcropped hair glistened under the harsh neon lighting mr walton you are now part of the dni team that position includes obligations i am sure you would not wish to take lightly hold on the hell with politeness im not part of your team or anybodys i came on board with the explicit understanding that mr walton kindly sit down he pointed without ceremony to a chair i just looked at it then back at him as you are a scholar of japan he continued im sure you are aware that an employees loyalty to his company is considered to be a gauge of his character a company is a family and one considers its interests in that spirit maybe you didnt notice but im not japanese nihonjin as youd probably put it im a gaijin we usually work for number one at the moment mr walton you work for dai nippon there is an assigned role for you one that nodasan expects you to fulfill maybe i just handed in my resignation i do not really think you would wish to do that deadpan the confidence with which he made that statement told me this guy could make a killing at poker unless he had a few cards in the hole i didnt know about it would hardly be in your best interest we expect your contribution to be crucial what contribution that will become plain in due time mr walton he was measuring his words as he continued maybe easing up a bit for now let me merely say we know you to be a man with substantial curiosity consequently we believe that what lies ahead will be of considerable interest to you what was this samurai up to maybe its time everybody put their cards on the table and why dont we begin with you i thumbed at the floor outside what the hells going on out there at the moment nothing in this office need concern you but perhaps i can tell you this now that you are serving as our corporate attorney you are in a position to help us pursue other avenues i looked him over tanaka was beating about the bush why maybe it was merely the japanese style but he also seemed to know exactly what not to say im still waiting to hear whats next very well as long as youre here he sipped calmly from his cup it is common knowledge that japanese savers have become the worlds largest lenders with overseas investment that now exceeds by the way the greatest rate of lending by opec even at its peak the japanese people will have over a trillion dollars in overseas assets within the next few years im familiar with the numbers i also knew that with several trillion dollars in spare change sloshing around back home they were sending abroad a mere dribble of what they had were you also aware that over four fifths of our overseas investment is currently in dollardenominated instruments no surprise the dollars still the name of the game worldwide true enough but we at dai nippon are concerned that so many of our institutions have such heavy exposure in a single currency accordingly in addition to our program with interest rate futures we also feel it would be prudent to provide some protection for this currency risk in the same manner i might add that american investors often do you mean some downside protection on the dollar that is correct a devaluation or a sudden drop in exchange rates would jeopardize much japanese capital therefore we feel it would be prudent to enter the currencyfutures markets to cover at least some of the dollar exposure of our investors jesus i suddenly needed a valium in addition to treasuries now dai nippon was about to short the dollar presell it in advance of of what had noda been lying to me right down the line setting up a cockamamie cover with interest futures while all along he was setting up an international currency swindle or were we about to get down to the real action hed scheduled his curtain raiser whatever it was then realized he might accidentally pull the plug on the us greenback so hed decided to arrange a little currency insurance for everybody back at the ranch just in case dont ask me why but i was drawn to this pending nightmare like a moth to flame this was a ringside seat at all right who am i trying to kid that was the moment when i finally finally grasped what our meeting was all about it was to formally announce the tidal wave that would soon engulf america and now matsuo nodaor maybe i should say noahwas in his oblique japanese way handing me a pair of tickets good for one roundtrip passage on his ark the only thing missing was the schedule by then i didnt care whether i was on board or not i figured id just as soon try swimming on my own but i had one very good reason to play along okay whats the game want to sell some dollars for delivery down the road we assume you are familiar with the markets i stay in touch how would you like to go if you want currency futures therere the exchanges or you can buy forwards which are more or less the same thing from any number of banks around town futures only go out for a year maximum but i can probably get you forwards out to three come to think of it citibank will quote you tenyear forwards we would be looking at shorter terms no problem currency futures are quoted for march june september and december thats on the chicago mercantile exchanges imm but if three months are too far out then you can get options on spot currency contracts down at the philadelphia exchange which allows early exercise or if you want i think you can get offexchange bank quotes as short as one month citibank has a big forex desk and bankers trust and first boston or even banque indosuez of course if you really want to get serious theres the currency trading floor at barclays bank in london we expect to be active in all markets worldwide that seems best tanaka continued however we are only interested in december futures and onemonth contracts in the forwards after that we may choose to make other arrangements hang on america right and what are we talking here in terms of amount he handed me a sheet of paper it was like he was ordering up sandwiches from the deli corned beef on rye lean with extra mustard and a slice of pickle how many let me check oh say a few hundred billion this is going to take a few days i passed it back calmly as i could manage why dont you send a schedule down to my place late this afternoon my secretary will be there ill get started in the morning i rose in the meantime youll understand if i take today off and catch up a little on other work of course tanaka bowed head still glistening be in touch tomorrow i nodded farewell until then mr walton another bow as i turned to leave i walked back through the floor again trying to digest the spectacle this was undoubtedly the most comprehensive operation id ever witnessed what in hell did all this analysis of industrial sectors have to do with currency hedging not a lot of time to reflect on the question however since i was summarily being ushered toward the steel security doors by one of tanakas flunkies a young tough who seemed to speak no english but who could strongarm very eloquently in moments i was outside facing the bank of elevators that was when i remembered the upstairs tenant a big public relations outfit better take a couple of minutes and give them the word rausch mckinley and stein were in the middle of proving conclusively that our mayor knew nothing about contract kickbacks that he was in fact the closest equivalent new york had to driven snow his honor in the meantime was hastily returning the campaign contributions of all the real estate executives who flanked by their lawyers were now being featured on the front page of the daily news since rm amps had their hands full and also had expected an automatic renewal of their lease there werent too many politic smiles when i broke the news fact is it was a very unpleasant scene finally i called for their lease and showed them the rider theyd signed the damn thing not me sorry fellows all i can do is maybe drag this out a little for you mislay the paperwork or something have one of your attorneys give me a call off the record but id also advise you to start looking for space then i headed downtown a man with a mission dai nippon had to be getting ready to kick hell out of something or somebody trouble was i had no idea who or what but id had plenty of hints it wasnt going to do great things for the dollar i briefly toyed with alerting jack odonnell and telling him to leak some anonymous storm signals but what storm he wouldnt put his senate reputation on the line to peddle guesswork and all i had to offer was whatcircumstantial premonitions where to begin henderson was in london and unreachable meaning there was no chance of getting him and his less reputable washington connections to start shouting fire from the rooftops that left the press right what i needed was the media think somebody who if the whole thing proved to be smoke and mirrors could shrug it off but a comer who would be intrigued by the possible broadcasting coup of the century it had to be somebody with readymade exposure yet a personality with little to lose and a lot to gain that brought to mind the perfect candidate a former well acquaintance when i got home i went straight to the office upstairs looked up a number i hadnt used in a long time and dialed it it felt very familiar channel eight the freshest news in new york may we help you i always loved the way they peddled information as though it were wonder bread donna austen please one moment please there was a click then another voice channel eight news desk donna austen please whos calling please matthew walton tell her its business not personal enough pleases thank you mr walcan walton thank you on came the muzak would she do it she used to complain how fed up she was interviewing witnesses to car crashes her career needed a transfusion of hard news so the station management would start taking her seriously well here was her shot and since she was roughly tenth in line for the anchor spot she had no reputation of noticeable proportions to jeopardize by leaking an anonymous rumor the us was about to be shelled by an offshore battery of financial guns ms austen said to tell you shes in a meeting and cant be disturbed why is it some women cant just let bygones be bygones give me a break donna i was ready for anything except her little bedroom games how about advising ms austen im sorry i called at such an important time but i have some information that might just save her and everybody else from total ruin im very sorry but just tell her goddamit one moment no please this time another very long pause finally i heard donnas broadcastneutral diphthongs those lowerregister reverberations shed worked so long to perfect matt youve got your nerve this damned well better be quick sorry i yelled at the messenger im sorry about a lot of things but thats not the reason i called donna howd you like an exclusive the world as we know it is about to end inside a month matt have you been drinking no but thats not a bad idea well what is it you want a small favor you have got to be kidding not for me its the country im concerned about that includes you how about doing the us a favor and leak a heavy rumor from the world of high finance the american dollar dear to us all may be about to go the way of confederate mustard plasters ill even dictate the statement for you matt why dont you give this earthshaking scoop to one of your bigshot connections down at the wall street journal assuming its such hot news good question the answer sadly was that nobody inside the system would want to even hear this kind of talk let alone spread it everybody in the financial community was already whistling in the dark terrified those latin american debt dominos might start to tumble taking a few of our flagship banks along with them and now this no way donna i need somebody willing to go out on a limb you shit she gave a snort i let you mortify me once and believe me thats the last will you listen for chrissake i know it sounds crazy but this is dead serious ive taken on a foreign investment firm as a client i cant tell you the name but im absolutely sure the guy running it is about to screw this country somehow hes been shorting the bond market and now hes going to start dumping dollars billions and billions i want to blow the whistle get something on the air thatll cause a few bankers and traders to look up from their computer terminals and matthew darling how about your doing me a favor name it simple dont ever call me here again and while youre at it tell that asshole friend of yours bill henderson i think hes the biggest look im genuinely contrite about the scene he caused at your place if good click then the hum of a new york tel dial tone maybe she was right maybe i was seeing things in any case that aborted mondays attempted guerrilla war against matsuo noda now to man my barricades which moment coincided with the sound of emma epsteins key in the frontdoor lock the time obviously was exactly onethirty pm exactly i waited till shed settled in before taking the fatal step emma how about bringing me that file in your lefthand desk drawer the one marked trust account the blue one right amys you know it you updated the thing about a month ago when i switched all her money out of stocks and into moneymarket funds that move had been my one small attempt to ride nodas horse in the direction i suspected it was headed i remember she glanced at me disdainfully i also remember you predicted interest rates were about to go up which she was tactful enough not to add they hadnt she also didnt mention she had greeted my market prognosis with open skepticism as usual well for what its worth i still think rates are headed up soon and emma what she was grimly digging through the files ever think about some gold stocks for your retirement investments therere some mining issues i hear look good golden sceptre golaith vanderbilt thats amys portfolio you wanted correct she didnt miss a beat right she doted on amy and always got very testy whenever i dabbled in the management of my daughters little nest egg its galling to admit emmas market instincts did at times seem superior to mine john maynard keynes once said theres nothing so disastrous as a rational investment policy in an irrational world maybe he was right could be i was shackled by too much logical introspection never a problem for emma all i know is if her daughterinlaw in jersey phoned in on my line that shed just baked a terrific cherry pie using new improved crisco emma marched out and loaded up on procter amp gamble and the damn thing automatically went up ten points here it is she placed it on my desk with a decidedly disapproving sniff thanks dear lord i thought stand by us sinners now and at the hour of our death i went over it quickly with a hand calculator about ninetyfour thousand which i figured would pay for roughly a year and a half of college the way those already inflated costs were skyrocketing but by the time noda got finished with the dollar it probably wouldnt cover a weekend seminar maybe i couldnt save the us but i was damned well going to get my daughter through school with fear and trembling i started calling banks naturally i spread the action around town bsing a lot of currency traders and bank forex foreign exchange departments in the process id buy some pounds sterling then by the way long as were on the phone mort i think i might need a few million yen in oh say about a month why dont we just save time and write some contracts now besides bird in the hand you know then id take those pounds id just acquired and use them to buy several million deutschemark forwards from the next dealer i knew how much did i go out total remember currency forwards run around a penny on the dollar so i effectively sold something like ten million greenbacks deliverable in one month when i figured theyd be worth it was hard even to imagine most likely zilch since i was flying blind amys college fund bought everything you name it i went long she ended up owning futures on swiss francs german marks yen lira pounds sterling canadian dollars even french francs i was actually tempted briefly by the peso well she loved her trip to mexico last summer a sentimental gesture i sternly resisted by the time id finished it was four fortyfive meaning my new ninthgrade owner of a united nations basket of foreign currencies had just arrived home from her west side private school she always charged in at fourthirty i called joanna and asked to speak to my daughter jos response to the sound of my voice was only slightly less fulsome than donna austens finally amy appeared at my ear dad how come youre calling on the downstairs phone youre supposed to always use the one in my room mom hates it when sweetie that line is in constant and uninterrupted engagement between the hours of four thirtyone and eight fifteen its never possible to reach you there at this time okay so whats up nothing much how about if you and i caught up on things a bit what do you say to dinner tonight just the two of us we might even consider a real grownup meal for a change no alfalfa sprouts where she was immediately on guard what if she ended up confronted with a redtinged steak sliced off one of the living mammals of the earth anywhere someplace youve always wanted to go my treat wow anywhere your pick long pause then how about windows on the world sounds good i guessed one of her school friends had just been meaning prestige was on the line i was right sharons dad took her there last weekend for her birthday and it sounded really neat she said you can see everything its probably a lot nicer than top of the sixs where in case you hadnt guessed id taken her on her birthday foods standard but i think we can piece together a spread thatll meet your guidelines will your mother let you go joanna had total weekday custody and she played it for all it was worth shes got a big date tonight that creepy real estate guy i told you about the one with the new silver saab he thinks is so hot dont tell me about it and dont call your mothers friends creeps im sure theyre all very nice want to bet this guy is total weirdness but shell let me go no sweat what time when i was a youth i dont remember young ladies using phrases such as no sweat probably an imperfection of memory one of many pick you up at seventhirty sharp call me if theres a problem okay and amy yeah uh think about wearing an actual dress not one of those experimental east village daaad im gonna look so straight youll see never doubted it for an instant that night id intended to explain that her college fund was currently being hedged via a comparatively unorthodox investment scenario however she was too busy marveling over the lights of manhattan a hundred stories down to give me much time to talk what i really wanted to tell her but somehow didnt was that id had this spiritualist vision wed been reincarnated as a couple of those crazy sheiks at monte carlowhen im the guy who never ventures past the quarter slots next to the door it was as though id pillaged the hundred grand carefully hoarded for her future and spread it over a giant roulette play stacking chips on every number on the board who knew where dai nippons wheel would stop but when it did one of them had to pay off a hundred to one noda couldnt touch us right no sweat chapter nine tam was headed east in the black nissan limo listening to the talk and thinking seated alongside was kenji asano wearing a light tan suit and gold cufflinks while the space opposite was occupied by two individuals who made her very uneasy one was the instantly famous matsuo noda the other his niece talkshow economist akira mori noda was wearing a black threepiece bankers suit the perfect accompaniment to his silver hair and small wireless spectacles that magnified his penetrating eyes mori in designer beige looked as if shed just stepped from the nhk studios which in fact she had only a few hours earlier three days had passed since nodas imperial press conference four counting today with this sudden trip being only the latest in a series of unexpected events the major new twist getting her interviews rolling was turning out to be a lot harder than it should have been before leaving new york shed arranged for a day with dr noburu matsugami of the electrotechnical institute at tsukuba science city to go over the latest progress of mitis advanced robot technology project now the world leader the undisputed state of the art in robotics matsugami had even volunteered to supply introductions to the other miti labs at tsukuba everything was set except now it wasnt when she called friday to confirm their meeting dr matsugami advised her that some unexpected schedule conflicts had come up most apologetic perhaps they could try again week after next whats more that was her last call for the day because immediately afterward her hotel phone had gone dead for five hours management was strangely evasive about the problem when a temporary line was finally installed it had a curious whine that made conversation all but impossible my luck she thought japanese technology the best in the world breaks down on me consequently it was almost a relief to get out of town not the least of reasons being tokyo still had a hangover from all the sword celebrations its streets were strewn with debris and services remained haphazard as planned she and ken departed the next afternoon on the shinkansen bullet train first class where the porters wear white gloves and bow after making an announcement to the car the only way to travel finally some peace and quiet after the madness of tokyo shed told herself it felt like the concorde except with legroom she leaned back to watch as the white peak of mt fuji flashed by at a hundred and forty miles per hour and chatted with ken who was sitting next to her glancing through some miti memos hed brought along the trip down zipping through industrial nagoya had helped to settle her mind kyoto for her there was nowhere else quite like it in the world if you knew the byways it could be a universe away from the mania of tokyo time to lighten up at least she had no reason to suspect ken was giving her the runaround hed seemed genuinely disturbed when she told him about matsugamis polite refusal to talk didnt say much just frowned was strangely silent for a moment then declared hed make a few phone calls and check into it when there was time kenji asano she noticed seemed to have a split personality one for her and one for the rest of the world in public he was all japanese striding ahead and ostentatiously barking opinions but that she knew was merely for appearances hed have been the object of silent derision by elders if hed displayed the slightest consideration for his female companion she recalled that famous japanese proverb the man who falls in love with his wife merely spoils his mothers servant okay she told herself as she trailed along when in rome japanese men need to strut and bully their women in public its the only chance they get everybody knows the obedient little helpmate dutifully pacing behind garnishees his paycheck and doles back whatever she likes kens stern traditional public face however was merely one of his many personas alone with her he could be as western as any japanese man would permit himself for a japanese of course western doesnt mean all the gladhanding bonhomie of an american theres always an element of reserve just the same he was nothing like the typical sexless oblique japanese businessman he had a superb body taut and athletic which he knew better than to bury in some cheap offtherack japanese suit no polyester strictly silk and finest wool he had a sense of style the power look and he really was a widower whose wife had died in a freak auto crash soon after their marriage in short kenji asano was complex not easy to categorize the same went for matsuo noda as she and ken were coming down on the train a porter had come through the car announcing denwa a call for dr asano when he returned he reported that matsuo noda needed to make a quick trip down to the famous shinto shrine at ise tomorrow morning to review the site for the new museum dai nippon international would build to house the sword and wanted him to come along a good time to discuss their mutual interests he always seems to know everything that goes on ken smiled wistfully he also suggested that perhaps my visiting american colleague would like to make the trip too oh tam thought why me thats not the way japanese executives go about things women arent part of their highlevel conferences i dont understand this ken shed been half dozing but now she was coming awake very rapidly seems a little strange dont you think asano shrugged he just said hed like to meet you but why what did you tell him about me nothing really he glanced away curious she was fully alert now then how did he tam dont be naive matsuo noda knows who you are believe me he shot her an admiring glance why are you frowning its true he knows all about your work he practically demanded you come along he called youwhat was itthat brilliant american professor you know something about this doesnt add up she was having her first experience of matsuo nodas long arm and she found it unsettling why not tamara you of all people should know we japanese have a national tradition of honoring guests nodasan is old school through and through he leaned back besides hes bringing somebody else along to meet you could be very interesting who he told her so here they were in the dai nippon limo a stretch with acres of room and green tea that flowed till she thought she would burst what was that old line about the roomful of zaibatsu negotiators the one with the toughest bladder prevails seeing matsuo noda in person confirmed everything shed sensed about him on the tv he was a genius still something about him told you that when you sat down to cards with this man youd do well to cut the deck what really took her aback though was the woman alongside him akira mori could be it was just her style tam was definitely overwhelmed for the trip shed worn her softly tailored calvin klein suit her only one in shades of pale warm gray and set it off with some simple stark silver picked up on a trip to morocco perfect pitch she looked smashing feminine yet all business and ken had told her so at least three times all the same she wasnt prepared for moris ostentatious fashion statement when the dni limo appeared at their hotel the international japans favorite tv money guru was wearing one of her severe rei kawakubo ensembles a small ransom in gold accessories and enough makeup for a haute couture ramp model it turned out shed taped an early morning interview show at nhks tokyo studios for broadcast that night then come down directly on the shinkansen she greeted tam and ken with scarcely more than a frosty nod tam found this standoffish manner puzzling on the other hand it did fit perfectly with kens quick morning briefing on nodas famous niece quite a story according to him her father dr toshi noda had been a celebrated figure in years past an honors graduate of tokyo university hed been the star mathematics professor of kyoto university when he was summarily conscripted by prime minister tojo to take charge of wartime cryptography codes tojo wanted the best and he got it consequently mildmannered toshi noda had been one of the minds behind the famous purple machine used for japanese ciphers during the early part of the war eventually however the project became redundant after a time tojo ceased to trust the purple machine and decided to replace it with that famous nazi invention the enigma machine on that one ken had added with a touch of irony toshi noda was well vindicated the enigma machine code had already been cracked by the allies long before hitlerdeclaring it unbreakabledelivered it to tokyo toshi noda resembled his older brother matsuo physically but he differed radically in outlook being a devout buddhist and a pacifist after the stunning japanese bloodbath at saipan which demonstrated the war was clearly lost hed been one of those imprudent citizens whod spoken out publicly for peace not surprisingly he was immediately placed under surveillance by the kempei tai japans secret police and shortly thereafter jailed after three months internment he was released a broken man a week later he committed ritual seppuku disemboweling himself for the crime of having disgraced the family toshi nodas diaries published posthumously and read widely in japan revealed his deep repugnance for the wartime government he believed that prime minister tojo had become in effect a neoshogun although the shogunate supposedly had been abolished when emperor meiji took control and opened japan in toshi noda saw it restored with tojo another shogun who had come along and isolated the country once again nonetheless hed been a man of few words his death poem written only moments before he put the knife to his stomach was as simple and intense as his life darkness upon yamato land of the gods awaits the new dawn tennoheika that last was a traditional phrase that simply translated meant son of heaven for a japanese though the overtones are more they say the way of the emperor subsequent history proved him prescient on several pointsthe main one being that militarism was a disaster for japan also he had rightly feared that the monarchy would become an empty symbol in the ruins of tojos hopeless war although he hadnt lived to see tojo tried and hanged as a criminal he had predicted the outcome of the war unerringlyand hed insisted that his infant daughter be evacuated to sasayama just before the allies moved in for the kill because of his foresight she escaped the first firebombing of tokyo which converted the city into a giant death oven for eighty thousand innocent japanese civilians too old or young to escape americas pragmatic final solution auschwitz with airborne incendiaries the rest of toshi nodas family was burned alive afterward matsuo noda had complied with another of toshi nodas wishes and made certain his daughter received a firstclass education since she had a natural instinct for economics hed encouraged her rightly foreseeing it as a discipline vital to japan in the twentyfirst century she had excelled beyond his fondest expectations she was in fact brilliant as a result he grew to dote on her to an extent that eventually grew almost obsessive hed even made her his heir since he had none of his own his fortune was rumored to be in the tens of millions probably the most important thing to keep in mind about akira mori ken had concluded was that she merely looked avantgarde inside she lived in another age in fact he suspected the reason shed never married had something to do with the fact she was already wed to the vision of japans powerful sacred imperial past on the trip down to ise mori had silently sipped her green tea while noda chatted with asano about the costs and timing of commercializing the intelligent machines that would come out of the fifth generation project although noda stuck to generalities it was clear he was totally conversant with the latest developments in the field in fact tam found herself thinking he seemed to know anything there was to know about just about everything he displayed the same obsession with japans technological future that the oldtime shoguns must have had about the goingson of their vassals she also sensed that he and asano were doing a lot of their communicating in a verbal shorthand enough so that she began to suspect they had worked together before they were like father and son each anticipating the others thoughts and conclusions by the time they reached ise it was already late afternoon but nodas driver had phoned ahead from the car and arranged rooms for the night at the local spa so they wouldnt have to go back late she noticed there hadnt been any talk about the famous sword but she figured maybe he was saving that for dinner the museum noda planned was to be built outside the shrine proper just before you crossed the wide arched uji bridge spanning the isuzu river that separated shintos holy ground from the ordinary world the shrine itself a collection of thatchedroof buildings in severe traditional style was hidden down a long trail among giant cryptomeria trees that towered hundreds of feet into the pale afternoon sky attesting to the speed with which things can happen in japan when theres the goahead from above the location had already been staked and the trees cleared excavation for the foundation merely awaited nodas approval while everybody else stood around and waited he consulted with the site engineer checked over the plans and made a few final changes all the while onlookers were bowing to him right and left hed become overnight an authentic japanese legend after finishing with the engineer he suggested they stroll on down to pay respects at the shrine itself since theyd come all this way their burly chauffeur suddenly became a bodyguard clearing the path ahead noda was expansive now presumably confident his niche in history was secure as they were crossing the wooden bridge he casually asked tam what she knew about the sword a oneofakind historical find she replied important and fascinating shed seen the emperor on tv i assumed you would understand its significance he was leading the way down the path perhaps then youll indulge me a moment for an ancient tale about it by now the entire shrine had been cleared of tourists and they were surrounded only by bowing and smiling priests in white robes the vip treatment the imperial sword harkens back in a way to our version of adam and eve except according to our own creation story they were also the ones who created japan they were the original kami the original japanese gods well perhaps god is too strong a term dr richardson i prefer to think of our kami as merely spirits of life noda shrugged then continued according to the myth the first male and female kami stirred the sea with a long spear then lifted it and the brine that dropped from its tip piled up and became japan she caught herself smiling ive always wondered what freud would have thought of that mori glared at her in a way that suggested some offense at her irreverence while miteducated ken merely stifled a grin noda however took the quip in stride freud ah yes your philosopher i seem to recall hes the one who regarded almost everything as some manifestation of our sexual appetite well these are primitive stories dr richardson that describe the beginning of life i suppose they should be somewhat earthy wouldnt you agree he chuckled nonetheless according to our early tales the sun goddesswhose shrine this iswas created out of the left eye the side of honor of the first male kami and the moon god was created out of his right then they ascended into the skies she glanced up the sun goddess appeared to be headed for bed the sky itself barely light through the cryptomeria the air was beginning to grow slightly crisp now we come to the sword when the sun goddess finally sent her grandson down to rule over the mortals below he brought with him the three items that became the emblems of imperial rule they were the sacred mirror signifying purity a curved bead necklace used to ward off evil spirits and the sword standing for courage the great grandson of that first earthbound immortal extended his dominion over all of japan and became the first emperor we are told his name was jimmu and the legends say that was around bc so desu miss mori interjected abruptly startling even ken she seemed to be lecturing directly to tam we all know our emperor today is directly descended from him in fact he is precisely the one hundred and twentyfourth emperor after jimmu japan and the imperial line were born simultaneously and every japanese is related to him we are a monoracial state tam glanced at her by god she wasnt kidding well its possible the traditional account has reworked historical facts a trifle noda continued smoothly actually the peoples who became our modern japanese seem to have made their way here to the main island from somewhere in the south pacific and settled in this area around ise near here we still find burial mounds that contain replicas of their early symbols of imperial authoritymirrors gems swords but the sword you found did it really come down from on high tam asked half hoping to rankle akira mori you mean was it that very first one noda shrugged who could locate the original garden of eden please we all must allow for a certain element of poetic license in our myths but it is unquestionably the sword referred to in the ancient chronicles such as the heite monogatari which dates from the heian era the ninth through twelfth centuries that sword was lost in and now its been recovered thats all we know for sure mori walking along in her quick japanesewoman pace obviously was not satisfied with nodas rationalist version of history dr richardson she cut in again what the recovery of the sword has achieved is to remind the japanese people that we are unique we japanese have a special soul a yamato minzoku of pure blood and spiritual unity all japanese are related to each other and to the emperor so there is a oneness of spirit a bloodandsoul relation between the emperor and his people yamatoists believe rightly that a temporary eclipse of our japanese minzoku was brought about by the american occupation whose imposed constitution and educational system were acts of racial revenge against japan our postwar identity crisis our negative image of ourselves was created by americans but that time is over although we have no single god as in the judeochristian tradition we have something even more powerful through our emperor we have a line of descent that harkens back to the beginning of our world perhaps we no longer choose to claim he is divine but that makes him no less an embodiment of japans special place akira mori tam suddenly realized was a closet yamatoist those new rightwing racist firebrands of modern japan time to give her a little heat surely nobody today seriously thinks the emperors forefather came down from the skies she turned back to noda you dont believe it do you he shrugged ours is a skeptical world dr richardson is your pope really infallible or did he acquire his right to be divine spokesman by winning a small election nonetheless popes and kings are like ancient tribal leaders despite all our modern democracy we still yearn for a figure to embody our identity for the japanese to have an emperor who if only in legend has blood kinship with the gods who created our homelandwhat could be more important about that time tam glanced up and realized they were passing under a large torii gate entryway to a place that seemingly had nothing to do with the real world just beyond were the shrines reminding her somewhat of a sanitized tropical village as imagined by hollywood each of the cypresswood buildings set above the ground on stilts was architecture at its most primal a study in simplicity their polished wood was untouched by a speck of paint while the footthick blanket of woven straw comprising their roofs had a creamy texture that looked like cheesecake there was nothing in the world to compare what really made them unique though was something else entirely although the shrines were merely straw and natural wood possessing none of the centuriesold authority of the cathedrals of europe in a curious way they were actually older for they had been rebuilt anew every twenty years since time immemorial suddenly the real significance of that struck her what other people had kept alive such a powerful symbol of their common heritage for centuries and centuries westerners had difficulty grasping the continuity this shrine represented little wonder noda could galvanize his clan with some powerful new reminder of who they were shinto wasnt a religion there were few rules and no payoff in the sky instead it was the mortar binding a race the main shrines over there he continued pointing to a collection of buildings in an area enclosed by a high wooden fence are off limits to all save the emperor himself and certain of the priests that ground is the sacred link between our emperor living now and those of times past even photographs are forbidden tam noticed that many of the gables of the buildings were tipped in gold burning amber when an occasional shaft of late sunlight reflected off them dusk was starting to settle in and the evening birds and crickets had begun to add their eerie sound effects she found herself deeply touched what was it about the place that inspired such reverence was it the serenity the purity yes this shinto holy of holies possessed a secret power the unassailable strength of nature it moved her how could it not somewhere inside she felt envy of them all felt a yearning to share their absolute sense of who they were while she reflected on that surrounded by the white gravel and golden woods she found herself looking anew at ken being here with him at ise made her question once again whether in his world his austere yet deeply passionate world she could never be anything but a gaijin an outsider chapter ten it was almost dark when they reached the spa one of those vast japanese resort hotels catering to the middle class it had a faketraditional exterior and hundreds of rooms inside as though the temple of the golden pavilion had somehow been hollowed out and enlarged to encompass a health club strangely though it had been completely cleared guests sent on their way it was totally absolutely empty the parking lot was cordoned off and gardeners were busily clipping and manicuring the grounds tam was impressed dai nippon must have plenty of clout she told herself to be able to commandeer an entire hotel the manager came out to meet noda deferentially bowing and sucking in his breath after which their few bags were summarily swept away when noda returned he said nothing merely smiled and suggested they all retire to the big public baths on the lower level since the hotel was a vacation retreat the basement was almost entirely devoted to the one universal love of the japanese publicscalding water down they went through the concrete hallways attendants and staff bobbing the saunalike baths like the hotel seemed to be theirs alone while noda and ken retired to the mens section down the corridor tam and mori entered the womens side a cavernous tilefloored room with a steaming pool at one end local women in white headkerchiefs immediately appeared and began to fuss over their guests scrubbing and rinsing them while praising the famous nodasama then as moris towel dropped away tam looked her over good figure she had always believed that judged by western standards japanese women tended to be somewhat flatchested and to have shortish calves characteristics the highwaisted kimono was well designed to disguisewhich also explained why a western woman wearing one could easily look like a buxom stork mori however had a lithe wellproportioned shape and her breasts were positively generous the intimacy of the bath didnt noticeably humanize her however while they soaked and steamed she volunteered nothing beyond a few routine pleasantries no more tirades about yamatoism and american treachery but no informal talk either after a polite interval tam excused herself to go upstairs to her room and freshen up for dinner moris agenda clearly differed from nodas this woman she concluded had a game plan all her own but what not long afterward she heard ken tapping lightly on the door just as shed hoped after the hot steamy bath he couldnt have been more welcome in fact she took one look at him pristine and elegant in his blue silk yukata and briefly considered undressing him right there in the doorwaywith her teeth he was a wonderful lover by turns gentle and forceful as though their being together was some exquisite ceremony their lovemaking always had a particularly japanese quality a heightened appreciation of the erotic derived no doubt from a tradition that values subtlety and sensual satisfaction afterward they shared a brief soak in the little redwood tub there in her room then he headed down the hall to change well she told herself coming down to ise has been well worth the trip matsuo noda is definitely eccentric but all the same hes a renaissance man by any gauge still why did he want to meet me just to tell me ancient fables no thats some kind of prelude the real theme is yet to be announced as she started putting her hair up in some quick curlers to try and recover from the steam she pushed aside her misgivings although she only had the suit shed worn down intended for business she decided it didnt matter surely tonight would be informal she was just finishing up with her hair when she heard a frantic pounding on the door very unjapanese puzzling she cracked it open ken was standing there no slippers still in his yukata which he hadnt bothered to tie all the color gone from his face behind him were two uniformed hotel maids bearing what was surely the most gorgeous kimono she had ever seen heavy silk with a handpainted landscape edged in gold brocade tamara i had no idea honestly nodasama only found out when we got here and he couldnt say anything it was all top secret heavy security they only just arrived a few minutes ago and hes asked noda to dine with him he paused for breath were invited too whos just arrived asano was so nonplussed he didnt hear her apparently he wanted to review the site plans personally tomorrow to see where the museum will be i hear the imperial household was set against it but he insisted who for gods sake the impossible answer was rapidly dawning abruptly he paused embarrassed by his own mental disarray his majesty tam were about to meet the emperor of japan in marched the bowing maids lots of longvowel honorificsthey apparently assumed the honorable richardsonsan must be americas first ladyand took over tam knew full well that donning a formal kimono was no small undertaking but shed forgotten what a major task it really could be first came the undergarments cotton vest and silk underkimono secured twice once with a cord and then with an undersash next was the kimono itself right side folded under the left and then bound at the waist with a cord the excess length being pulled up and folded over so that the hem just cleared the toes that fold was in turn secured by another waist cord after which came yet another undersash now it was ready for the allimportant outer sash the obi a heavy silk strip wound around the waist twice cinched hard and knotted at the back long end up short end down then the long end was folded into a sort of cloth origami this one a butterfly after which it was rolled into a makeshift tube into which the short end was stuffed finally this obi sculpture was secured with yet another waist cord knotted in front it was all done with minute precision including the rakish display of a prescribed few millimeters of silk under kimono at the neck an erotic touch for traditionalists finally she put on special tabi stockings bifurcated at the big toe to accommodate her thonged slippers then they attacked her hair brushing spraying adding ornaments the makeover took a good three quarters of an hour and even so it was a rush job as the sashes and cords and cinches got ever tighter and more suffocating she remembered what wearing a kimono can do to your psyche the obi seemed designed to demolish breasts the multiple waist sashes and cords to totally immobilize the torso from rib cage to thigh when ken finally escorted her onto the elevator she felt like a walking mummy this she remembered is why a lifelong kimono wearer minces along in short pigeontoed steps that suggest shes been shackled at the knees downstairs the kitchen had been placed on war footing and what awaited when they entered the tatami banquet room was the tableau for a fullscale feast the lacquer table was dotted with delicate ricestraw mats on which was marshaled an array of ancient stoneware plates and cupsrugged black raku creamy white shino greentipped oribe the kakemono picturescroll hanging in the tokonoma was a severe monochrome landscape in the angular ink style of the great master sesshu was it authentic she wondered whered they get it after a few minutes wait the stately man shed first seen on tv appeared in the doorway and began removing his shoes surprisingly relaxed and informal despite the household guards standing just outside for security while everybody bowed to the floor he greeted nodaapparently theyd met when noda presented the swordand exchanged a few pleasantries his speech was now ordinary japanese not the archaic court dialect of the news conference this was the real man noda bowed politely from time to time then turned and introduced his party the emperor of japan tam noticed seemed to have an eye for the ladies when her turn came he was all easy smiles saying something about how pleasant it was to meet such a charming american since he rarely had the honor he then complimented her kimono after that his majesty took the place of highest status his back to the tokonoma alcove traditionally the safest spot to be since it was the one location in a room sure to be backed by a solid wall and motioned for noda to sit next to him on the left the secondhighest place of honor then he nodded toward tam calling her his honorable foreign guest and asked if she would indulge him by sitting on his right she bowed back and took her place mori whose own kimono was a pattern of delicately shaded autumn leaves was seated alongside noda while ken was placed next to tam as he was settling everybody an important ritual of prestige the emperor kept repeating how delighted he was to meet a real americanhis exposure to the outside world these days apparently consisted mainly of television he started things off by toasting dai nippon international with a saucer of sake after which he asked noda to repeat for him again exactly how the sword had been recovered since his late father had been an ardent marine biologist he loved the part about the computerized magnetometer and pressed for all the details finally the banquet got underway course after course of a little sliver of local seafood and an ornamental portion of seasonal vegetable everything on some unexpected serving piece it was a feast of sight as much as taste a delicacy called mukozuke came in a black lacquer bowl hassun on a bamboo tray hashiarai in a brown raku cup konomono in a weathered earthen dish yakimono on a gray oribe platter tipped with green the sake pot was castiron sixteenthcentury with a pale turquoise porcelain top they all drank from saucers of crusty white shino warethe emperors tipped in gold by then tams legs had begun to ache she knew that sitting in formal japanese style on the heels can eventually induce what seems like semiparalysis of the lower extremities as she glanced around she decided that only ken whod told her he was accustomed to kneeling traditional style for hours practicing the tea ceremony actually seemed comfortable finally the table was cleared for the famous specialty of the spa which his majesty had specifically requested it was an ornate yosenabe a lusty japanese bouillabaisse of artfully sculptured components each of which signified some episode in the fateful battle of dannourain fact the very engagement in which the sword was lost that was eight hundred years ago tam reminded herself yet youd think it was only last week they were just concluding the meal with the traditional serving of gohan or rice when the manager of the spa entered and announced that their special entertainer was now ready he apologized that although he could offer nothing truly worthy of his majesty his humble spa had brought from kyoto a performer he hoped would not be judged too harshly he then ordered more sake sent in although drinking more sake after a banquets closing round of gohan is normally judged impolite his majesty just smiled and thanked their flustered host around went the small flagons once more maids scraping the tatami with their foreheads as they refilled the emperors goldtrimmed saucer then the fusuma parted and the evenings surprise swept into the room wearing an austere autumn kimono of finest silk and holding a shamisen a threestringed instrument with a catskin face and gold fittings her lips were vermilion her lacquered wig coalblack her face chalk as she bowed low before his majesty only one visage in the room was paler than hers she was ken whispered to tam with great delight none other than matsuo nodas former protegee koriko after she had bowed low before the emperor she greeted the president and ceo of dai nippon as though he were merely another guest he nodded and mumbled back a reply both curt and incomprehensible next she tossed a mildly flirtatious acknowledgment to ken who returned her wink and toasted her with his sake saucer that ended the formalities since she treated the women in the room as though they were composed of thin air their presence violated all tradition an embarrassment that could be papered over japanese style simply by pretending they didnt exist tam could have cared less while the pained face of akira mori indicated she was positively relieved koriko took immediate command of the room with an easy poise that confirmed her professionalism tam guessed she was pushing forty but knew that aficionados of geisha prefer talent over youth using a large ivory plectrum koriko strummed her shamisen twice its woundsilk strings piercing and whiny then began a highpitched song from her ancient repertoire tam couldnt follow the words and doubted if anybody else could either however she knew it was the convention that counted then at a dramatic moment two more geisha entered with a flourish and began a classical dance all fans and rustling silk it was a stunning floor show for those who appreciate slowmotion poses and flirtatiously exposed napes of neck between dances koriko urged more sake on the men joked with his majesty and with ken and induced them both to sing a racy song noda who sat there glaring was diplomatically ignored for her own part tam was finding this traditional geisha party extremely juvenile and silly was this what supposedly intelligent japanese businessmen consider the height of refined amusement all this fake flattery and cajoling mixed with not a few ribald double entendres how depressing after a few more songs and dances koriko and her ensemble began preparing to depart whereupon his majesty presented her with a small gift or perhaps an honorarium wrapped in gold paper and tied with an elaborate purple bow in keeping with etiquette she didnt open it merely thanked him graciously and tucked it into her obi she then caressed the ivory pegs of her shamisen with reverence saying she would treasure it forever as the unworthy instrument that had solaced the ears of his imperial majesty with a final bow to noda never hinting she knew him she backed out the door and was gone followed by the others his look of relief reminded tam of a man whod just walked away from a collapsing building whatever may have been tams or matsuo nodas secret thoughts about koriko the emperor clearly had had a rollicking time presumably he didnt have all that many occasions to flirt with geisha now slightly the worse for sake he began to wax pensive turning to his american guest and offering to provide an account of the battle of dannoura it was a definite switch of mood but korikos traditional songs seemed to have struck a nostalgic nerve or perhaps the sword had brought him a new enthusiasm for the past he wanted to share as he started recounting the battle tam smiled to think it was like having the queen herself brief you on that family squabble of yesteryear called the war of the roses that battle richardsonsan between the heike and genji clans was a turning point in the long history of our country it represented the rise to power of the warriors the shogunate he smiled politely im afraid the monarchy never quite recovered in fact today the crabs in the inland sea have a mark on the back of their shells that people say is like the insignia of the heike that they represent the fallen banners of the heike nobles he paused while a maid topped off his tiny cup with more hot sake i suppose youve seen them hai miraremashita of course she nodded stretching out her vowels to maximum politeness she wasnt sure she had actually but this was no time to appear like a dumb gaijin well after many years of fighting the heike nobles and the boy emperor they were defending fled to an island across the inland sea but the genji forces pursued them and eventually they were forced to take to their boats once more finally the battle was joined since the heike were experienced sailors they assumed they would prevail in a naval encounter and thus their commander unwisely elected to make his stand in the straits where the riptide was as quick and treacherous then as it is today at first he had the tide in his favor and they held the enemy but around noon the tide changed and was against them gradually the forces of the genji surrounded the ship bearing the emperor and the court his voice faltered slightly and she realized the story was still as fresh for him as if it had happened yesterday finally he continued as the sad story is told in the heike monogatari the court nobles saw a school of dolphins coming toward them they said if these turn back the genji will be destroyed and we will triumph if they proceed it will be a bad omen when the dolphins continued on even diving under their ships the heike realized they were lost and sure enough at that moment the genji ships began closing in now the tragic part the nurse of the boy emperor antoku was only eightresolved what she would do she donned a double outer dress of dark gray the color of mourning tucked up the long skirts of her heavy silk hakama robe and wrapped the sacred sword in her girdle then taking young antoku in her arms she moved to the gunwale of the vessel and looked down at the waves finally she said to the men of the court though i am only a woman i will not surrender myself to our enemies i will accompany our sovereign emperor on his journey at that moment little antoku looked up his long black hair streaming down his back and asked where are you taking me tears began to flow down her cheeks she said to him bow to the east and bid your farewell to the great shrine at ise our capital will no longer be kyoto but a place beneath the seas where there is no sorrow so the young antoku his white robes the color of the dove bowed east to isewhereupon the nurse holding him in one arm and the sacred sword in the other leapt into the waves next another woman tried to jump overboard with the casket holding the sacred mirror but an arrow pinned her hakama to the gunwales and the genji soldiers retrieved it all we know of what happened next is the dispatch they sent back to the new rulers in kyoto which declared the former emperor is at the bottom of the sea and the sacred mirror has been recovered but the sword is lost and a search is being made he turned and nodded toward noda only tonight eight centuries later can the rest be told at last the sword has been restored to us noda bowed low and offered a toast to the imperial line it was then that akira mori first spoke although she addressed her words to tam they were obviously meant for his majesty richardsonsan recovering the sword is a more important historical event than many realize its loss coincided with the end of imperial power in japan after that the emperor became a figurehead a captive of the shoguns she shot a quick glance at noda if the sword means nothing else it should remind us all that no shogun must ever be allowed to rise again whats she driving at tam wondered of course his majesty took up the theme although there was a time in this century when the militarists once again made a tool of the emperor of japan i agree it was wrong he looked at mori with admiration the respect your words show for the imperial house of yamato touches me deeply while she bowed in acknowledgment he turned to noda in the same manner nodasan japans important place in the modern world brings special respect to us as well for that we must thank you and all those helping to fashion the new japan tam watched noda puzzling something was going on some kind of coded crosstalk she didnt fully comprehend shogun emperor what was everybodys unspoken agenda at that point his majesty rose unsteadily and announced he had a heavy day ahead whereupon he summarily bade everyone good evening and exited imperial household guards in attendance tam noticed that mori watched his departure with a wistful worshipful gaze after he was gone a reverent stillness settled around them even ken normally talkative was subdued whats going on here she puzzled one thing was sure japan was like a magical onion with layers to be peeled away slowly each time you learn something new yet you never really get to the core when the last dishes had been cleared and nothing remained on their low table except fresh kettles of sake noda leaned back and broke the silence she realized he was speaking to her matsuo noda it quickly came to light was fully familiar with her books but that was merely the beginning next akira mori whod been quietly waiting her turn joined in were you moved by the story of the nurse who threw herself into the waves richardsonsan the one who sacrificed her own life to honor her ideals it was a very touching account tam looked at her surprised by the sudden friendliness i understand even more now why everybodys so excited about the sword presumably you know mori continued evenly that the young emperors nurse was undoubtedly fujiwara perhaps of low rank but nonetheless a member of the family that historically has been closest to the throne of course the fujiwara were always imperial retainers have you taken no interest in that family mori continued her face still revealing nothing i no not really tam studied her perhaps you should dr richardson she switched to flawless english are you aware that your own mother was fujiwara in fact it is possible that in your veins runs the same blood as the nurse who gave her life for the emperor that april day eight hundred years ago tam felt a numbness sweep over her shed never thought much about her real mother or father naturally there would have been no way of tracing him at least none she knew but of course thered be full records of the woman who bore her then put her up for adoption for some reason morior was it noda himselfhad had them looked up theyd uncovered something about her that she herself had never wanted for wellexamined reasons to explore her adoptive parents had been all anybody could desire why stir up unknowns besides she believed in nurture not nature you both seem to know a great many things about me her glance shifted back and forth between them she was surprised yes but if theyd assumed shed be stunned they were wrong shed decided long ago not to let herself care although your true mother no longer lives you are most certainly fujiwara mori went on you have blood ties with the family that once stood ready to give its life for the emperor therefore you may even have a connection with the sword itself noda moved in we also believe dr richardson that you because of your work could have a vital role in the endeavor dai nippon will soon undertake that is the reason we want to speak with you tonight at last tam thought im finally going to find out why matsuo noda accidentally happened to ask me along ive been waiting to hear this since the fusuma sliding doors were drawn closed shutting out the serving women noda breached conventional etiquette and reached across the table to pour more sake into tams tiny shino dish himself ken merely looked on silently as mori took up nodas theme we would like you to be part of something that would do honor to your fujiwara heritage dr richardson the noble family that so long served the emperor i may or may not be fujiwara morisan but i already have my work dr richardson do hear us out noda interjected pressing we wish to advise you that important even potentially disruptive events lie ahead for america very soon and we would like very much for someone such as yourself a pragmatist to be involved especially since in addition to your professional skills you are in a position to understand the cultures the attitudes of both americans and japanese your assistance could be invaluable invaluable for what purpose a worthy undertaking we assure you think of it if you will as an attempt to prevent japan and the west from going to war with each other again she looked back and forth between the two of them trying to fathom what they were driving at then noda continued revealing again that nothing had happened by chance we brought you here today to ise to remind you of the importance of your japanese heritage a heritage whose sole purpose is like shinto itself the peace and ordering of the world whats this all about she looked at ken in a black silk kimono serenely sipping his sake and looking the essence of cultivated tantalizing otherness did you have anything to do with this he carefully set down his shino dish and smoothed his long sleeve i did have occasion to remind nodasama that you have a unique combination of background and expertise tamara that could be very instrumental in the realization of his objectives and what are his objectives she looked back at noda your objectives you dr richardson should appreciate this better than anyone he studied his sake saucer there are things the west excels at doing and there are areas i trust it is not improper to say in which we japanese have demonstrated aptitude why should we compete in each others spheres it leads only to divisiveness we open ourselves to predators from the steppes of the caucasus to the oilrich deserts of araby but if we join together the peoples of japan and america can achieve insurmountable strength youre talking about something that would more properly be in the realm of diplomacy nodasan he laughed pardon me dr richardson but diplomacy is merely the window dressing for reality the world cares not a penny for diplomacy only for power no one troubled about the persian gulf states until they had opec and the rest of us had no petroleum then suddenly they were toasted worldwide as men of great moment that is the meaning of diplomacy the reason i knew you would understand the importance of ise he went on is that in your genes you are part of us you appreciate the value of harmony one of the first teachings of our philosophy there must be harmony between man and his world what does that please just allow me to finish in like manner there must also be harmony between nations yet all we hear about today is friction usually trade friction between our nations but what can be done the solutions we hear talked of seem for reasons political and otherwise impossible to implement so what course does that leave you speak of diplomacy but already diplomacy has been shown inadequate why we might ask is that so because as your thomas jefferson observed many years ago money is the principal exchange of civilized nations diplomacy comes out of economic power it was trade that estranged our two nations once before in this century leading to a conflict neither of us desired and it is money that creates these frictions we hear about so much today since diplomacy has failed we must now find other means to bring stability and thus harmony to both our nations she was tempted to ask him how all the rightwing nationalistic fervor he was churning up with the sword would contribute to this socalled harmony but instead she inquired what specifically he was proposing the most pressing problem america has today dr richardson is the growing inability of your industries to compete if i may be allowed to generalize americas strength has long been in innovation but i think it is reasonable to suggest that japanese management has had a commensurate share of success so much so that we have been the subject of a flurry of books in your country he smiled even i should add several very insightful volumes written by you yourself also japanese industry has already been part of a number of joint ventures instituting our management techniques in the service of americas business well unquestionably we do have problems in our industrial sector just now tam interjected but japan has plenty of difficulties of its own most assuredly he nodded however as some might put it the proof is in the pudding i merely ask you to compare your and our balance of trade or productivity surely these both suggest there is truth in what i say at that point akira mori abruptly seized the floor you know dr richardson there are those in your country who are now saying your trade problems are caused by japan that we should work less save less squander more just as you do perhaps so we will selfdestruct economically as america is now doing and no longer be an embarrassment to you that is hardly noda tried to break in but she waved him aside no this needs to be said i am tired of hearing americans tell us to follow their example she turned back your media chastise us for our thrift and hard work while your businessmen who are happy enough to grow rich retailing the superior goods we make refuse to invest their profits in modernizing their own factories instead they give themselves bonuses and japan lectures at that she wound down to the obvious relief of noda and ken the outburst seemed to pass as quickly as it had come but it succeeded in reinforcing tarns reservations about akira mori so what exactly do you have in mind she looked back at noda dr richardson no one in japan desires to see americas industrial base disintegrate that is dangerous for the future both yours and ours yet joint ventures and management seminars are too little too late we and by we i mean dai nippon are determined to make a more structured contribution as he laid out his plan she realized that matsuo noda had decided to play god still in this world such things were possible all it took was enough financial clout if anybody doubted that just remember opec but that was the last time around now japan had the money maybe the oil billionaires of years past had no good idea what to do with their winnings but matsuo noda had a very precise idea indeed the one remaining problem he needed tamara richardson chapter eleven in the aftermath of that evening down in ise tam was convinced of only one fact nobody was giving her the straight story not noda not mori not ken and when she tried to talk supercomputers with miti officials at the kyoto conference she again sensed she was hearing a runaround suddenly all she could get was japans public face that version of reality japanese executives call tatemae superficial and soothing assurances intended to promote the wa harmony so desirable in human affairs when japan doesnt care to give answers hai no longer translates as yes it just means i heard you even more troublesome was the question of ken as best she could tell he was merely a reluctant accomplice in nodas grand design but why was he going along with dai nippon if he was as apprehensive as he seemed ken she concluded knew a lot more about matsuo noda than he was saying so instead of giving them all an answer outright she decided to spend a few days analyzing what shed managed to piece together so far as noda had couched his proposition it was simple he was offering her a chance to do more than merely write prescriptions for americas economic recovery she would guide it one thing matsuo noda was no proponent of half measures the way he laid out his scenario it was visionary no revolutionary after thinking over his proposal for a week she still wasnt sure whether he was brilliant or a megalomaniac dai nippons program could conceivably change the course of world history and the prospect of being at the helm of its juggernaut was seductive all the same what if kens hints were right what if noda did have something much grander in mind something impossible even to imagine when you ride the whirlwind whos really in charge in between her visits to the conference she spent some time at dnis kyoto offices getting acquainted with nodas operationthe computers fiberoptic links analysts very impressive although dai nippon was technically only a shell corporation all matsuo noda had to do was pick up a phone to have at his disposal the expertise of any one of a hundred japanese corporate brain trusts half of japans new hightech movers it seemed owed him some kind of obligation given that and all the money he could well be unstoppable also the austerity of dai nippons offices reminded her once again that none of japans new power was accidental the discipline of the samurai it was almost as though this country had been in training for centuries toughening itself through selfdenial and workasduty to be ready for an allout economic blitz now finally japan had an edge on the entire world more technology and more money was noda about to just give away that edge the implausibility made her certain something was missing late that friday the conference over she and ken packed their bags and checked out of the international but after theyd shoved their way through the usual pandemonium in the lobby and hailed a cab he gave the driver the name of a place on shinmonzen street the antique district not the train station when she tried to correct him he waved his hand and said hed arranged for a surprise tam the international always leaves a bad taste in my mouth it has nothing to do with japan it could be anywhere just like some hilton next to a freeway he smiled and lightly patted her hand lets not go back to tokyo just yet please this weekend lets stay at a place where nothing will exist but you and me not even time just turn off the clocks sounded like a great idea well now and then its nice to turn them down a bit dont you think he laughed selfconsciously thats a contradiction about me youll someday have to get used to i like a hightech office but when im away i prefer to be surrounded by things that are very very old he leaned back indulge me let me show you my favorite spot in all of kyoto a place time forgot this is going to be quite a trick she told herself very little was left from years past maybe the city hadnt been bombed out during the war but the blitz of urban renewal was rapidly accomplishing much the same result through the light of dusk construction cranes loomed above the few remaining thatched roofs of neighborhoods about to be overwhelmed by steel glass cinderblock kenji asano it turned out deplored this immensely as they rode along he pointed out the latest construction sites with the sorrow of a man documenting the end of civilization this we hear is the price of progress im always tempted to ask progress toward what he leaned back with a sigh and lit a peace cigarette nonfilter someday i think we may have to ask ourselves if this modern world weve created for ourselves was actually worth the toll its taken on our sensibilities eventually their taxi pulled into a narrow side street edging past a few women carrying small bundles of groceries bound in scarves then easing to a stop before the ramshackle bamboo gates of a place that seemed abandoned to foliage and vines the driver helped carry their bags in through the gates and up the rocky hedgelined pathway leading to a wooden veranda ahead was a thatchroofed weathered house shrouded by towering elms as they approached an elderly woman in a dark kimono emerged from the recesses of the interior she sang out a welcome bowed deeply and produced two pairs of leather slippers with an air of ritual solemnity they were expected off went the street shoes on went the slippers as they melted into a world that would have been perfectly natural four centuries ago when they passed the lobbyoff to the side tatamifloored with a few ancient screens scattered abouttam noticed that there appeared to be no desk but there was also no check in the proprietress clearly knew the honorable asanosan she also must have known he was with miti since her honorifics soared into the upper reaches of politeness as she guided them along the interior hallway tam realized they were in a traditional japanese inn a ryokan surely the last vestige of classical japan as they moved out onto another veranda this one circling a central garden and pond the place appeared to be totally empty the woodland vista in the center hinted of infinity with stone paths and a wide pool dotted with shapely rocks although there were a dozen or so closed doors along the wooden platform the inn seemed to be there solely for them in the cool dusk clumps of willows across the pond masked the view of the other side furthering the illusion that they had the place all to themselves it couldnt be true though since chambermaids in kimono darted here and there balancing lacquered dinner trays when they reached the end of the veranda their hostess paused before a set of shoji screens knelt and pushed aside the ricepaper covered frames to reveal a room entirely bare except for a low lacquer table well not quite on the back wall was the traditional picture alcove tokonoma in which a seventeenthcentury inkwash scroll hung above a weathered vase holding three spare blossoms their room had no keys no clocks no television it was a cocoon for the spirit a place of textured woods crisp tatami lacquer and ricepaper the woman deposited their bags on the blackbordered tatami consulted briefly with ken concerning dinner then backed bowing out of the room leaving them alone together in another time ken this is perfect i needed someplace like this we both did he embraced her theyre running our tub now afterward i have another surprise for you what allow me some mystery whatever he had planned she couldnt wait to throw off her clothes don a loose cotton yukata robe and pad with him down to the little woodlined room where their steaming bath awaited the floor was red tile the walls scented chinese black pine the massive tub cedar with rivulets of steam escaping through cracks in its cypress cover while they perched on little stools beside the tub he soaped her back occasionally dousing her with the bucket of lukewarm water then she did the same for him watching half mesmerized as the soapy bubbles flowed off his shoulders broad and strong almost like an athletes finally they climbed in and amidst the cloud of vapor her last remaining tensions melted away you know i think of you every time i come to kyoto wanting to lure you back he reached for the brush and began to gently massage her neck i honestly never dreamed matsuo noda would come along and try to hire you he paused i wish i could help you make your decision but the most i can do is warn you to be careful what are you telling me she wondered ken you seem troubled about something what is it tamara powerful forces are at play here beyond the control of either of us things may not always be what they seem just be aware of that but please dont ask me any more just look out for yourself ive had a lifetime of looking out for myself i can handle matsuo noda just dont ever underestimate him hes not like anyone youve ever known before the man is pure genius probably the most visionary powerful mind in the history of this country youve met your match that remains to be seen she leaned back ken was challenging her now on purpose maybe he figured that was the only bait she would rise to he wanted her to play along with noda but he wouldnt tell her why after theyd simmered to medium rare heading for well done they climbed out toweled each other off slipped back into their yukatas once again and glided back to the room she noticed that an interior screen had been pushed aside opening onto another tatami room where a thin futon mattress had already been unrolled and prepared with white sheets and a thick brocade coverlet hot tea waited on their little lacquer table but their bags had disappeared she checked behind a pair of sliding doors and saw that all her things had been neatly shelved by some invisible caretaker even the clothes shed been wearing were already hung in the closet now for my surprise he was slipping on a black silk kimono they have a special little garden here that only a few people know about ive arranged everything shouldnt i change too for whatever it is were doing theoretically yes but formality doesnt suit you he cinched his obi come on you can be formally informal he led the way to the end of the veranda where they each put on the wooden clogs that were waiting then they passed through a bamboo gate into yet another landscape this one lit by candles set in stone lanterns at the back stood a small oneroom structure of thatch reed and unfinished wood a teahouse tam can you sit here for a second in the waiting shelter he indicated a bench just inside the gate under a thatch overhang ill only need a few minutes to prepare off he went clogs clicking along a string of stones nestled in among the mossy floor of the garden he was following the roji the dewy path that led to the teahouse half hidden among the trees at the back unlike the ryokan s larger garden this one had no water it was meant to recall a mountain walk the space was small with natural trees offering no illusion of being more than it was but it was a classic setting for tea a kind of deliberate poverty while she watched the flickering stone lanterns and listened to the night crickets the cacophony of kyoto could have been eons away finally ken appeared beside the doorway of the teahouse and signaled her forward as she moved along the stepping stones she noticed that the pathway had been swept clean of falling leaves after which the gardener had strewn a few back to give it wabi an unaffected natural look the art of artlessness she thought as she paused at a stone water basin to rinse her mouth from its bamboo dipper part of the preparatory ritual the chanoyu or tea ceremony she knew required almost a lifetime to master completely it was a seated ballet of nuance and perfect clarity of motion one awkward gesture and its carefully orchestrated perfection could be spoiled she hoped she could remember the rules well enough to get it right ken was already seated across from her tending a small charcoal brazier sunk into the tatamimatted floor from its light she could just make out the rooms roughhewn timbers the straw and mud walls bark and bamboo ceiling a small calligraphy scroll hung in the tokonoma alcove as he beckoned her formally to sit the room was caught in an unearthly silence the only sound the sonorous boiling of the kettle ken was profoundly transformed almost like another being warm and attentive only minutes before now he was part of a different world solemn and remote the black silk of his kimono seemed to enforce the seriousness in his dark eyes she watched as he ritually wiped a thin delicately curved bamboo scoop with a folded cloth first touching the handle then the uptilted end after which he balanced it atop the lacquer tea caddy next he lifted the tea bowl an earthtone glaze that shifted from mauve to brown as he rotated it in his hand and wiped the rim finally he swabbed the bottom and positioned the bowl on the tatami in front of him now the utensils had been formally cleansed he was ready from the tea caddy he spooned a mound of jadegreen powdered tea and tapped it into the bowl then another this last with a carefully prescribed twist of the scoop next he extracted a dipperful of boiling water from the iron kettle and measured a portion into the bowl lifted the bamboo whisk sitting inverted beside the bowl and commenced a vigorous blending the tea immediately began to resemble a pale green lather still no words no sound save the whir of his whisk intruded upon the quiet of the room it was a moment hundreds of years old framed in silence the economy of ideal form that she found herself thinking was what this was all about how flawlessly could you perform what seemed the most simple humble act and he was good whereas the mastery in his hands revealed itself by the control with which he whipped the tea the rest of his body remained taut as a spring total discipline each tiny motion was distilled to its crystalline essence at last when the green froth was ready he gave the whisk a final halfturn then set it aside next he lifted the bowl rotated it in his hand and placed it on the mat beside the open charcoal fire his part was over it was as though the authority had been passed ken had prepared the work now it was her turn to take up and finish it her role was different yet required its own kind of skill she bent forward and ceremonially shifted the bowl a short distance toward her then she scooted backward on the tatami and again moved the bowl closer was she doing it right the flicker in kens eyes said yes finally with a bow of acknowledgment she raised the bowl in both hands and brought it to her lips after her first sip she bowed again then drank it down as he watched in silent approval the powdered green tea was harsh and bitter just as she remembered from times past even for a japanese it was difficult to feign appreciation of the musky beverage produced in the chanoyu she recalled what was next with deliberate dignity she extracted a small napkin from the obi of her loose yukata wiped the rim of the bowl and placed it carefully onto the tatami in front of her the motion had to be quick spare ken didnt try to disguise his pleasure she had passed some sort of crucial test and she told herself he had too together they had joined in one of the most demanding yet exquisite bonds two people can share at that moment she feltwas it imaginationlike an ancient fujiwara celebrating some ageold tradition the ceremony was over now she bowed again then lifted the bowl to admire the light crackle in the glaze the slightly inturned lip its raku i think its the finest ive ever seen from my collection its by the hand of chojiro the seventeenthcentury korean who was in the employ of the shogun hideyoshi he smiled i had it brought down to kyoto especially for tonight for you im honored she was after she had admired the rest of the utensilsthe remaining formality of chanoyuthey both relaxed their minds purged their spirits attuned like the ceremony itself the moment was esthetic and sensual tam this has been a wonderful rebirth for me being with you again youve helped revive in me so many feelings id almost forgotten the joy of it all who could have known he leaned back and reached for a flask of plum wine formalities were definitely over as someone once wrote love its roots are deep its source unknowable he was pouring two small glasses thats from the tsurezuregusa fourteenth century right again you amaze me you really are japanese i like the poetry then you know tam our poets excel in feeling weve always celebrated emotion over logic he smiled which one said love is the passion in the heart of manthose who will not listen to reason what does reason have to do with love she took a glass didnt shakespeare say love and reason keep little company together my turn thats from midsummer nights dream which was sixteenth century youre pulling out the moderns on me he laughed with delight you know in heian times eight hundred years ago here in kyoto id be expected to make a linked verse about the night now he looked out the doorway then back how about the moon in veil perfumed with night who can deny love at a time like this then his visage quickened another mood switch his eyes mellowed as he turned and carefully lifted the bud from the vase behind him it was a camellia purest white he held it before him as he turned back its long stem still dripping you know theres a haiku by basho i love very much let me give it in japanese a haiku only sounds right in the original time ga ka ni notto hi no deru yama ji kana she paused to let the meaning sink in to feel that open ended sensation a good haiku always sends your imagination spinning off into hows this for the english with the scent of plums on the mountain roadsuddenly sunrise comes not bad he glanced at the blossom in his hand i dont know why but the camellia makes me think of you he rotated it carefully then looked back lets dedicate tonight to our own sunrise he inspected the flower again then impulsively leaned forward and placed it onto the tatami in front of her next with the same control in his powerful hands that had touched the glaze of the tea bowl he gently gripped the shoulders of her loose yukata she felt her body flush with warmth as slowly gently his strength once more held in check he carefully slid back the cloth off her shoulders until her breasts were free then plucking a petal from the bud he reverently brushed one nipple then the other it was an erotic game she knew he loved one of many games sometimes she had imagined them inhabiting an eighteenthcentury shunga those woodblock prints picturing lovers in what she had once thought impossible embraces hed once declared that the kimono was actually the most sensual garment in the world take a look at some of the shunga he said and the possibilities become obvious though it seems cumbersome entangling yet it lifts away like a stage curtain to invite all sorts of dramatic possibilities the human nude is only interesting when half concealed games she reached and took the petal from him then ran it along the silk of his own kimono over his muscular thighs as he sat japanesestyle feet back next she lifted away the silk from the flawless ivory skin she knew so well she drew it along his thighs to tease him tam he reached to slip away her yukata but she caught his hand then she touched his lips with her fingers silencing his protest she pushed away his kimono and trailed the petal upward lightly brushing his own nipples finally she pushed him gently backward and smoothed her cheek against his thigh drawing back his kimono even more the glow of the coals was dying now as the last shadows played against his face she laid the petal on the tatami and moved across him they lingered till the moon was up then strolled back through the garden wearing their antique wooden clogs the air was scented musical with the sounds of night later that evening they downed an eightcourse meal off antique stoneware plates drank steaming sake on the veranda then made love for hours on the futon around midnight he ordered one more small bottle of sake a go and suggested they move out onto the veranda again this time to watch the moon break over the trees she slipped on her yukata and padded out shed just decided tamara i want to tell you something he poured her small porcelain cup to the brim you are everything matsuo noda is seeking the way you held the tea bowl tonight tasted the tea the chanoyu doesnt lie you have discipline our discipline thats very very rare you mean for a gaijin for anyone besides i dont think of you that way you are one of us now she looked into his eyes dark in the moonlight then she remembered the tokonoma alcove in the teahouse where a rugged vase had held the single white bud its few petals moist as though from dew not a bouquet a single budall the flowers in the world distilled into that one now poised to burst open kenji asano lived that special intensity that passion which set japan apart from the rest of the world ken her voice was quiet ill do it you mean noda noda he said nothing for a moment then finally he spoke the game begins chapter twelve over the last three weeks id spent long hours on the phone handling matsuo nodas new hedging in the currency markets the play started out modestly but as his eight hundred year funds became bloated with cash it grew into an avalanche of speculative positions his guiding principle was to keep a low profile in order not to spook the markets same as any good trader would do whenever the forex desk of one marketmaker bank on his list would start getting nervous id just hit the next place in line finally after everybody on this side of the ocean began backing away he went international zurich in particular loved the action and took everything he threw in its direction i guess the swiss are used to high rollers since their financial casino never got cold feet and invented a house limit somewhere along the way i also came to realize i couldnt possibly be the only agent in his employ there was far too much money to move also my list of contracts eventually got pared to manageable levels so somebody else had to be picking up the slack it appeared that just as i was spreading the action hed assigned to me all over the globe he was spreading his own assignments worldwide the man had to be covering a major chunk of the world market in interestrate futures and currency forwards but not a penny of it was traceable to japan or to matsuo noda how i kept marveling could this be happening right under the nose of all our supposed geniuses of world finance one thing noda had all his moves down pat my hunch was hed started routing a lot of short selling through sydney and hong kong and also was hitting the offexchange third market anyplace he could find somebody to take his bets if you remember how the dollar plunged in the mideighties youll also recall that anybody whod had the foresight to dump it in advance would have been sitting pretty plenty of traders did but none of them received any particular attention since the pond is so huge in cumulative totals the currency exchanges worldwide easily handle as much as two hundred billion dollars a day although dnis massive short position clearly signaled that somebody major was anticipating a crash of the dollar noda realized that all he had to do was keep moving and nobody would put it together need i add that my own little dollar hedge for amy was peanuts compared to what was going on now dai nippon through its anonymous agents was dumping american currency in the multibillions worldwide but since noda kept the action spread out nobody bothered to notice the pattern ditto his awesome naked shorting of treasury futures i mean anybody whod troubled to assemble the numbers could have predicted somebody up on the bridge must have sighted a reef dead ahead i kept trying to warn traders i knew both on and off the exchanges but nobody wanted to hear downbeat speculation from some cassandra they were all too busy pocketing commissions and ordering more champagne and then it happened in broad daylight ill explain the operative details shortly but if you were there that could be a little like reviewing the theory underlying nuclear fission for somebody standing at ground zero when the bomb hit so first let me recollect how it felt down in the trenches i was breakfasting at the dining room table downstairs that particular monday morningnovember as we all remember so vividlywhen matsuo noda dropped the first shoe or maybe its more accurate to say he began loosening the laces id just finished squeezing some orange juice when i punched in the number of a financial update service on my trusty cordless phone mainly to hear the recorded sound of a human voice id totally forgotten the us treasury was holding its quarterly refunding that day newsbreak dealer banks were reporting that demand for the long bond the thirtyyear was extremely soft to nonexistent equally unnerving there wasnt any noticeable interest in treasurys tenyear notes either the reason seemed to be that the usual heavy participation by major japanese investment houses typically twenty to forty percent of the total had inexplicably evaporated in fact a rumor currently flying across the floor of the chicago board of trade said a number of japanese securities houses and banks in new york had begun what appeared to be a program to divest their current treasury holdings massively since spokespersons at japanese outfits like nomura and daiwa securities had clammed up refusing to deny that rumor the usual institutional buyers like oppenheimer and goldman sachs were holding back nervous hang on i said to myself can this mean were about to test out hendersons worst case scenario that japanese pullout all the analysts say could never happen but theres no reason no sudden icebergs out ahead noda i said the word out loud nodas kicked off his play i almost laughed at the thought of his naivete was this going to be his game who was he planning to fool for once youve got a little surprise in store chum treasury may have to sweeten the pot but theres a lot of money in the world the united states of america cant be blackmailed then i glanced out at the blue morning sky empty except for a single swooping sparrow and had a strange premonition one of those mystical moments when everything sparkles with crystalline clarity i had this feeling i cant explain still in a reverie i carefully set down my orangejuice glass walked upstairs to the office and dialed one of the computers into reuterss wall street service how were the securities markets taking the news it was already tenthirty time enough for some initial response dear god for a second or so i just stared at the numbers in disbelief what was happening noda hadnt gone near the stock market i quickly switched on the tv and located cnn which was already carrying a special report live from the floor of the new york stock exchange there stood a badly shaken lou dobbs minus his tie minus in fact his jacket the scene around him was pandemonium and the dow jones averagehe glanced down at a monitor has dropped six hundred and eighty points in the last twenty minutes at that moment somebody jostled against the cameraman giving us a momentary view of the ocean of paper buyandsell slips littering the floor a hundred and ninety million shares have already changed hands in the first half hour of trading this morning my god i thought the market is in freefall was meltdown monday in just the warmup as yet unconfirmed rumors concerning a slow foreign response to todays treasury auctionalthough he was weighing his words carefully to give the appearance of calm the hasty makeup on his forehead was already beginning to bubble with perspiration seem to be responsible for what most analysts are describing as an entirely inappropriate overreaction in securities prices here this morning what else could he say it was as though everybodys gnawing primal fear had just been confirmed there really was a hairy beast lurking in the bedroom closet waiting to jump out and eat us in our sleep the market was running to mommy safe and soothing cash next he made the tactical error of buttonholing a couple of floor traders and specialists for comments they didnt bother to mince words their one terrified question had japan finally decided to let the us and its towering debt just twist slowly in the wind if that happened us capital would simply dry up sucked in by treasurys massive moneysponge interest rates would soar murdering the us economy the great depression of the nineties as i watched a bulletin started running across the bottom of the screen bids on the new issue of thirtyyear bonds had now dropped an amount equivalent to raising their return almost two full interest points i zeroed in as the text continued worse news the coverage ratio which measures how many more bidders there are than necessary had plummeted from to and still dropping more and more potential buyers were running for cover lou who was now surrounded by traders in blue jackets and couldnt see his own monitor was assuring his viewers that experienced market analysts were all saying the slowdown in treasury action did not accurately reflect worldwide demand that deutsche marks and pounds sterling undoubtedly were already winging westward to take advantage of the new higher rates sweating there in his melting pancake the poor guy had no inkling the patient was slipping into a coma just as hed forecast full recovery well i thought theres always prayer anythings possible but as henderson used to say if frogs had wings they wouldnt bump their ass i got up to go downstairs and pour another cup of coffee coming back i decided to forget about the stock market for a moment and just focus on treasury so i clicked on my telerate service and scrolled through the financial quotes friends by that time there was no repeat no market out there for treasury paper now that the japanese dealers appeared to be dumping everything european banks had hit the sidelines waiting to see what transpired would rates continue to move up would treasury be forced to withdraw the issue should everybody be bailing out now before bond prices went through the deck and demolished years of interest earnings looming over it all was that standing terror of the bond markets no liquidity back to cable news network an officer from one of the dealer banks which bid on big chunks of treasury paper then retail it had rushed over to cnns midtown studios and was explaining to us all it was clearly nothing more than some minor transpacific communications snarl the problem obviously was simple japanese securities firms here just hadnt received authorization from their head offices in tokyo where it was after business hours a clarification would be forthcoming any minute now well if youve ever been turned down for a mortgage and you fantasized a day when youd see that highandmighty clerk behind the desk have to ask you for a loan i hope you caught that one this papershuffler whose secretary had a secretary had agreed a week earlier to take on three billion dollars of treasurys new debt issuespaper he now couldnt give away let alone reselland he was practically on his knees begging america to save his bank what the hell was going on my mildmannered friend matsuo noda had inadvertently i assumed kicked off a major financial panic i clicked the dial over to financial news network fnn which had momentarily interrupted its heavy midday fare of california snakeoilandoptions hucksters now a decidedly pale investment banker this one an unindicted employee of drexel burnham was declaring it was all merely a little tempest in a teapot his precise words the japanese securities houses wouldnt dare pull out their funds and kill the market he explained it was absurd if they did that their investors would lose a fortune since any big selloff would automatically drive down the value of their own massive portfolio ergo japans funds had no choice but to stay invested no problem my friend i thought where have americas bankers been out repossessing some widows chevy as a matter of fact the japanese outfits here dont give a flying fig what happens to our debt market if youd been doing your job youd know that matsuo noda had already sold treasury futures far in excess of japans portfolio back when values were still high now he can go out and pick up all the notes and bonds he wants cost approximately nothing and turn around and deliver them at yesterdays full price the man must feel like a riverboat cardsharp whos lucked into a saloon full of huck finns on payday dont you realize hes just cleaned you out right down to the fillings in your teeth and now hes got his team on the bus ready to roll over to cbs a special report underway it featured a stream of wellmeaning and incoherent treasury officials none of whom had the slightest inkling what to say then jack odonnell came on from the senate pressroom breathing fire the administrations light at the end of the deficit tunnel had turned out to be a freight train heading our way just as hed predicted americas debt chickens were coming home to roost he was demanding that the speaker call a joint session of congress this very day and by god do something right jack what looks like our pal matsuo noda is about to have the us of a exactly where he wants us by the balls i guess i must have been operating solely on instinct by then because a phone number popped into my head that i hadnt recalled in years sam kline my old broker at merrill lynch i hadnt talked to sam in ages but his number used to come to my fingers whenever the market started acting up maybe he was sort of a father figure truth is id first learned what little i know about the market watching that giant ticker ml had up at one end of the office just above sams deskand long gone in this age of computers i remembered how heavy tradesover ten thousand shareswere marked with stars always fun to watch forget the financial experts they were reduced to spouting pure gibberish time to check in at the real front line sam kline maybe i just wanted to have sam to soothe me like in the old days pour some of that dreadful coffee he had in his thermos tug down the cuffs of his trousers and say not to worry theres always tomorrow the disaster in my portfolio merely reflected a longoverdue and healthy correction in the market only years later did i finally realize that correction was a special wall street expression meaning all the stocks you own just tanked when sam finally got around to my call he was barely coherent but still trying matt whats new there was turmoil and yelling behind him as though the office was about to go under a wrecking ball you tell me well at the moment its something of a downside morning but sam i snapped this is me matt save the pollyanna a short pause and then he crumbled matthew want the truth the monday massacre of was a rally compared to this that crash was just stocks this time its us bonds the dollar everything the markets falling apart right this minute the trust departments at first boston and morgan are dumping entire sectors like they were some nervous greenhorn in oshkosh pension fund managers ive known for years are liquidating whole blocks at the market for whatever they can get one specialist downtown just told me he had to eat a hundred thousand shares of christ general dynamics you cant give away northrop and lockheed forget it another pause god almighty matt we need a market up here how about not now sam it was like hanging up on my own father a knife in my heart look ill get back to you best to naomi good god i wanted to hire an airplane and skywrite a big sign over downtown wait trouble was i wasnt sure myself what it was all about however there was one thing i could do i punched in the contact number for dai nippon uptown and told the polite little lady who answered the phone to get tanaka on the line this goddam minute about ten seconds later he was there are you guys nuts i yelled doesnt anybody up there know whats happening we are well aware of the situation mr walton well then do something for chrissake our securities dealers here are in contact with the appropriate officials nothing is to be done without explicit instructions from nodasan he has not yet been in communication well get him in communication there is no cause for alarm mr walton he continued calmly nodasan has made sure that our dealers exposure in treasuries is covered by the futures contracts dni has acquired japanese investors are sheltered from price fluctuations nodasan is most grateful for your listen carefully i said fuck noda i hung up the rest of the morning i just sat there and watched the market crater after bond futures prices on the chicago exchanges had sunk the daily limit as far as they could drop in a single session the action merely moved elsewhere a cash market developed offexchange worldwide and was going crazy with spot quotes nosediving prices now were only rumors but the satellite services were still trying to track them at exactly pm the president finally got around to issuing an executive order suspending all trading at the exchanges in government bills notes and bonds including futures contracts until further notice it turned out to have been about as effective as prohibition besides by that time i figured noda had already cleared at least fifty billion enough i couldnt watch anymore all of a sudden i felt like a guy whod bailed out of his flaming f only to see it total a schoolhouse i kicked off the computer slipped on a suede jacket and headed for bleecker street to fortify myself with mussels marinara and a stiff bloody mary the early post at the corner newsstand proclaimed with characteristic understatement the imminent passing of the civilized world over cappuccino i finally started to think rationally nothing anybody was saying added up to a full picture there had to be more or less to the story then the truth glimmered before my eyes yet another transcendental moment what noda was planning was obvious at last i realized why hed hired me like a great chess player he could see about ten moves ahead the question now was no longer what his next move would be it was when you want to win world war iii with a quick blitzkrieg knock america to its knees simple go for the blind side first you short a piece of the debt market then for fun you dump the currency in advance since its just naturally gonna go the way of the peso when you make your opening move and you might as well squeeze the orange if its just lying there anyway next you kick things off by giving everybody the impression youre divesting all treasury paper which causes the dollar to predictably plummet christ what about amys currency hedge three weeks ago id contracted to sell the banks of new york ten million dollars she didnt own in all the pandemonium id completely forgotten i threw down a twenty for the lunch and literally raced around the corner to look for a pay phone on macdougal when i finally found one that worked i shoved in a quarter and dialed the forex desk at citibank for a dollar quote henderson was right paper money is predicated on trust it seems that when the second largest industrial nation in the world apparently doesnt think enough of the credit rating of the first largest industrial nation in the world to loan it two cents then talk about the full faith and credit of said first largest etc doesnt cut much ice the fed was out there buying dollars and dumping marks and yen and pounds in the billions to try and keep the dollar afloat but nobody else in the group of fivethose countries supposed to step in and buy each others faltering currencies to prop them upwas lifting a finger in spite of our treasury secretary yelling fire and damnation all theyd done was announce an evening meeting in paris period what they inquired had the us done lately to help out france west germany britain or japan behind our allies diplomatic and notsodiplomatic posturing lay a simple rhetorical question who needed passage on a sinking ship at the moment the only thing governments around the world wanted less than us treasury debt was us greenbacks id contracted to swap ten million of them for other currencies back when they were worth a dollar that afternoon i settled with bills worth eighty cents and sinking thats right amys collegefund hedge cleared two mil and if you think miss amy walton survived the dollars crash intact what about matsuo noda now holding tens and tens of billions in world currency forwards what didnt prosper that monday was a state of mind called wall street by midafternoon all the market indexes were down by half exchange trading had been halted in a good two thirds of the dow stocks a major brokerage house had frozen accounts and announced chapter and gold futures were soaring the october crash of was now a nostalgia item remembered as a few sessions of light trading with a hint of downside bias a lot of investors went to cash but most switched into money funds what else could they do while sophisticated players were shorting the stock indexes and futures the newsletter guruswho charged two hundred dollars a year for hot tips about equal in worth to those of a new york cabbiewere calling their major clients a big sell signal was emblazoned in the streets of lower manhattan everybody assumed the situation was temporary but nobody needed to ride the ship down by the closing bell the dow had sunk over eleven hundred and fifty points and dont forget the dj average represents blue chips prices for overthecounter outfits like widgettronics inc just packed up and headed south for the winter the way i figured it noda was probably more or less on schedule by nightfall the stock exchanges had blood on the floor a dollar was worth roughly twothirds what it had been at sunup and the us treasury couldnt have panhandled a nickel anywhere in the free world ive mentioned jack odonnell a time or so previously the columbia university professor turned politico jack was the junior senator from new york irish idealism goes to washington id gotten to know him reasonably well thanks mainly to a series of rubberchicken dinners id pitched in to help him with needless to say odonnells wellknown attitude toward fiscal sleightofhand in the corporate sector had made raising money on wall street a decidedly uphill endeavor his insider of the month award was especially unpopular that was a large goldplated screw suitable for mounting which he regularly bestowed on any corporate board members whod just happened to dump big blocks of their personal holdings about a week before a disappointing quarterly report sent their companys stock price through the floor for some reason jack never seemed to buy their collective gee we had no idea explanation jack always assumed that corporate managements would walk off with anything not securely riveted to the floor he also believed most of the corporate takeovers these days were about as helpful to americas competitiveness as masturbation was to population growth a viewpoint i tended to sharewhich is one reason why i helped him raise money from time to time more than that though i admired him immensely the man was a real samurai unfortunately however he was his own worst enemy half the time when it came to soliciting campaign checks he could never understand why executive dining rooms werent necessarily the optimum terrain to start raising hell about shareholders rights i once sent him a dog muzzle for christmas after he pulled just that trick at a ceo fundraiser id carefully set up in one of those private suites atop the world trade center hed been especially busy this session when he did come to new york he spent most of his time up at the west side apartment of a female aide of his where they reportedly were polishing a lot of position papers these days monday however he had only one thing on his mind how to keep the us monetary system from going belly up trouble was he had no idea what to do naturally he immediately canceled his subcommittee hearings for the dayan inquiry into how charge cards and the banks touting them loving those wonderful loanshark rates were lofting consumer debt to dizzying heights that afternoon he began working on a speech for the senate floor a hellfire preachment intended to shame the administration into some kind of action after thinking about it awhile hed decided that since all the nervousness in the market was traceable to an apparently total japanese loss of confidence in us government obligations hed have his staff call around concerning what other japanese moves were underway he had questions such as if theyre pulling out of treasuries are they dumping corporate bonds too real estate where in blazes is it going to stop simple questions maybe but tough ones to attack on short notice given the clampdown at the source so his people started making calls and finally one of them got hold of charlie mercer an executive vp at shearson purely chance did charlie happen to know any big japanese players in town well yes and no replied charlie strictly off the record one of his biggest personal clients lately was an attorney here in new york who always paid with corporate checks bearing the logo of a japanesesounding outfit but it was a purely private arrangement and he was sure the staffer immediately told him to please hold while she switched the call to senator odonnell actually id known charlie for years and i also knew the poor guys wife had some kind of esoteric bone cancer that meant ten thou a month in radiation therapy so id let him set up an account on the side and do some full commission churning in the name of one of dai nippons dummy fronts why not then jack came on the line mr mercer am i to understand youve been handling heavy trades for a japanese firm nothing illegal about that is there senator charlie was growing nervous suddenly seeing himself under the hot glare of tv lights in jacks finance committee truthfully the man i actually deal with is an american attorney here named walton matt walton roared jack you know matthew senator inquired charlie stunned by the sound of the august public figure abruptly bellowing in his ear know him i may kill the prick for not talking to me sooner approximately five seconds after this conversation my phone erupted tell me judas he yelled is it true youre helping them out i want the goddamn truth and i want it now jack i finally recognized the voice helping who you know who you fucker our good friends the goddam japs thats who theyre jack calm down a second i interrupted its just possible this whole thing is some kind of scam not at all what it seems talk to me not over the phone client confidentiality but if youre coming up anytime soon im mad enough to give you a full rundown of all i know strictly off the record im scheduled in on the six oclock shuttle where can we meet how about the club i promise you an earful the centurion he inquired sourly i knew how he hated it jack wouldnt kill you to rub elbows now and then with an actual capitalist dont worry there wont be any photos to sully your reputation i suggested the place partly to pay my respects to a wounded ward after the days carnage and partly for jacks convenience it was a combined press hangout and new money convocation located just around the corner from his new york office in one of those old mansions right off fifth midtown theyd just begun allowing the fair sex to cross their hallowed doorstep after a lawsuit a move certain diehards felt signaled the curtain raiser on the wests decline for my own part id actually put up donna for membership as pan of the test case we eventually established that the centurions unwritten membership criteria were actually pretty simple in addition to being white and male you also needed to be either rich or wellknown being all four made you a shooin a couple of us fortunate enough to have friends on the circuit bench called in a few favors and arranged for a black female judge to hear the case the proceeding was over in time for lunch is eight okay done he said ill be there on the dot he was late as usual but i managed to pass the time it was enough just to sip a perrier and observe the shellshocked faces of golden boy brokers presently mainlining martinis down the bar fortunately the place was on the ground floor so nobody could take a dive out a high window but the crowd had all the insouciance of hookers working a salvation army convention i checked over the roomlots of designer suits topped off by long facesand wondered how many millions had been dropped that day by those present booze was flowing across the mahogany bar as if there were no tomorrow maybe there wasnt at a quarter to nine jack odonnell marched up the blue marble steps a man in from the war front odonnell was a big guy who looked every inch a senator right down to the thirtydollar haircut and the eighthundreddollar suit i think it was his overcompensation for being irish and being crapped on by the columbia university administration most of his days a soso academic hed blossomed as a politicianfirm handshake and steel eyeand had easily devastated the smoothtalking long island party hack the big money had thrown against him the man was a straight shooter who believed the purpose of capitalism was to make a better place for all americans not merely enrich the unscrupulous or crafty few as a result his senate harangues were a lonesome cry in the takeoverarbitrageleveragingexecutiveperk wilderness his contempt for overpaid investment bankers was exceeded only by his disdain for overpaid corporate ceos anyway we settled into the leather chairs of the back room while he ordered a medicinal scotch double after his nerves stabilized a bit i suggested he let me give him an informal rundown of what little i knew high goddam time he grimly extracted a notebook jack heres the mea culpa i now confess before god and you that ive been a very uneasy point man for an outfit that calls itself dai nippon international they have been playing a little game with interestrate futures and currency forwards in quantities that stagger the mind thus far however their activity has been strictly legal and right out there for everybody to watch i also tried to warn anybody who would listen consequently any of our financial analysts who didnt see this brouhaha coming a mile away has been suffering a severe rectalcranial inversion he snorted and pulled at his drink okay since you seem to know so much about this dai nippon outfit care to clue me in on whats down the road jack i think the answer is one nobodys figured then i delivered my brandnew theory he stared at me skeptically sipping at his drink good god youve gone off the deep end walton i always assumed it would happen someday jack from what i hear none of the big japanese securities dealers here will even pick up their phone what does that tell you theyre softening us up using the weapon the market dreads the most uncertainty what better way to terrify the street christ let somebody start a rumor the president has a toothache and they practically have to shut down trading matt nobodys going to believe your crazy scenario matter of fact i dont either its too wild ill tell you what most people are saying all the news shows tonight hauled out our doomsday economists lester thurow and his ilk to declare we had this one coming the consensus going around is the japanese are finally fed up hearing us bellyache about trade barriers so theyve decided to treat us to a pointed demonstration concerning exactly who needs who thats all japan now controls americas destiny but since a few people here still have the idea we won the last war tokyo just wants to make sure we get our history straightened out could be i answered but i still thought everybody was missing the forest for the trees then i went on to describe nodas building his highsecurity computer setup nobody would install an elaborate headquarters like that merely to get your attention he listened in uncharacteristic silence beginning to appear a little more convinced well lets run with your cockamamie theory a second he rattled his ice cubes a habit of his i always found distracting say something bigger is coming up and this is just the pregame warmup what can we do my suggestion that the president close down all our financial markets immediately to keep nodas hands off them was not received enthusiastically you want me to stand up in the senate and propose that his already ruddy cheeks were beginning to redden even more as he glared around the paneled room matt id be tarred and feathered by every stockholder in the country maybe so i said but what about nodas vast third avenue nerve center his supercomputer the uzis it had ominous portent tell you the truth jack im not even sure i should be talking to you after what happened today that guy scares hell out of me we ran through the known facts a couple of times more not getting any closer to agreeing on the big picture finally he summed up his own fears in my view we weathered the october crash because the fed still had some control over liquidity when money started disappearing out of the market they just printed more they countered deflation with inflation kept the dollar in balance this time though weve lost all three pillars under our financial housestocks bonds and the dollar theres nothing the government can do to stop this one at that moment there was a tap on my shoulder and i looked up to see eduardo the clubs recent attempt at hispanic affirmative action handing me a cordless phone then i remembered id set up things downtown to forward calls to the bar the next sounds in my ear were the mellifluous profanities of dr william henderson bill had just gotten off a plane after spending a few days loosening up at the sandy lane in barbados assaulting its reserves of sugar cane brandy and he was mad as hell his georgia mafia had been caught flatfooted why hadnt i warned him that the japs had scheduled this move surely i must have had an inkling he would have shorted the market and scored a pile i suggested he calm down that nobody me included had seen it coming whats more i had a strong feeling it was all what the hells next bill continued oblivious whats noda saying nothing here but speculation hes probably getting his beauty sleep at the moment but take some of your own advice friend and stand clear ive got a feeling theres less here and more than meets the eye dont repeat dont get the idea you can outguess matsuo noda i think hes pulling a number but bill interjected something brief and unrepeatable and rang off undoubtedly headed for consolation was that henderson jack asked then watched me nod bill had pitched in to help jack out of a few tight spots on the money front in appreciation of which odonnell had proposed him for the council of economic advisersand shortly thereafter forfeited all credibility with the administration these days he couldnt have gotten into the white house on a vfw tour well the mans got no idea when to keep his mouth shut with the press but hes nobodys idea of a fool what does he think this is all about sounds like hes just studying the tea leaves like everybody else jack sighed then rattled his cubes some more well if henderson cant figure out whats going on then nobody can that in itself ought to tell us theres a patch of slippery ice down the road my own guess is the japanese have decided to play a little poker with the american markets without having the damnedest idea of the consequences jack what if they do after we sat there gazing at the gilded plasterwork ceiling for a while we started getting caught up on old times he inquired what i thought the press would do to him if he married one of his staffers my guess was that a photo of washingtons most eligible divorce veteran at the altar once more would probably make the cover of people everybody loves a lover that possibility seemed to cheer him up a bit it was round about then probably close to tenthirty pm that another call came through this time i already had a feeling who it was and i momentarily considered not taking it but then why not let odonnell have the story straight from the source the caller was of course matsuo noda it must have been late morning japan time after a very long night what he inquired was my onthespot reading of the scene i dont know the phone had that same funny whine i remembered as though he had a private phone system worldwide maybe you should be telling me nodasan no surprise didnt seem particularly unsettled by the developments i assure you there is no cause for alarm mr walton the situation may seem temporarily unfortunate but i have long believed all things turn out for the best could have fooled me but while were all waiting for the silver lining to this cloud you could do everybody a favor and get your goddam securities dealers here to issue a statement clarifying their intentions mr waltonhe chuckledyou ascribe far too much influence to me i am merely a banker one of many in japan i have no control over what our institutions choose to do or not do i wish i could believe that well i suppose there are many things about dai nippon that need to be explained more fully i look forward to seeing you next week we can talk then upon which he advised me just to sit tight all further communications would be routed through their office uptown and with that dictum in place he suddenly had better things to do and said thanks for all my help there was the sound of some satellite bleeps then silence welcome to the brave new world i thought again i had this definite feeling the dni rodeo had just begun by then jack was nearing terminal exhaustion i passed along nodas cryptic refusal to lift a hand advised him to make a statement tomorrow that the us financial markets could be dangerous to everybodys health and helped him into a cab for his aides place uptown the evening was fizzling out with nobody left at the bar but regulars thus i went home alone to check in with amy and then drift off into a very unsettling dream my nightmare was over by morning americas was just beginning chapter thirteen funny thing about investor confidence often as not it relies more on faith than facts give it a little unsettling heat and it can just melt away belief turns to fear then blind panic insight number two the bigger you are the more scared you tend to get so what appeared to be a sudden japanese loss of conviction regarding the us treasurys ability to meet its standing obligations received close attention from the worlds bankers from zurich to hong kong the japanese securities outfits just kept dumping and nervous phone inquirers from locales as diverse as the white house and red square were all advised that everybody was in a meeting and will get back to you as a natural consequence the worlds major financial players succumbed to a terminal case of nerves when the bond markets finally reopened on wednesday treasurys thirtyyear issue had scooted up four full interest points there was still a market for uncle sams iouseverything on this planet will move for a pricebut buyers were wary they wanted their newly perceived risk sweetened considerably predictably rates on corporate and municipal bonds did a similar tango north leaving americas conservative investors wondering what hit them in fact a lot of scheduled corporate debt offerings were scuttled to await more settled times and lower rates the dollar also stayed on the critical list everybody was worried the us treasury might just rev up the printing presses to produce enough greenbacks to pay off all the foreigners who wanted their money back since paul tight money volckerwho probably would have thrown his robust torso onto the ink to prevent that from happeningwas now gone there was nobody at the fed with a real commitment to holding back the flood and the stock market people werent starting to call this black november for nothing a lot of players feared that the higher rates would hobble the economy a perfect excuse to head for the exits while the getting was good as henderson liked to observe psychology is a fundamental too the next day the dow sank another two hundred points the day after that a hundred more where had those sellers been two days before the fourth and fifth days it slowed heaved an audible sigh of exhaustion and sort of peered up out of the bunker to see if the bombing runs had let up the downward pressure was still evident but it was finally losing some of its steam yours truly did a lot of thinking as the week wore on while the country appeared to wobble on the brink of unprecedented disaster i also conferred now and then with jack odonnell and with henderson in between their appearances on tv chat shows although bills bearish reading of the nations estate had been vindicated well beyond what even he had envisioned i can report he took small pleasure in his newfound celebrity he was increasingly miserable over his own missed opportunities in the financial casino jack for his part had gained a profound appreciation of the helplessness of government to intervene when fear and greed seize the marketplace my personal ruminations on the situation turned out to be too machiavellian for anybody to entertain seriously question if you wanted to pull all your money out of the us is this how youd do it answer no way instead youd go about it gradually a little at a time in order not to stampede the markets and cause exactly what was happening now ergo i concluded this isnt real noda just wants every investor in the world to assume theres a japanese pullout underway but why the grandstand play sure hed made a pile but he didnt seem like a guy who had to sweat his mortgage payments nor did this kind of market manipulation require a building in midtown manhattan and a computer setup to rival norad headquarters something more had to be coming and the only thing i could think of was that nodas something had a lot to do with my profession this was not a welcome piece of prognostication to loose upon the world since the financial markets already had plenty of problems on their plate there wasnt all that much interest in speculating about the next course consequently nobody made the slightest attempt to man the ramparts for what was ahead our financial battleship had been stopped dead in the water and its engines disabled but nobody was even bothering to prime the guns this couldnt be an allout attack right wrong the stage was now set for nodas real move the following saturday i was summoned to dai nippons midtown fortress where i watched my crazy theory become reality before anybody in our shellshocked financial centers had time to digest what had happened matsuo nodahis dai nippon eighthundredyear funds underwritten through a syndicate of japanese banks and insurance companies led by the daiichi credit corporation ltd of tokyohit the beach in the days to come i did manage to assemble a rough outline of how noda pulled off his brilliant opening feint it was elegant and to savor it fully requires a quick peek at his reservesjapans bankbook start with personal savings the hundreds of billions being squirreled away by individual japanese then add to those monies the assets of japanese pension funds private savings organizations with several hundred billion dollars to lend out next come insurance companies and corporations similarly awash in loose cash taken together the total amount of excess capital in japan is now well over five trillion dollars if all those zeros befuddle you as much as they do me try thinking of it like this a trillion dollars is the size of the annual us budget so if the japanese regulators opened the floodgates and let all that money roll its citizens have the ready bucks to finance our governments entire budgetlockheed stockpiles and pork barrelfor at least five years using just whats in their mattresses as it happens all this japanese cash has become an important nay indispensable component of the american financial scene we and the japanese are like an old married couple theyre the wife who scrimps and saves were the husband who borrows and squanders the middlemen who rifle her purse and ship the proceeds to us are increasingly japanese investment firms at least half a dozen major japanese securities dealers with offices in new york run big bond departments the foremost of these is of course nomura securities international the worlds largest brokerage house having aced out merrill lynch with over two hundred billion dollars in customer accounts nomura is now a primary dealer in us treasury issues meaning they can buy directly from the government and sell to their clients and since treasuries pay several interest points better in return than japans miserly savings accounts their customers back home think theyre getting a terrific deal little wonder japanese investors finance a full third of americas budget overdrafts these days another major player is daiwa securities america which also underwrites federal paper on its own nor should we overlook nikko securities and yamaichi securities both handling money in the tens of billions these outfits and others are well past the beachhead stage of entry into the world capital markets theyre entrenched theyre big and they know how to play hardball were they involved in nodas assault nobody ever knew for sure but you figure it out banks as it happens the biggest one in the world is japanese the daiichi kangyo bank ltd of tokyo has unceremoniously reduced citicorp to second banana rounding out the top five worldwide are fuji sumitomo and mitsubishi and worldwide means everywhere japan controls ten percent of the us banking business a quarter of all british banking of the ten largest banks in the sovereign state of california four are japanese japan in brief has become banker to the world with more ready money than anybody else and it also has a battalion of financial samurai who know the game what makes these japanese players especially powerful is the kind of bucks they represent its called hot moneycash lent out shortterm and therefore subject to immediate withdrawal instead of tying up their overseas bankroll for years they stick to offshore investments that can be called in tomorrow at home japan invests for the long horizon but abroad the bulk of the money is short hot money since foreign investors normally pick up well over half of a given treasury refunding the paralysis when japan began recalling its hot money thereby spooking buyers worldwide was as predictable as the sunrise matsuo noda didnt have to be a rhodes scholar to realize how much mileage thered be in a big japanese selloff program and a no comment from his dealers heres how he orchestrated the details apparently it had all been very japanese very consensus a few phone calls then a lot of meetings over green tea later on some late nights with sake noda thanks to his new clout had been in the drivers seat from the start the money managers in tokyo were all feeling the heat over demands by investors that they participate in the multiple eighthundredyear funds hed floated all across japan people were starting to ask whether their savings were out there waving the flag too a lot of those managers were starting to get edgy so noda thoughtfully struck a deal a little consensus okay hold your monies but lets get organized when the next treasury collection plate comes by dont roll over any more shortterm us tbills and dont take a piece of the next sale of long bonds in fact thats the day you begin to divest staggering losses no problem i just happen to have everybodys portfolio insulated with futures contracts sell away and even when the price plummets nobodys gonna lose a yen in fact you can have a piece of the currency windfall ive set up apparently everybody shook hands on it or whatever they do in japan nowadays consequently none of the big japanese houses in new york had to take a lot of risk the sellers were covered by nodas rate contracts which i later discovered hed passed along at cost to anybody who needed them the rest he sold himself for a hefty profit so in the course of his play he incidentally raised several billions in additional operating capital for dai nippon while fully protecting the home team when the dust had finally settled it turned out he didnt actually liquidate very much treasury paper after all he didnt need to in fact japan dumped only about eight percent of its holdings if you think about it a minute you realize they couldnt possibly have hoped to divest everything they had in dollars what would they do with all that cash loan it to brazil veterans of world finance will tell you there were already precedents for this kind of japanese muscle back in the mid eighties nomura securities had unsheathed its financial sword and totally controlled the eurobond markets for about a fortnight they were just letting everybody know they were in town so there was nothing particularly unprecedented about a little number whereby a handful of japanese banks and securities firms could by concerted action bring the us financial system to its knees although id been convinced from the very first that matsuo noda had engineered the whole move i had no hard proof besides what was i supposed to do no laws were broken he was playing strictly by the rules so i just took cover like everybody else and watched the marketplace disintegrate my main preoccupation was a growing suspicion that noda was now moving up his battery of guns for the next round of shelling i was right his treasury selloff had merely been a demonstration of firepower its effectiveness must have given confidence that his beachhead was secured since he came ashore at the end of the week to take personal command of the real landing he and his general staff hit town quietly and with no fanfare on thursday spent friday in a strategy session and on saturday took over the computerized command hq on third avenue that afternoon tanaka called and ordered me very politely but curtly to assemble my records and come uptown the operation was being consolidated and nodasan wanted me coordinated from now on i would be working out of their offices this was it just what id been waiting for at last i could confront the bastard oneonone no way was i going to be part of the big assault i saw directly ahead my first look at the revised operation uptown confirmed my worst fears the technical analysts had been replaced by a new set of troops money men open collars were gone supplanted by a lot of businessschool types wearing thin black ties tanakas office had been moved off to the side the corner office now belonged to dai nippons fourstar commanding general matsuo noda after id cleared security thats where i was led mr walton how good to see you again he looked up from a printout his silver hair perfectly groomed i do hope today is convenient for you this is going to be brief i ignored the chair he rose to adjust for me im only here to advise you that my participation is officially terminated as of this moment ill be sending you a final invoice next week you can find yourself another attorney but your work has scarcely begun he appeared to be mildly puzzled as though id just made a small misstatement about the weather or some such we expect your participation to be crucial surely youre joking i was turning to leave mr walton he shifted the printout around and shoved it across the desk contrary to what you may presume we are here to help this country you might wish to look over our program for the near term this ive got to see i came back and studied it for a few seconds then stared back at him impossible i finally realized he was serious whatever youre thinking ill tell you right now you dont have a chance these outfits have lawyers hundreds of them ah but thats why you are on our staff this is your specialty he smiled remember the book of five rings by the swordsman miyamoto musashi in it he describes the three kinds of attack there is the ken no sen where you move first and catch your opponent unprepared next is the tai no sen whereby your initial move occurs a split second after your opponents and finally there is the taitai no sen in which you and he attack at the same instant what has happened up until today might be likened to the ken no sen we have made sure that nothing was anticipated very soon however we will have to move to the tai no sen responding with lightning speed to the moves of those who would thwart us miyamoto musashi declared correctly that if you are attacked with force you must counterattack with even greater force and thereby upset momentarily your opponents rhythm that moment can mean victory but only if you are totally prepared he leaned back we must be totally prepared why in hell would i want to help you i guess you didnt hear me ive just resigned i turned for the door besides nobody could pull off what youre planning youre going to have battalions of attorneys moving against you i expect that he stopped smiling but that area is your responsibility now mr walton a good swordsman does not think he acts intuitively and if i refuse you cannot possibly try me only you can handle this mr walton betray us and you may well witness the disappearance of america as an industrial nation the time is now or never that zinger gave me pause he meant it but before i had a chance to tell him he was completely crazy he went on to sketch out what he claimed was his objective how he planned to address the american crisis and resolve it let me tell you my first impression of matsuo nodas scenario it was legal it was legit and it wasas joannas teenage niece used to describe notable phenomenatotally fucking awesome whats more he wanted me to stay on as tailgunner the truth i felt the disorientation of a kid whod been fooling around in the soap box derby suddenly being handed a slot in the indianapolis the most astonishing part of all was i had the feeling he just might pull it off youre right i should have said no not on your life this is way out of my league never in a million years instead i said id think about it good he said why didnt i stick around till monday and get a feeling for the operation i didnt shake his hand i just walked out and poured myself a cup of green tea from the huge urn there in the middle of the floor walton you idiot how did you get yourself into this which is when i spotted a sporty looking lady way across on the other side of the floor over by the climatecontrolled nec mainframe something about her seemed vaguely familiar definitely not dni staff wearing jeans dark hair in a nice designer cut handled herself like a mover not to mention a worldclass bottom inside those tight shapely calvins from all appearances she actually seemed to be secondincommand she was reading the riot act to tanaka about something to do with the computer had the selfimportant little fucker bobbing and weaving who was that hadnt seen her around here before well now no time like the present to head on over and check into this a fellow gaijin could be shell explain what in hells going on is noda real suddenly she turned around saw me and stopped i stopped we both just stood there trying to remember she hit pay dirt first but i was only microseconds behind want to know my first thought my very first thought matsuo noda you son of a bitch youre even smarter than id given you credit for youve hired the best the very best is this how you pick up your women these days matt given up on vegetable stands she was walking toward me wearing a smile i tried to grin back how are you matthew good to see youve still got your hair well most of it tam richardson i dont believe this now i know it all is a dream please tell me you were kidnapped none of this is really happening right its just a very big very bad dream well all wake up tomorrow and go to the beach welcome aboard partner she stuck out her hand its going to be a wild trip no kidding i looked her over as i took her hand nice and warm time had treated her well very well how long have you known noda less than a month she was checking me over too wonder how i was doing how long have you been helping him it occurred to me that we both should have been using that classic hooker response when the guy asks his young companion how long shes been in her particular field of endeavor and she replies long enough to know better few months now noda is pretty impressive i tried to sound casual not to mention persuasive that he is well lets have a toast to winning this i turned to the urn how about some tea professor love it tam lets just hope these guys dont suddenly decide to eat us alive i passed it over what do you think our chances of survival are that one startled her i got the impression she was half thinking the same thing then she managed a thin laugh well eat them first if they try you still talk tough i always told you you should have been a lawyer but she was right once the cards are dealt you play to win which is exactly what i planned to do since my own part was still down the road that weekend i just sat in their offices watching spellbound as noda and dr tamara richardson reviewed the data and put together the financial details next a lot of coded telexes were sent out to pile up somewhere in tokyo with instructions for routing of the funds after id digested his opening move i did have occasion to ask the boss a few pointed questions such as wasnt he at all nervous that wall street might rebound before he could get rolling he replied correctly as usual that the total collapse in the financial markets would last for a while even though the dollar was still down for the count over forty percent he figured only the most intrepid foreign speculators would go plunging into the american stock market looking for bargains as for american investors most of them including the institutions were still in shock he rightly forecast that the herd mentality of the street hadnt been repealed war stories of were going around and nobody wanted to make the textbooks as a fool better a little profit forgone than more money lost the mutual fund managers most of whom had been caught with their pants at halfmast were devoting their energies that weekend to composing creative explanations events monday proved him to be essentially on target there was an eerie quiet over the financial landscape everybody was waiting for somebody else to try breathing life back into the corpse then a few analysts noticed something peculiar anonymous buy orders were coming in more and more for stocks in the sector hardest hit high tech maybe it was bargain hunters but the buyers werent any of the growth mutual funds that might have been expected to lead the action in fact many of those hotshot managers were relieved to part with some of the dogs theyd ridden down that long lonesome decline of the week before gradually the prices of certain securities began to edge up in this early thin trading enticing more and more holders to sell on strength what issues first off anything to do with computers of course there werent all that many hardware manufacturers left around by then after the shakeout and mergers of the mideighties but somebody was buying heavily into the few that remained they were also actively purchasing little software outfits those stocks had taken a heavy beating over the past week so prices were at an alltime low for most other industries they started to nibble at were telecommunications aerospace biotechnology they seemed to be looking for outfits with substantial r ampd operations the focus was on creativity growth sectors the sunrise industries of course what this mysterious new buyer was really doing was snapping up outfits loaded with labs and phds dr richardson and my new client matsuo noda had dni acquiring companies short on competent management and market share but long on research innovationthe one thing we were still halfway good at looked at differently what dai nippon was really buying was underused brainpower the american smarts currently going to waste thanks to inept corporate management explanations began to sprout all over the placefrom the heard on the street column in the journal to dan dorfman a guy with a bloodhounds nose for wall street shenanigans but the hard truth was nobody could put it together who could have the play was too ambitious even to imagine you guessed it with the trillions and trillions now at its disposal japan was about to take charge of americas future chapter fourteen the task ahead can be described very simply i was going to help dai nippon acquire controlling stock positions in a bevy of ineptly managed american hightech companies and she was going to be in charge of turning them around i was dnis takeover artist tam was the fixit expert that probably sounds a bit ambitious on everybodys part but after watching the dai nippon juggernaut for a couple of days i knew one thing for sure wed have plenty of heavy backup why did i agree to ride shotgun for matsuo nodas save america project because if he meant what he said such a program was long overdue american industry was in trouble and it was hurting a lot of good hardworking people who didnt deserve to be hurt worse still this wasnt some random act of god it was largely the result of selfserving corporate management most occupiers of the executive suites these days were too busy merging and acquiring and leveraging to do what stockholders thought they were paying them for building industry and creating american jobs well maybe thats an overstatement they had kept drexel burnhams junkbond cowboys working overtime in the mideighties american corporations were spending two and three times more on mergers and acquisitions than on research and development most industrialists here no longer cared to try making anything as oldfashioned as competitive products they preferred to make deals and sell imports the net result was that america the worlds major economic locomotive was veering off the track and seriously in danger of taking everybody else in the world along with it thats where matsuo noda came in part of the arrangement hed made with the japanese institutions putting up the funds was that he would be given proxy to exercise all voting rights face it he had a pretty impressive performance record overseeing the longrange planning and investment of wellrun corporations so after id helped dai nippon acquire control of a long list of poorly managed companies he and tam richardson were planning to move in clear out the deadwood and lay down priorities for restructuring she was dai nippons technical director for all us operations which meant she was going to head up the team on the newly evacuated floor just above the financial sectionnodas management samurai enough theory heres how it actually went on friday the story was finally broken by the wall street journal a little squib in whats news with a short twocolumn analysis on page the piece revealed that all the heavy new activity building in the hightech sector of the market represented buys being coordinated by a new japanese investment concern this sudden unexpected program of foreign investment was heralded at first as a salubrious omen refuting those doomsayers who were claiming the world had lost confidence in the us in fact if anything it was proof that overseas enthusiasm was actually increasing japans previous practice of focusing on debt instruments was at best passive investment but buying heavily into a sector of the economy that appeared weak was something else entirely it was a rousing endorsement of americas prospects to be fair there was still a modest case to be made in that direction our hightech sector wasnt all struggling high fliers operating out of some onestory cinder block on route or the washington beltway america had plenty of solid industry in high techcomputers aerospace office machineryand american laboratories and universities were the envy of the world the problem lay with the downside wed lost our lead in electronics drugs scientific instruments plastics communications equipment its a long list in fact americas overall trade balance in hightech products had actually gone negative shrunk from a twentyfive billion dollar surplus as recently as the ignored question therefore given the direction things were headed why were the japanese suddenly supposed to be so impressed the markets initial euphoria didnt last long however by the end of the second week the sec was sniffing the air and the lunch talk downtown from the amex traders at harrys to the expenseaccount crowd at historic fraunces tavern was focused on what appeared to be a major shift in japans investment strategy now that the stock market was in shambles they werent just dabbling anymore they were cashing in on the fire sale hand over fist thus the streets early cheering melted into apprehension japan had already taken apart our debt and currency markets turned them upside down and scored a bundle now noda had wall street looking over its shoulder and reminiscing about the good old days when all it had to worry about was rich crazy arabs when it became clear that dai nippon was assaulting the us securities markets with highspeed computers and a checkbook that just kept coming there werent all that many wisecracks about camels and tents wall street however merely counts it doesnt think the real disquiet was reserved for corporate boardrooms take it as a given that when the securities and exchange commission reports some ten twenty or thirty percent of your companys stock has just been swallowed by a cashrich japanese raider your attention can focus most exquisitely in a word matsuo noda was the talk of industrial america more to the point and exactly what he had expected the boards and ceos of the companies being bought were beginning to be scared shitless a major player with seemingly bottomless pockets was gobbling up heavy blocks of their publicly traded shares worse still nobody had the slightest inkling why what all those entrenched ceos didnt realize in their wildest paranoia was that sevenfigure salaries and cushy executive perks were about to go the way of cadillac tail fins world competition not executive compensation would be the new game playtime was over america was about to get serious again my early suspicions concerning my role in nodas design had been precisely on the mark i was indeed the freelance gunslinger he wanted by his side when the companies he was aiming at started to shoot back which they surely would needless to say if his plan was ever allowed to reach the courts it would create a virtual living trust for half the corporate lawyers in the land hed be in litigation through the twentyfirst century as managements fought to the last stockholders dollar to keep their jobs enter matt walton time for some samuraistyle legal swordsmanship the rules if youre ceo of a company and somebody starts buying up a major chunk of your stock with the intent of taking you over youve got roughly four basic ways to stop him the first is to try and bribe that buyer to go away paying him a ransompolitely called greenmailto sell his holdings and disappear more than one corporate raider youve read about in the papers has made millions in a couple of weeks using that very play the drawbacks of trying to buy off a potential acquirer are its expensive and maybe he really does plan to eat you in which case it wont work anyway matsuo noda was in that category a second popular means to thwart a hostile takeover is to go out and find somebody else to buy you first the proverbial white knight ideally this friendly buyer should be too big to be taken over himself and willing to let you keep your playpen a third technique to stop somebody from acquiring a controlling chunk of your stock is to jack up the price usually by offering to buy it yourself float some junk bonds sell off a few divisions do anything that will raise cash and then offer the shareholders more than the raider is willing to bid this can be very expensive but if youre a ceo with millions in compensation every year why should you care if your stockholders company is leveraged to the brink of ruin youve still got your job and your goodies its used a lot the fourth and most fashionable way these days to stop hostile mergers is to try and make yourself unmergeable to do that you get your board of directors to vote a poison pill what this does is make sure that any company that swallows you is going to be ingesting a piranha that will eat said companys own guts instead the newest twist on this is to use phony bonds with a socalled flipover provision a killer pill invented by a clever new york law operation i wont name but whose initials might be wlr ampk their game is as follows in order to protect yourself you invent some convertible bonds and stash them away somewhere ready then should a raiding company start acquiring your stock or make an unauthorized tender offer to your shareholders you hand out these little bombs to everybody who owns your shares if this unfriendly company is then unlucky enough to actually acquire you those convertibles flip over into the stock of that buyer your stockholders suddenly have the right to exchange their funny paper for huge discounted chunks of real stock in the acquiring companywhich would naturally be ruined should that happen and usually just for good measure you also vote through a few golden parachutes for you and all your cronies giving everybody in the executive suite severance pay in the tens of millions those were the stakes now a lot of outfits suddenly found themselves being bought by a mysterious japanese entity named dai nippon international what were they going to do at first of course everybody just assumed ndi was merely angling for a little greenmail no such luck after a couple of days went by and we hadnt returned anybodys phone call they knew that wasnt it next a few went looking for a white knight with more money than dni a tough assignment not surprisingly however most corporate managers very quickly decided to call a board meeting and ram through a poison pill i got more than a few phone calls at my downtown office from ceos wanting to know if i could pitch in and help them stave off what looked like an unfriendly japanese buyup i had to say sorry fellows im unavailable but why not give it your best shot and try the old pill most of them did they had no option really which suited me fine the time was late fridaythe afternoon was gorgeous sunny and crispand the place was nodas office naturally he understood all about poison pills so he knew the problem what he wanted to hear was our solution id like to try something thats never been done before a different battle plan i glanced out at the blue sky and wished i was already in st croix on holiday with amy however i think its possibly just unconventional enough to fly it has to be legal mr walton noda leaned back in his chair waiting it is but in order to lay the groundwork well first need to set up a string of dummy corporations any particular state he was listening closely now his mind clicking away i was never sure what the man was thinking but i figured hed probably seen it all before that old standby delaware should do fine though you might want to consider going for some offshore taxhaven places if only because the paperwork is minimal in the caribbean id recommend the turks and caicos islands maybe the cayman islands then theres bermuda or the bahamas or the channel islands if you really want to get esoteric why not vanuatuused to be the new hebridesin the south pacific im familiar with world geography mr walton he was deadpan a joke fair enough these dummy corporations of course will have no assets i understand he smiled and ran his fingers through his silver hair doubtless already miles ahead of me absolutely no problem please proceed while those corporations are being set up you continue buying stock in whatever companies you need to control making sure in all cases that you acquire just enough to deliberately trigger their poisonpill mechanism we force them to issue their flipover bonds they cant stop the process since its always set up to be automatic after a certain percentage of stock has been acquired not even the boards of directors can revoke it yes mr walton im aware of that he didnt seem the slightest bit ruffled by my unorthodox opener well let me elaborate the reason we want to trigger their poison pill first is so that nobody can later come in as a white knight and save them theyre totally isolated theyll have made themselves into sitting ducks very good he leaned back was he really that far ahead of me while thats happening you sell the stock acquired thus far to one of the dummy outfits weve set up in return for debt paper which puts dnl at arms length and untouchable after that you lend that dummy corporation the rest of the millions or billions necessary to acquire a controlling interest in the company taking back as collateral more junk bonds at absurdly usurious rates that makes it a financial leper but you dont care youre merely lending yourself the money this paper corporation is all that can be touched when the acquired companys poison bonds flip over so instead of being convertible into the stock of some cashrich corporation the way they were intended those flipbonds are going to give their holders a piece of some offshore phone booth with zero assets and enough debt to choke a horse theyre worthless paper and youre in the clear he smiled which means our program can proceed on schedule dai nippon will be totally insulated from their poison pills like the guy who sells his house and boat to his company and then lets it file chapter bankruptcy in order to protect his personal assets from creditors nobody can lay a glove on you mr waltonhe leaned back a twinkle in his dark eyesthats exactly why i knew you were right for us you have an intuitive grasp of tactics if you do this therere going to be a lot of unhappy unemployed lawyers in this town most regrettable some of them might even have to go out and find productive work he rose and shook my hand youve destroyed the prospect of years of legal roadblocks in a single stroke its elegant it was sun tzu and miyamoto musashi would definitely have approved but there still had to be more an unexpected opening is not enough in itself it needs an equally deft followup bushido the way of the sword teaches that you should first surprise your antagonist and then you must confound him both the initial attack and the carrythrough are crucial to success among other things that meant nodas mechanism for calling a board meeting of the companies hed be acquiring had to be instantaneous without the usual niceties this setup should do the job but only if its used with finesse otherwise the whole system gets buried in paperwork what do you mean you have to be fast and flexible once youve taken ownership of a company youve got to gain immediate control over its board of directors in order to block any and all countermoves i understand do you im talking about the ability to call an executive session out of the blue the kesa stroke of the sword the power to cut a ceo in half before he can blink no time for consensus and the usual japanese niceties he stood quietly thinking at last he spoke in other words i must be able to convene the board at a moments notice is that the essence of what you are saying nothing else is going to work very well after we have a commanding stock position we can institute the necessary changes good remember though thats still merely half the battle besides being able to call board meetings you need full authority to institute a shareholders vote which in this case will consist of nothing more than you signing your name perfectly reasonable it is but it also means youve got to be available to me at all times can i rely on that he turned and strolled to the window pensively that may not always be possible then youve got a potential problem he revolved back and studied me a second finally taking the bait there is of course one very simple solution i can merely assign you power of attorney allowing you to act in my name if i cannot be reached that would do it but youd be handing over a lot of authority i envision no difficulty he looked me over with the self assurance of a tiger contemplating a haunch of beef i have every reason to believe you would always act in dnis best interest mr walton it was possible he knew a few things i didnt on the other hand maybe matsuo noda had just overreached taken too much for granted whichever it was the maneuvering just completed had been one small step for tam and matthew walton should we ever need them id just conned matsuo noda into giving me duplicates of the keys to his kingdom it was our protection and in a way my secret price for putting our heads into dai nippons noose then it looks like we have everything we need to move forward i nodded excellent upon which i absented his office safety net in place the play was on which brings us to tam richardson if my approach to this new job was a little unconventional what about the college prof who showed up in jeans as she readied to renovate corporate america one thing we suited each other it was a tag team made in heaven after id pried open the door to the companies dni was buying she was going to roll in guns blazing and shove everybody against the wall let me add one important distinction however whereas i may have been wary even slightly skeptical tam was definitely the idealist she was by god going to get this country moving again america was once more going to lead she declared not follow no defensive fortress america claptrap hers would be nothing less than a fullscale assault intended to win back and keep a solid manufacturing base here toetotoe with the world since no overall american program existed to rescue industries now being killed by foreign competition she was going to do it herself create a coordinated battle plan for our strategic sectors backed by nodas japanese billions she was about to try and redeem this countrys future leading us back to number one she also was quick to add she had no intention of merely copying japans famous management techniques japanese industry she insisted hadnt invented longterm planning sound capital investment dedication what they did over there these days was what the us used to do the american work ethic was alive and well it was just temporarily on the wrong side of the globe she was about to bring it home again maybe she could one major impediment at least would be out of the way since the companies dai nippon was taking over would no longer have to answer to a lot of fickle fund managers every three months they could start investing for the longer term also a lot of unnecessary fat was going to be sliced out of upper management if things went as planned dr tamara richardson and dai nippon were about to become the ruthless architects of a new corporate america unless well there seemed no reason not to take things at face value at least for now dnis new industrial management section on the twelfth floor had already begun filling up with young tokyo university graduates guys who embodied the work ethic in human guise they meant business nobody was sipping coffee and critiquing last nights rerun of dynasty i got the definite impression one of the unsmiling whiz kids in nodas handpicked cadre could chew up about five american mbas for breakfast tam currently had them working overtime putting together a reorganization plan for an outfit in boston one of their new acquisitions which i guess id better just call xyz the previous week dai nippon had purchased some twentyfour percent of its stock presently at a historic low and she was planning to make the company her showcase turnaround stock in hand shed buckled down with her new staff and using dnis analytical machinery confirmed some alarming suspicions it turned out xyz was practically a terminal case living at the moment off its real estate assets which were being systematically dribbled away to mask heavy losses layoffs would be next by thursday of the second week however shed put together a restructuring including some painful austerity that might just salvage the company and its american jobs she went home that night feeling quite proud of herself and friday she flew up to boston for her first official conference with xyzs chief executive officer since a quarter of a companys shares gives the holder reasonably high recognition the ceo was understandably nervous about who exactly had acquired a fourth of his company inside of a week and a half he appeared at logan with his rolls limo to receive dr richardson personally she explained right off that she was there merely to pass along a few of dnis recommendations she took one look at the rolls and added that for example one of the first was going to be to divest all limos forthwith along with the new fifteenmilliondollar gulfstream iv hed bought for weekend fishing trips down in the keys and direct the proceeds toward capital investment from there on things progressed pretty much as might be expected by the time they reached his paneled office she had been obliged to explain that his options were either to get in line or to watch dni pick up another thirty percent of his companys otc shares then march him and his golden parachute past a stockholders vote they would call to review his career options after that she had claim to his unalloyed attention it was a tough friday after she flew back late she dropped by the office to pick up a few things and fill me in on how it went good youre still here she popped her head around my office door who won the christians or the lions want to hear about it she came on in and dropped her briefcase on the desk wouldnt miss it for the world matt you should have seen the look on that mans face she clicked open the case and pulled out the action plan shed developed for xyz she was exhausted but still wired these ceos forget its shareholders who own the companies and pay their salaries they start thinking theyre little caesars hey those are the kinds of operators who used to be my clients believe me i know the type she then proceeded to give me the rundown outfit xyz specialized in hightech widgets it sold in the us latin america and europe problem their widgets cost too much broke down more than they should and consequently folks didnt tend to buy them the way they once did as a result xyz had dropped about five million last quarter and unbeknownst to its workers was currently on the verge of closing two of its three us plants and exporting the assembly operation someplace where it could exploit twodollar labor a move that would tank just over a thousand american jobs management says gee thats tragic and awards itself another yearend financial tribute dr richardson had just dropped a bomb in the playpen first off she told them xyzs damned widgets cost too much not because american workers are overpaid but because its assembly plants were a candidate for the smithsonian therefore starting immediately shortterm profits as well as dividends and all management compensation would be slashed and the resulting capital together with a new offering of long term corporate equities would be invested in automating its facilities and retraining workers there would in fact only be workers in future since all freeloading middle managers attorneys and drones with titles such as administrative assistant were to be terminated she gave them a list henceforth she went on management would begin planning ten years ahead not three months xyz would concern itself with world competition then not now and it would develop a substantially more diversified product line to cushion slumps as part of that shift it would double the budget for r ampd immediately and expand the lab innovation would once again be brought to the product stage fast and adapted quickly to world markets xyzs new focus would be on making its market share grow in the decade ahead which also meant cracking down on quality and halving the current customerbedamned response time on deliveries and service concerning those last items product managers would now be required to address customers complaints personally she figured that in itself would turn around xyzs substantial quality control debacle overnight finally there would be an immediate crash program to rectify xyzs costly illusion that english was the worldwide language of business these days she explained the language of business is the one your customer speaks accordingly all xyzs overseas operatives would be required to enroll in intensive language training now including formal study of the history and social customs of their territory sounds like you let him have it with both barrels keep on like this and the us of a may never be the same thats the idea one company down and about three thousand to go whats that saying about a journey of miles and miles starting with the first step well shed taken the step the future lay ahead hey can i buy you a drink i was winding up the day the week youve earned it like nothing better she was repacking her briefcase matt im having the time of my life all the things ive always wanted to do this is like a fantasy come true were going to pull this off wait and see could be i was switching off the lights in my office tell you something though doctor i keep wondering what will happen when noda gets through with us thoughts she glanced back well after japan takes over half the companies in this country and starts running them right then what we were headed for the security doors but maybe we ought to talk about that some other time and place ill think about it tomorrow just now im bushed tomorrow in case youve lost count is saturday dont know about you but im taking the day off the hell with japanese business hours my daughter comes this weekend we were saluted by heavies in the security airlock then the doors opened matter of fact were going to eat somewhere down in soho tonight care to join us be warned itll be mostly soy byproducts and brown rice id love to meet her she looked at me matthew walton with a daughter my god she laughed sorry matt but you really dont seem the father type amys mother said approximately the same thing as she was packing her bags but im now undergoing intensive onthejob father training fact is id planned to knock off around christmas and take her down to our place in the islands though now im not sure therell be time sounds very fatherly you should go im still hoping to i looked her over again well the hell with it why mince words tell me tam hows your love life these days she burst out laughing again you havent changed a bit not at all spare the commentary okay just stick to the question excuse me counselor the honest answer is its nonexistent which you surely must know since im here every night till midnight just as you are she examined me pointedly matthew could this conceivably be construed as a proposition to a horny bonetired woman in her moment of mental fatigue it might be a tentative gesture in that direction im a slow mover you always were she finished buttoning her coat what times dinner ill pick up amy and buzz you give us an hour think shell like me some stranger competing for dads attention if she does itll be a first i pushed the down button on the elevator guess what matthew walton barely got a word in edgewise the entire night then around eleven in the cab headed home amy whispered to me she thought dr richardson was kinda neat was she gonna be my new girlfriend tell you its not always simple learning to be a father chapter fifteen over the next couple of weeks i began to wonder if the scenario wasnt going a little too smoothly everything about nodas setup seemed surprisingly pat the answers came too easily was it all really what it seemed i should also add that in the fortnight since tarns first contact with americas shellshocked industrialists the situation had not gone unnoticed in washington tuesday of the second week jack odonnell called and left a message downtown with emma asking if i could arrange a meeting for him with the elusive matsuo noda although id tried to keep jack informed as to developments he still wanted to confront americas new age maker facetoface walton he said when i got back to him i just heard your guys too busy to meet the press but maybe hed chat with a close longtime friend of his american attorney thats me in case you dont recognize the description why not try and get me in to see him youre dreaming jack i told him that a us senator was about the last person matsuo noda would be interested in meeting just now dont hold your breath but ill bring it up and see what he says and what do you know noda declared that nothing would please him more naturally there had to be a few ground rules about confidentialitythis was after all a delicate corporate situationbut otherwise hed be delighted to chat you could have knocked me over with a feather thus around two pm thursday jack odonnell arrived at the new twelfthfloor operation ready to get the truth or by god know the reason why after he made his way past our uzi outfitted reception i brought him on through the floor and introduced him to dr richardson jack knew of her writings and hit the ground running asking who why when where etc but before he could get any real answers noda appeared and took over odonnell confided later that his first impression of matsuo noda matched perfectly my description of the manevery bit central castings image of the incharge japanese honcho after the usual routine pleasantries jack said hed like to record their talk noda politely demurred saying recording instruments stifled his spontaneity then proceeded to laud jacks own articles and speeches urging american industry to get its house in order senator jack odonnell he declared was a visionary american statesman jack accepted this praise warily then asked if he could maybe have a peek at the computer operation on the floor below the analytical armory id told him about again noda begged off claiming hed be honored to guide the esteemed senators tour personally but surely theyd both prefer to postpone that until such time as they had the leisure to review the operation in detail jack sensed and i did too that he was getting a polite runaround so he decided to get down to business he clicked open his briefcase and took out a notebook mr noda he began theres been considerable speculation in washington this past couple of weeks regarding the specific intent of japans sudden heavy involvement in americas hightech sector my subcommittee has monitored foreign investment here for a number of years and frankly ive never seen anything remotely like whats now underway id appreciate an informal briefing unless you wish to open the regrettable possibility of a formal subpoena to appear before our subcommittee whereupon jack received the first whoosh of what soon blossomed into a roomful of aerosol bullshit noda started with some malarkey about the great tradition of economic cooperation between our peoples advanced to balderdash about japans desire to share her resources with the worlds less fortunate then outdid himself with tripledistilled crapola about the timeless trust and regard his countrys ordinary citizens cherished in their hearts for our christian nation which had merely torchbombed and nuked them a few decades past worst of all jack had to sit there and listen ive never seen the guy so uncomfortable clearly noda intended to give him pure tatemae soothing generalities that added up to zip the man was by god going to do exactly what he wanted all of which was perfectly legal so he didnt really see any point in drawing a picture for the us senate finally jack just closed his notebook let me put this differently i understand that your objectives are not merely acquisition but also an attempt to rejuvenate us business beginning i take it with the lackluster segments of our hightech sector we hope to offer suggestions from time to time that may prove helpful noda just sat there like a sphinx perhaps i can offer an example as you doubtless know senator japanese firms build plants overseas these days primarily to be more competitive in those foreign markets you americans however are moving your manufacturing abroad now mainly to compete with foreign goods here it home in your own market you appear to think it as comparable but of course it is not what you are doing is exporting your own jobs your strategy is defensive ours is offensive jack looked him squarely in the eye quite frankly i must tell you that not everyone in washington these days trusts japans offensive in international trade i for one would be very interested in knowing exactly why japan has chosen to invest billions of dollars in keeping americas manufacturing alive particularly when so much of it is competitive with your own yes senator i realize you americans prize frankness he wasnt giving an inch very well quite honestly no one in japan believes it is in the interest of the free world to allow your industrial base to continue its current decline our economic condition is linked to yours like the vital organs of siamese twins we cannot afford to let you atrophy for one thing you are our only defense shield since we have none of our own i might also add though it is a comparatively lesser concern you are japans primary customer so what youre proposingif youll permit me to paraphraseis to take certain of our strategic industries the ones in trouble by the neck and institute the management investment and research necessary to keep them competitive noda just smiled dai nippon expects to offer occasional advice in the spirit of friendly cooperation which is why he went on i am so happy to have this opportunity to review our program with someone such as yourself your understanding of americas industrial malaise has not gone unnoticed by those japanese who take the longer view who worry about world economic stability jack tugged at his silk tie and nodded his thanks then noda continued you will be pleased to know i have been in contact with the japanese trade organizations that have political action committees or pacs as you call them in washington last year we distributed over fifty million dollars at least if you believe the senate foreign relations committees staffers in an effort to clarify misunderstandings about japans trade and investment position here he smiled that averages out to about a million dollars per state to take a somewhat clinical view of course i will try to use my influence to see what our pacs can do to help you next fall mr noda your expression of support is naturally appreciated jack was turning politician again however you should be aware of section e of the federal election campaign act which states that no foreign national shall make a contribution or an implied promise to make a contribution in connection with any federal public office i dont think this discussion is proper that law says nothing about pacs of duly incorporated american subsidiaries of foreignowned organizations senator for example sony of america and a coalition of japanese investors recently contributed hundreds of thousands to legislators of florida and california to encourage the defeat of those states unfair unitary taxes on foreignowned companies sometimes its necessary to remind your federal and state governments that japanese investment can be very problematical in an uncongenial environment he smiled americans investing overseas have a long history of making their interests known to those governments why should japanese businessmen be expected to do otherwise all of a sudden noda glanced at his watch rose abruptly and bowed well the afternoon seems to have gotten away from us i wish you to know i am extremely honored youve taken time from your undoubtedly busy schedule to visit with us senator it has been most pleasant he shook hands with jack as he continued of course i have not yet had the opportunity to review the thinking of the man expected to oppose you in next falls senate contest i believe he is representative mark reynolds is he not jacks polite smile sort of froze on his face but im sure i will noda proceeded blandly again let me stress that voices such as yours are important there are so few opinionmakers in america individuals such as dr richardson and yourself who have the receptivity to appreciate the importance of dai nippons program and its objectives i quickly offered to show the distinguished senator to the door hoping i wouldnt need that christmasgift dog muzzle he was still closing his briefcase as we passed the guards a couple of guys who looked like the heavies in an old bruce lee karate epic click we were on the elevator click we were headed down good christ he exploded before he could say anything else i waved for silence around here the walls probably had ears shortly thereafter i discovered id underestimated even that in minutes we were on third avenue autumn wind in our hair with odonnell positively awestruck by matsuo nodas balls matt did i hear what i thought i did his eyes were grim that hes got x million bucks that say you get retired if you fuck with him my reading was i play ball with him and his crowd and hell write a blank check for my campaign next year i cross him and ill be watching the mark reynolds show every night on prime time right through election day he was livid matt take my advice and get out of this thing that bastard thinks this countrys for sale if he expects me to run interference for him on the hill while he gears up for world war three hes making a big mistake jack i cant quit now who else is going to keep an eye on this guy besides hed never let me i know too much so what hes got to be stopped look if youre so worried then deliver a major speech on the senate floor about all these japanese billions rolling in absorbing companies with a lot of samurai fanning out to take names and kick ass across the boardrooms of america it ought to get picked up by the nightly news then well see what the country wants to do about it the problem obviously was what could the country do about it and more than that where would it eventually lead did anybodytam richardson includedseriously believe this was merely a temporary helping hand history had a practice of going in one directionforward so after noda had acquired a lot of our hightech outfits maybe even kept them from going the way of mostek and others what next more and more i was beginning to wonder if this was really preferable to our blundering along as best we could on our own after gazing at the sky a minute he declared he was going to do exactly what id said blow the whistle he was about to write a speech that would be read the length of america maybe even in the white houseunless as henderson claimed nobody there these days read anything but teleprompters nobody was going to buy off jack odonnell i watched as he bulldozed a matron and her furcollared pooch out of the way to grab the next cab for his midtown office on the way back through the lobby i stopped off and grabbed a copy of time had we made the weeklies yet yep lead article all about how the japanese loved investing here going up in the elevator though i happened to flip past a profile of some recently disappeared luminary in the academic world the guy who was supposed to have been the father of artificial intelligence it occurred to me the piece might be of interest to tam shed been so busy she was probably out of touch when i got back up to twelve noda was gone vanished almost as though he hadnt been there i wanted to huddle with tam about his evasive new song and dance but since i was holding the magazine i showed her the item the rest of what happened you can probably guess she had been out of touch oh my god allan friend of yours im sorry nobody told me she grabbed it and quickly skimmed the article finally she headed for her office ive got to call sarah tam i caught her arm id finally made the connection i think i already know the story then i recounted hendersons bizarre tale that was the first time though not the last that i saw tam richardson look scared she obviously knew something i didnt matthew something is very very wrong just repeating what i heard i looked at her now twisting the magazine in her hands and decided to press is there more to this than youre telling me i dont know she glanced around i really dont want to talk about it here whatever you say i paused how well did you know him he had dinner at my apartment not more than a couple of months ago she tossed down the magazine and he asked me to do something for him did you dont know why i asked it just seemed relevant no i guess you could say i did just the opposite now it all makes me wonder if if maybe it has some connection with her voice trailed off what what connection nothing she was starting to clam up she didnt say anything more and so far as i know that phone call never got made besides something else occurred that night to occupy her mind when she got home she picked up her mail and decided to crash shed been so busy she still hadnt finished with all the odds and ends that had stacked up during the tokyo trip but that night she was too knockedout to bother she poured herself a glass of white wine quickly checked the mail and was getting ready for bed when she first noticed the light flashing on her answering machine for a minute she considered just letting it wait there was nobody she wanted to talk with who wouldnt still be there in the morning but finally curiosity got the upper hand and she pushed play there was only one message in japanese ms akira mori wanted to see her friday morning at the dni offices it wasnt a request it was a summons wait one minute mori when did she get into town and more to the point where did morisan come off summoning tam richardson for a command appearance she had another glass of wine and finally went to bed wondering who exactly was now running the show at dni friday late she awoke still thinking about allan what was going on she was beginning to get worried and maybe a little frightened finally just before lunchtime she got her briefcase and hailed a cab for uptown after she cleared the checkpoint at the twelfthfloor elevators she spotted morisan right there in the midst of the action this woman wastes no time she told herself mori an incongruous peacock of designer elegance in the midst of the bustling shorthaired staff was poring over a stack of printouts assembled on a desk in the center of the floor meanwhile the office was going full tilt the green print of crt screens glowed printers hummed all around data bleeped between terminals and staffers were hurrying over selected documents for mori to review also since heavy buys were underway the latest sec filings required when one entity acquires more than five percent of the stock of a given company were being readied as it happens i was already on hand too over in nodas office where we were going over some paperwork the days news as far as i was concerned also was morisan shed appeared bright and early held a closeddoor confab with noda proceeded to do some photocopying then commandeered an office by purest coincidence i was doing some copying of my own round about then and ended up on the copy line right behind her inhaling her perfume next an odd thing happened as we all sometimes do when rushed shed snatched up her copies while the last original was still on the machine then she asked me if i wanted regular size or legal legal i said and she reached to flip the switch as she did though she accidentally clicked the print button with those long fingernails whereupon she stalked off rummaging through her copies and forgetting the original not for long two seconds later she was back to claim it but by that time an unauthorized copy was lying in the output bin i didnt even see it however when i scooped up my own pages a minute later mixed in with them was a sheet listing some names and numbers with revisions lettered across the top i started to toss it then paused to glance over the names for a moment hang on everybody this is very out of line thats when i decided to slip it into my briefcase when mori saw tam come in she quickly stacked the printouts she was reviewing into a neat pile then beckoned her toward the far corner of the floor tam noticed that moris new office was at the opposite end of the building from nodas i understand nodasan has appointed you director of this division mori was ushering tam into the office all the while running her fingers nervously through her sculptured black hair congratulations not exactly a great opener it sounded even harsher in japanese since it was so at odds with the usual polite greetings ive been hired to do a job morisan and i intend to do it so desu ne mori concurred in japanese her voice a trifle strained tam thought she looked a bit blearyeyed after her flight in from tokyo but there were no half measures about the woman she was all business in a prim silk suit shading to gray with a bright blue scarf tied at the neck she wore high heels but they didnt slow her brisk stride as she paced around her desk i am sure you will do it well i would like you to know i am prepared to assist you at every step well tam had a pretty clear idea of how she intended to proceed which didnt really include a lot of assistance from akira mori what exactly had noda been telling this woman maybe she mused morisan just hadnt been fully brought up to speed i noticed that youre reviewing our analytical sheets tam continued those are the firms were going to start restructuring first and if you do not receive the desired cooperation what will you do then mori asked evenly as though she didnt already know the answer well just keep up stock acquisition till we have whatever we need also i intend to appoint a representative to sit on the board of directors to monitor performance and make sure our program is implemented that is my understanding as well mori went on and concerning the matter of who will be assigned ive just finished putting together a list of management experts theyre dedicated people most of them will probably help us for a small honorarium instead of their usual consulting fees these personnel are an area i wish to discuss with you mori pushed ahead almost as though not listening that was when tam realized she was finally getting around to the real agenda of the meeting it is our opinion that at this stage the heavy involvement of americans in that capacity would be counterproductive our opinion tam didnt like the sound of this who exactly is our i have reviewed dai nippons program in some detail with the interested parties in tokyo mori appeared to be making an announcement they have concurred that at this stage it would be more efficient if we assigned our own specialists to assist in the management of these companies your own specialists now tam was starting to bristle just whom do you have in mind industrial experts such as kenji asano for example may be involved she continued we have a great reservoir of talent to choose from particularly within the ministry of international trade and industry miti tarn stared at her dumbfounded she couldnt believe her own ears that was like calling in a fox to fortify your henhouse youve got to be joking the decision was made last week mori fixed her coldly nodasan has been informed and he finds the suggestion acceptable well i dont tam flared its outrageous there is something you must understand dr richardson mori continued in japanese the management of a company should represent its ownership since dai nippon will be holding what amounts to a controlling interest in these firms we are obliged to assist them using whatever international specialists we feel are most qualified to contribute for now we believe that the expertise in our ministry of international trade and industry is most appropriate since it has guided corporate growth in japan for many years with undeniable success thats irrelevant tam steamed first most miti executives dont necessarily understand american business and second miti has no right involving itself in the operation of our industry its a flagrant conflict of interest there i must disagree with you on your first point many japanese firms have been manufacturing here and have an excellent record of labor relations and management success as to your second point using specialists trained by miti is simply the most efficient way to transfer japanese expertise it wont be allowed why shouldnt it be any people we bring here will be on leave of absence hence they will no longer have any official ties to the japanese government no law prevents us from appointing whomever we wish ouch tam thought shes right nothing could stop dai nippon from restructuring the boards of directors of the companies in which it held a voting majority of shares in fact several japanese firms had already taken over and reopened the manufacturing facilities of some of the very companies mitis targeting had decked only a few years before bringing in japanese board members as part of the deal whats more americans loved it governors were falling over themselves to attract japanese joint ventures to their states does nodasan understand the significance of bringing in miti personnel there are many interests to be addressed at this point i wandered in together with noda to talk about setting up a meeting that afternoon wed been reviewing dnis plans for a new program of real estate investment and construction part of expanding the research or manufacturing facilities of the firms it was now in the process of absorbing i passed a pleasantry with tam then studied her puzzled you look a little distressed this morning im receiving an update on a change in our program tam glared back at mori then turned to noda whats this about bringing in people from miti noda smiled but he looked a trifle uncomfortable think of it as a temporary measure he nodded toward mori then looked back at tam we always like to operate by consensus and that consensus among the fund managers who have joined us appears to be that our investments should initially be monitored by our own people i thought this office was going to be in charge of determining who our people would be not somebody in miti tam fixed him coldly then turned on me did you know anything about this bringing in honchos from miti news to me i examined noda i understood the management end of this was going to be directed by dr richardson he was smiling again but it will be she will continue to meet with the ceos of the firms we intend to assist to provide our preliminary analysis of their operations and she will be with us every step we take it hardly sounds that way tam was boiling the way it looks now i set up a reorganization plan then mitis people come in and take over merely for consultation dr richardson i assure you he glanced uncomfortably at morisan both tam and i had the same hunch at that point nodas backers had started to get a little edgy about his investments so theyd decided to send in some brass from the delta force to keep an eye on things but youd never have suspected that as he continued dr richardson surely you must be aware that miti personnel are not in the habit of as you phrase it taking over at most miti merely recommends policies to enhance competitiveness furthermore the individuals we will engage will no longer be associated with miti they will merely be specialists in our hire their participation will be extremely beneficial please believe me if making decisions like this is your idea of consensus then i dont think much of it tam was getting increasingly wound up and ill tell you something else i intend to review the government connections of anyone you bring in im going to have final say we all want to work together noda continued smoothly our plans are continuing to evolve of course i will insist on full americanjapanese coordination and cooperation at every stage he looked squarely at tam you have my word she glanced over at me trying her best to keep cool i was toying with my papers still posing as a neutral observer but i was equally puzzled why would japans ministry of international trade and industry let its people be used to assist american companies okay mitis elite technocrats were probably the cream of japans management talent but they already had their hands full more to the point given mitis sorry history of rule bending and economic guerrilla warfare why would it now cooperate in dai nippons plan to restructure the hightech segment of us manufacturing i asked noda pointblank mr walton if you choose to see japan and the us as competitors then i suppose you could regard this as our ancient tradition of giving salt to the enemy he smiled awkwardly bullshit thats what i thought not what i said which was nothing tam in the meantime had her own question to chew on mori had mentioned ken asano was he involved too since mori had specifically named him as being on the miti team that she or somebody now planned to enlist was this a tipoff that ken was in with them up to his neck was this the trust hed talked about since tam looked as if she was getting ready to resign on the spot i figured a little coolingoff time for everybody might be in order dr richardson if were about through here could you help me a minute i thumbed toward the open door tanaka wants you to approve the final setup for the partitions i quickly discovered i was wrong about the idea she would quit as we worked our way past the computer terminals and stacks of printouts retreating toward the center of the floor she declared war miti or mori or whoevers behind this is going to have a fight on their hands we dont need them involved hate to be the bearer of bad news but i think were being kept in the dark about a lot of whats cooking i kept my voice low scarcely above a whisper as the japanese staff milled in and out theres a sheet of paper in my briefcase that id like to go over with you yet another example of the curious new developments around this place she poured herself a cup of green tea from the large urn stationed in the middle of the floor what do you mean well talk about it later i poured some tea for myself i think somethings gone haywire that startled her and she began to tune in things are pretty haywire now this may be even worse i came across something a while ago that doesnt add up i looked at her i think we ought to talk about it now not here how about tonight cant theres a damned faculty dinner i have to attend then tomorrow night where what would you say to my place downtown i think you live right around the corner from me this has to be strictly business matt guaranteed i raised my palm well ive got a lot of work shall we make it for seven i was handing her my card address and number thereon the cocktail hour she was still glaring at moris office as she absently took it well all right she glanced back seven see you there jack odonnells speech to be delivered to the senate that tuesday sort of slipped to the back of my mind maybe it shouldnt have after getting back to his office that afternoon he dictated about three versions before he had it the way he wanted it friday morning he messengered a copy down to my office and i can tell you it was a beauty hed got it all and hed got it right later friday however he received a phone call from matsuo noda after the usual preliminaries saying how much hed enjoyed their meeting mr noda confided he was calling as a personal favor to the senator since theyd hit it off so well the previous day turns out hed just been talking to the ceos of various japanese outfits scheduled to set up manufacturing operations in some of the rustbelt mill towns in upstate new york here was the distressing development seems they were all of a sudden taking another look at sunny tennessee the problem was they were upset by the antijapanese tone a lot of new york publications were taking these daysjapan bashing in the times editorial pages things like that noda however felt all this was very shortsighted of those japanese investors and he wondered if senator odonnell would like him to put in a word for the empire state pause he hated to mention this but people were even talking of closing certain japaneseoperated factories already in place such as that big one in elmira jacks hometown and moving them south but he thought threats such as that were very impolite and he was hoping he could find time to straighten the whole thing out like i said it would have been a hell of a speech chapter sixteen that saturday turned out to be the day when winter descended abruptly and with rare vengeance remember were only talking middecember still a dozen full shopping days till you know what but it could have been the depths of january after things kicked off with what seemed a foot of snow around three the elements really started to unload everything from sleet in historic proportions to a windchill that would have frosted the horns off a bexar county billy goat while i waited for tam i battened down the garden covered the outdoor furniture and prudently provisioned the larder with a flagon of remy antifreeze ben in the meantime was lumbering around downstairs eyeing the snowcovered garden with an air of disgruntlement the universe had turned unacceptable something he never greeted with equanimity i decided to try and divert his misery by hauling him up on the long country french dining table and combing some of the knots out of his shag when that merely reinforced his overall gloom however i called it quits located a consoling rawhide stick for him to gnaw and poured a brandy it was along about then shortly after nightfall that tam finally appeared a cab with snow chains dropped her off shed come directly from the office which noda had just shut down for the weekend and i helped her navigate the sleetcovered steps i got the immediate sense that her first impression of my living quarters was unchanged from the old days in spite of all the art armor and antiques the place had a poignant rootlessness about it boys like toys they just get more expensive as the bank account grows also since shed been in the man game long enough to spot a divorcerebound case a mile off she probably had me figured from the start part of that army of emotional paraplegics in our feckless day and age after the miti twist however i suppose she was ready to consult with somebody concerning the direction things were headed i warmly invited her downstairs to the sisalcarpeted den just off the garden and dumped some logs in the fireplace next i pulled out a few discsmendelssohn seemed about right for some reasonand offered to whip up a batch of margaritas twould be i dared to hope a long winters eve alas she said no thanks a club soda and lime would do fine looked as if i would be working barehanded without aid of that universal socializer distilled spirit so i rustled up a perrier then poured another snifter of brandy for myself since she appeared exhausted my first suggestion was she kick off her shoes and get comfortable no argument after settling in shoes off and feet to the fire she announced she was ready to hear what id come up with before an awkward silence could grow i snapped open my briefcase dr richardson in keeping with the ground rule that this is a formal business meeting let me introduce my first agenda item i flashed her my best smile then pulled out the purloined page this is part of the paperwork mori seems to have brought with her i dont understand too well what its all about but my first impression is that somebody has decided to do some major tinkering with your program take a look at this and give me an opinion i passed it over she glanced down then back at me are you supposed to be bringing dni documents home that was her first reaction swear to god look this just accidentally got in with some of my photocopies all it is is a list of companies and i didnt want to talk about it there in the office i reached over and ran my finger down the string of firms then to several columns of numbers off to the right the question is what are these outfits suddenly doing on dnis buy list she studied it a second looked around the room and said exactly nothing doesnt that seem at all strange to you i finally spoke up as i understand the plan you want to shift more corporate funding into research in the companies youre buying into i do have it right dont i she nodded okay then youre with me so far but take a look at this i indicated the column of numbers thats the current research budget for these firmsit says so right up there on the top presumably these figures came out of the analytical setup down on eleven does anything about those figures seem out of line she looked at it her eyes widening then narrowing well i dont know what this sheet is all about she glanced up these companies arent part of our buys got news for you i think they just made the team i pointed to the heading see thatacquisition schedule revisions when she said nothing nada i continued but youre right they werent on the original list the reason being i would surmise that they didnt need any of this socalled management rx you guys are supposed to be cooking up look at that one and that one even i know enough to realize those outfits are operating with a real cash surplus right now have plenty of r ampd funding already and hence are doing just fine thank you the figures in fact are right over there in that column on the right matt we dont know what this is for true true so lets just play pretend and to make it fun let me show you something else i rummaged through my briefcase some more finally extracting another paper i copied a corresponding page from the file on current buys i laid it alongside the first she picked up the second sheet checked it over i helped compile this list then maybe youll see what im saying formats the same the only difference is some of the dogs have been dropped and replaced by some very well run corporations youre right about that all hightech heavy research investment progress the first scale to fall from her eyes then lets play another round of this pretend game as i understand it you and yours put together this original list of companies for one main reason lousy management but all of a sudden the outfits in the worst shape on list number one have disappeared on list number two meaning i would assume that theyre no longer part of the program at least as its laid out on this revised version mori must have brought in from tokyo what are you trying to say for chrissake what did she think i was trying to say oh nothing much i suppose except that it looks to me like somebodys just knifed your program in the back all of a sudden dnis going to start buying outfits that already have good management not to mention heavy research commitments so what exactly is anybody supposed to be doing to help them along i paused maybe a better question is who removed those others the ones now winging it on a hope and a prayer she laid down the two pages side by side and began to compare them in more detail a finger here a finger there but strictly no comment along about then ben got up and checked out the sleet covered garden then lumbered back and plopped down beside us clearly expecting a pat for diligence in the line of duty she remarked that english sheepdogs always reminded her of a big flotaki rug after that putdown she returned to the lists i hoped the poor guys sensitive ego wasnt mortally fractured well she announced finally my socalled discovery didnt add up to much matt i officially have no opinion about this it could mean anything she shrugged maybe the new twist is to start with the companies that can benefit the most from coordination take on the easy job first where the payoff will be greatest save the tough ones for later oh sure who knows it could all be very innocent right i mean for all we can tell the moon might really be green cheese i wondered what had gotten into her all of a sudden it was plain as day what was happening but instead of congratulating me on my sleuthing she was turning obtuse tell me exactly how you got this sheet like i said more or less by accident i told her the story again i was about to chuck it then i took a second to mull it over thats when i got to wondering why the numbers seemed so inconsistent next thing i noticed was the new list of players all of a sudden the heavens opened a vision i got up to freshen my brandy then came back she was still sitting there maybe too exhausted to think straight but i take it you dont believe my little epiphany means anything since i dont know what it means im not going to engage in a lot of uninformed speculation good christ i thought whats happened to all her reputed brilliance you know she went on i dont think you should be taking any more documents out of the office theres a reason for all the security hey back off i just have boundless curiosity i still couldnt fathom her lack of interest no make that hostility look i dont claim to understand how birds fly how fish swim or how this whole damned picture fits together however my new albeit uninformed observation is that noda and company are not exactly giving us the fine print on their scenario exhibit a this strange new list i think some fresh air would be nice she rose to her feet located her shoes and strolled over to look out at the garden the sleet and snow was about a foot and a half deep why dont we go into the back what i stumbled to my feet do you have any idea she looked at me a bit funny then made some hand signals huh finally i realized she was telling me she didnt want to say anything more inside the house talk about paranoid suddenly the reason for all her hemming and hawing over my little theft came clear she actually thought we might be bugged get serious lady anyway she gave me the coolit sign then calmly started putting on her coat astounded by the possible dimensions of human mistrust i dug out a sweater from behind the couch and opened the door she was still nursing that damned designer water ben snapped to alertness and galloped to the door whereupon he confronted the weather his strategic decision executed with lightning speed was to switch into his patented zone defense surveillance mode against backyard trespassers which required staying inside where it was warm i gave him a pat freshened his water bowl and followed her out into the snow there was a brief lull in the weather the sky glowed red from all the streetlights at least what you could see of it through the surrounding brownstones and the leafless ailanthus tree at the back i looked around as ben gave the fence one last survey then plopped down and settled his chin onto his paws with a grunt tam i suppose had finally concluded i wasnt pulling some kind of loyalty check for noda so that was when she opened the real can of worms how long was she making copies i mean you were standing right behind her mori i dont know less than a minute i examined her a trifle puzzled why how many pages probably half a dozen or so she just stood there a moment gazing up at the sky then she went back inside stepping around ben and returned with the sheet did you notice this she pointed to the upper righthand corner i took it and strained in the faint light from the back windows it says i looked up you think that means i think your episode suggests at least two things she took back the page the first one is this is part of a much larger document with you so far a hundred and fortyseven pages and the second you said she only made half a dozen copies then overlooked this she paused dont you think akira mori can count at that moment the snowy night grew silent as a tomb what are you suggesting i finally blurted it out that she left this on purpose maybe but i dont have the slightest idea why christ you have a very mistrusting mind i slogged on through the snow for a few steps then turned back im convinced it was accidental all right lets just say thats a possibility for now but what we do know for sure is wed better get our hands on the rest of this hey dont look at me im already in this scam deeper than i ever intended to be i say we either play their way or cut and run we start getting too nosy and we could end up on the wrong end of one of those uzis matt theres something else i noticed about the list its ominous care to elaborate i kicked at the snow well not out here im freezing she pulled her coat a bit tighter is there someplace inside where we can talk ive got an idea but lets warm up first i led the way back in the fire had died a bit so she settled on the floor next to the hearth the smooth contours of her cheeks golden in the flickering light sure you wont have a brandy after all to combat the chill the quartet opus no was enveloping us both violins emerging out of the shadows she looked up and smiled maybe it would be nice i fetched it slid onto the floor next to her and stretched to stir the coals ben sauntered over to keep me honest plunked down and was immediately out like a light howre we doing for warmth i propped the poker against the side of the mantel then reached over and touched her tangled hair lightly with my fingertips to my everlasting surprise she leaned next to me much better maybe we should both bail out right now tonight why not just go down to my place in the islands and monitor the apocalypse off the satellite dish watch miti eat america was i joking only partially down home we have a saying about folks with a certain je ne sais quoi theyd do to ride the river with in my book tam was definitely one of the riders the fire snapped and startled ben who glanced up checked out the sleetcovered garden then grimly resumed his snooze she reached over and gave him a pat the first time you know i cant believe miti is behind all this i know at least one miti person myself you know somebody in miti i was a trifle taken aback who she stared at the fire his name is kenji asano you wouldnt have heard of him i lay there for a moment listening to the quartet my memory registers running a quick sort then it came to me kenji asano was the miti guy henderson said had masterminded japans rape of the us semiconductor industry you actually know him sure do she smiled very well shit i didnt really need to hear this that sounds like a little more than a professional acquaintance i looked at her for confirmation a little okay i thought guess were getting down to the straight story here press on well i have some news you may not like this asano genius personally engineered the destruction of the us industry in ram chips probably the most devastating sneak attack on america since pearl harbor she stiffened who told you that lets just say i heard it so whats this guy doing all of a sudden saving us hightech industry hes already cost this country tens of thousands of jobs and literally billions of dollars i dont believe it i know ken sure he works for miti but his job is overseeing japans own research in supercomputers hes very proud of their progress oops i swirled my snifter whatever you say if thats really true then excuse me i take it all back she looked upprobably not believing my diplomatic reversaland watched as i casually slipped my arm around her waist i couldnt tell if she wanted it to happen or not thinking i might have some momentum going i reached back and pulled a couple of wide cushions off the couch stationed them by the fire then eased us both against them i tried to do it with naturalness finesse it wasnt happening matthew underneath all that unnecessary bluster which is just as i remember youre still a halfdecent guy which i also remember but i dont really think this is a good idea she looked at me her face highlighted in the orange glow of the embers i hope its not because you have other commitments i heard my voice harden like maybe in japan im just a little distracted tonight thats all she watched as i trailed a finger around the hard tip of a nipple beneath her shirt gently she moved my hand away dont start maybe i can at least get a rain check i retired from the field possibly she smiled then gave me a telling glance a while ago you said something about another place my soundproof chamber right i rose were always open around here for travelers on a frosty night i helped her up and for this evenings special introductory offer theres a hot tub down the hall why dont you let me fill it and you can unwind those muscles for a while japanesestyle or californiastyle or whatever do you good she looked me over a second then smiled lots of nice loud running water exactly off we went to the italianmarble bathroom there off the downstairs bedroom id installed that little indulgence for joanna back during happier times these days i used it as the worlds largest laundry hamperripping it out would have cost a fortune jos revenge i called the thing she marched in took a look about the room which had one of those big tubs trimmed in redwood and said it reminded her of a place near ise she did at least have the discretion to omit the circumstances of that occasion what happened next sort of shook my cool my being a good texas lapsedbaptist you see id never bought into the nudityiswholesome ethic of the age of aquarius passed me right by i mean wheres the fun in life without a little forbidden fruit but tam just began shucking her clothes everything kept going till shed even doffed her little beige knickers piling everything one piece at a time in a neat heap on the counter just like that while bold corporate raider matt walton stood there in terminal astonishment grasping the edge of the sink as if it were a life preserver my nonchalance was an oscarwinning performance now in the attire god gave her she calmly inquired if i had any bubble bath well ah sure i mean i suppose so probably somewhere around here if not theres probably a box of tide in the basement i groped blindly in the cabinet and my hand fell upon a pink bottle whose label read mr bubble whats this then i realized it must be some suds stashed there by amy bet she saw somebody soaking on tv and concluded thats the way grownup women behaved my god its in their genes then i turned around tell you one thing dr tamara richardson was still in great shape all of her was she pulling a tease number on me or just doing what comes naturally sad to say i fear it was the latter i guess shed somehow internalized this japanese idea that nudity is no big deal tami finally found my voiceyoure something else i know youre smart and im beginning to remember you never were all that retiring how about refreshing me on a few of the other things i seem to have forgot i think i wanted to be a boy she laughed as she sampled the water with her toe i thought they had all the fun now she was pouring in a test portion of amys mr bubble then i found out girls could do anything boys could but usually better so i stopped worrying about it she stepped in easy youre talking to an unreconstructed male chauvinist what else is new you all are at heart at least you have the decency to admit it she dumped in the remainder of the pink gunk will somebody please tell me why women all women go for that stuff an exaggeration you say ever see one turn it down hey im trying to deprogram myself but its uphill work i watched as a perfectly formed breast disappeared beneath the foam i tend to be oldfashioned i recall all too well well give me a chance i leaned back against the sink you know this striptease isnt helping repress my primal male instincts a whole heck of a lot matt for somebody whos supposed to be an expert on japan youve understood very little about us us you know im half and half she flashed me a mona lisa smile as she was wrapping her hair in a towel i found myself thinking that at least she shaves her underarms a minor concession to conventional propriety well so what im an equalopportunity seductionist that is when i get the opportunity not making much headway tonight i fear another tricky smile she was starting to drive me distracted thought youd never notice matt youre an emotional basket case ive seen plenty she looked me over sympathetically sorry but ive got enough problems of my very own youll have to manage your own salvation could be youre just deceived by my sensitive nature i leaned against the counter playing peekaboo with a tan nipple now halfconcealed in the bubbles mistaking it for brain damage uh uh she shook her head in the negative i read your gender pretty well i was beginning to get a little annoyed who needed this tell you what dr richardson for all my putative failings i do happen to possess a modest allotment of native wit and my male intuition tells me your dance card is full right now that same rightbrain perception also suggests it has something to do with this mltl honcho asano so so that upsets me for a couple of reasons only one of which will probably be of any interest to you i dont think you have an entirely open mind on the possibility miti or somebody may be about to try and nail this country to the wall because if you admitted that you would also have to admit something you apparently find distasteful to concede about your prince charming i watched her eyes grow sad stop me if i cross the line from preaching to meddlingto use a little expression from my youth matthew youve just ceased being nice she looked down what do you do if you think you trust somebody and then you find out maybe that trust is misplaced old ecclesiasticus back in bible times told us in the time of adversity consider as advice goes thats still probably sound value for the dollar like for example you might want to back off and do a little thinking on whether noda and his crowd have been using you and me for that matter like a couple of patsies when she said nothing i pressed on i walk into the office yesterday the first thing i hear about is some miti connection then tonight i hear about your miti connection and its starting to sound like the same tune like maybe these guys have been playing you like a violin but why me credibility and low profile for mitis grab by sending you out to meet the victims theyve thrown the hounds off the scent dr saveamericanindustry has come to help youre so goddam clean tam impeccable credentials youre gold to those guys i was set to give her a blast but i decided to try keeping the lid on for once maybe a better question than why they chose you is why you went for it how did they brainwash you nobody brainwashed me i still think nodas being straight he can think in global terms thats a rarity and how about this asano character you sure gave me the message to back off when i questioned his intentions maybe ive been thinking with something besides my head she sighed and leaned back but then maybe not i have no reason to believe hed mislead me look i dont know anything about the situation but i respectfully suggest you ought to reflect on that possibility i looked at her by the way i seem to remember you said there was something else about the list that struck you as odd it has to do with the kind of research being done by those new firms on the list a pattern she paused what pattern id rather not say just yet until im sure its probably just my imagination something snapped inside me about then anger tam richardson i was rapidly concluding was being used by those bastards and as best i could tell this idealistic woman couldnt let herself believe it the situation royally pissed me off even more when i also suspected this asano operator had somehow been playing fast and loose with her heartstrings i decided then and there i wasnt going to let them get away with it a strange psychology takes hold of you when you sense youve been temporarily outflanked i think its that primal human response somebody once dubbed flight or fight you realize youve got two choices you can either stand your ground or you can make a run for the sidelines so what to do about dai nippon and noda and mori and asano right then and there i made a tactical decision i decided thatlike the caveman facing the sabertoothed tigerthe best defense would be to try and make the beast back off more to the point it wasnt merely tam that was imperiled maybe hendersons suspicions were right maybe this was the handshake that turned into a karate flip the beginning of world war ii part b so i figured i owed it to myself and everybody else to at least uncover the truth no entity ive always believed is unstoppable no matter how massive theres always a soft underbelly somewhere after a while any big organization gets cocky and makes a blunder sometimes in fact you can lure them into it i concluded there was only one way to go headtohead with dai nippon you want peaches you shake the tree okay youve got your theories ive got mine but for both our sakes i think its time we moved on them what do you mean she looked up i suggest we start with a little information gathering i turned on the hot water again nice and noisy then continued what do you say we go up and take a little private look around the offices tonight what better time weather alert right nobodys there its perfect we can fasttalk the security get in and check the place over and where exactly do you propose we look she examined me skeptically im there every day how about that new office mori commandeered for herself i think we ought to poke around and see what shes got maybe try and locate the rest of that document if nothing else im not sure we ought to be doing anything quite that drastic at least not just yet i didnt claim it was approved by amy vanderbilt i just say we ought to give it a shot if we dont look into this who will maybe well find something to explain the socalled pattern you think you see matt for all i know that may be nothing more than a coincidence if noda found out wed done something like this the whole ball game would be over thats the chance we take lets just see what we can come up with okay personally im beginning to think noda and your pal asano are both worldclass con artists i poured a little more cognac for us both but whoevers right we should at least try to find out who knows what if its becoming a miti show now for some purpose neither of us can imagine all right she looked apprehensive for a second only a second and then her eyes hardened you know noda and mori claim im fujiwara on my mothers side naturally she laughed and you know something else i feel in my bones that its true i believe it im japanese matthew and im proud of that i glanced over at a set of samurai armor stationed just outside the bathroom door glistening enameled steel tell you the truth im second to nobody when it comes to admiring japans ethic and their guts but i tend to draw the line at master race talk as a matter of fact i wouldnt object too strenuously if they did manage to beat us in a fair contest hell we won round one and they were remarkably sporting about it but what i want is to make sure round two is fought on level ground no inventing new rules no rabbit punches or belowthebelt stuff thats all i ask how about showing me some of those swords you claim you collect she came out with it just like that my pleasure like nothing better besides it seemed a good time for a change of pace i straightened up and headed for the back parlor upstairs then around the corner to the sword room its door now fully repaired from the strange breakin i fished out the key and snapped open the lock funny thing but walking around fully dressed had started feeling out of place maybe it is merely a state of mind all right now where to start this was a crucial moment my first impulse was to go all the way to gold that marvelous katana dating from the early kamakura or even before said to have come from the forge of the shogun yoritomo minamotos personal swordsmith but wait a minute after that what maybe the absolute tops should be saved for a more auspicious moment that sword was to my mind an almost sacred work maybe instead we ought to start with something a little offbeat then gradually work up to the best and sharpest the obvious choice in fact was a piece i considered a real curiosity racked there on the left top slot as i lifted it off and slipped it out of its scabbard the metal glistened like a mirror reminding me how long its been since id oiled and pampered my playthings im afraid nothing here was handed down by the sun goddess i was coming back down the stairs a little unsteadily like a halfdrunk samurai but this ones kind of like the old style at least the metallurgy is unusual heavy on copper and tin in a way almost closer to bronze than steel then i proceeded to point out a few interesting featuresthe nice curve of the face line the burl grain the shinto deities on the elliptical tsuba hand guard that kind of thing taking care to keep it out of the damned bubbles i was starting to get wound up as all enthusiasts do with a captive audience when she tactfully cut me off hows the handle attached or the grip or whatever its called thats the hilt the tsuka held on with a little wooden peg stuck through a hole in the metal here let me show you i had a small brass punch on my key ring that was specially designed to push it out under the grip theres a wrapping of silk braid and then a layer of the belly skin of a stingray to protect the steel but you just remove this peg and the whole ensemble slides right off i removed the handle and laid it on the sink now you can see the untempered end of the sword the tang or nakago as its called i passed the weapon to her blunt end first thats where a swordsmith engraved his signature his title the place it was forged so you always should check on a really important piece there may be cutting tests noted there like maybe they tried out the blade on a criminal or two just to see if it worked quality control god she shuddered really licensed testers did it and certified it in gold engraving on the nakago some of the ones upstairs have it but this ones an ubu virgin i watched her turn it in the dim light careful now that edge is very sharp how can you tell if its really old lots of ways the grain the signature and then too a good one should have some rust there on the nakago black not red she held it up a second and examined it virgin huh no signature she had a funny almost embarrassed expression on her face correct but like i said this ones not then who was nihon steelworks nagoya somebody you bought it from anybody ever tell you youve got a crummy sense of humor i wasnt smiling as i reached to take it back her crack annoyed me and im afraid i showed it some things you dont kid around about thats a modern foundry that turns out crappy dont get testy im only reading right there she pointed to some very faint english engraved into the metal christ i grabbed it back and held it under the light to look no mistaking there it was plain as could be thats when i finally realized the thing was a copy a goddam replica of the original okay a remarkably good one but a fake nonetheless how did this get in my closet could somebody have broken in and suddenly it hit me the robbery whoever had lifted my records must have also pulled a switcheroo on this katana leaving this piece of nagoya junk and disguising the deed by replacing the original grip and tsuba hand guard id been too loaded to notice i wanted to crack the goddam fraud over my knee like in the movies but you dont do that with a samurai sword even a phony modern one so instead i flung it down on jos italianmarble floor and headed back upstairs to check the others what in hell had happened had they cleaned me out after all my god thousands i began yanking down swords starting with the aforementioned centerpiece of the collection scrutinizing them in the light but after about half a dozen proved to be all right i started calming down nothing else seemed to have been touched well what the heck i thought it wasnt exactly a crippling loss finally i grew a little ashamed of myself and sheepishly wandered back down collecting the ringer off the floor tam im sorry somebody broke in a while back and they must have stuck this fraud in my collection its not the one i thought it was sure she just looked at me with some sympathy matthew its all right really lots of people own replicas of art i have a few prints myself its not a crime she touched my hand dont worry it doesnt matter you i bit my tongue to squelch the unpleasant word forming on my lips stomped back upstairs and returned with a real sword then i gave my lecture all over again dwelling on every insignificant detail i was going to bore the woman till she cried uncle finally i succeeded okay you win i apologize she leaned back in the bubbles you really love this hardware dont you tam i love the samurai ideals i admire craftsmanship i revere courage the guys who made and used these blades had it all if im going to collect art why not something that inspires me she just looked at me and nodded i think she really understood then lets make a pact matt you and me she finally spoke up well face dai nippon or miti or whomever honorably and well keep them honest samurai i smiled lineage to lineage and may the best person win i returned the sword and locked up then lounged in the bedroom and chatted through the open door while she finished her soak it didnt seem proper to lug a chair into the bath and there was something too undignified about perching atop the loo why i kept wondering had somebody taken such elaborate pains to lift a single antique and plant a fake so i wouldnt miss it but why bother finally she got into a robe and came out whereupon we went downstairs and proceeded to put away more brandy sleet slamming against the windows that was when she refreshed my recollections of her early life the peripatetic halfbreed army brat i think truth be told she was currently about as adrift as i was she was too wary to admit it i was too incapable of touching my own fractured emotions so we talked around things saying everything except that maybe we needed somebody all the while the storm outside continued to rage but once again i was feeling those stirrings that id kept on ice for way too long alas though it had to end about one am we geared up she retrieved her coat i banked the fire and we straggled out into the sleet after finally managing a cab we headed uptown wed agreed on the rules now we were off to face the beast chapter seventeen as we rode i tried to get into mental fighting trim it wasnt easy walton i kept telling myself youre too old for this kind of intrigue and why drag this innocent woman in youre not shuffling paper and cutting deals and then going out for a drink with the other sides counsel after youve both finished impressing your clients by shoving each other against the wall youre about to start fooling around with guys who carry submachine guns when you wouldnt know what to do with an uzi if somebody handed you one if these boys start shooting there wont be a lot of polite inquiries concerning due process tam was leaning against my shoulder still perfumed from the bubble bath and totally relaxed she seemed to know what she was doing or maybe she didnt want to think about the risk we were taking as for me this sam spade number was definitely not part of my legal arsenal my thoughts however kept coming back to her tam richardson was the first woman id felt this comfortable with for a long long time she was a mixture of tough and soft and she was smart what id always been looking for exit donna enter tam maybe life was going to give me another inning if we both lived that long wed headed uptown on sixth avenue rutted with slush at fourteenth street we hung a right east toward third the snowplows were out together with the salt machines while abandoned cars were lodged in furrows of ice all along the curb this was definitely shaping up as the storm of the year since most of tanakas staff lived in the japanese ghetto up in hartsdale and eastchester where theres even a japanese pta these days they surely must have caught the orient express out of grand central before the trains got stopped dead by the weather certainly tonight of all nights the dni offices would be empty this had to be our shot so shape up walton and go for it while we listened to the sleet bounce off the back window our jamaican driver proceeded to compare new york city unfavorably with every armpit hed ever known as well as a few arctic locales he doubtless was acquainted with only by reputation i finally tuned him out and began asking myself one question over and over what exactly are we going to do if we figure out theres some kind of skullduggery afoot is there any way to stop them even if we wanted to probably nothing short of congresss cracking down could keep nodas money out of the country and whos going to support that kind of legislation most solons in fact were hailing dni and its japanese billions as the salvation of america no lawmaker was staring at the cameras and viewing with concern this new godsend of cash ditto the stock exchange they were nervous downtown sure but given the avowed purpose of wall streetattracting moneythere wasnt exactly a groundswell of sentiment against dai nippons massive investments noda had come into the market at its darkest moment and begun shoveling in capital how could this be anything but positive so every time another japanese billion rolled in and prices ticked up some more everybody merely leapt for joy the japanese were coming to rejuvenate our land cheered the journal billions from the cashrich japanese capital markets were voting with their feet to be part of americas resurgence maybe theyre right i told myself about the only discordant voices in this chorus of hesitant hallelujahs belonged to a few oped sourgrape academics i recalled one piece in particular from late last week who was it robert reich lester thurow adam smith this must be how it felt all those years in europe as they helplessly watched the invasion of american money has the us now joined the third world capitalized by rich yankees from the east now at last we realize that setting up plants here for coproduction was merely the foot in the door does it matter if us industry is owned by american pension funds or japanese insurance companies guess not unless you happen to care whether we still control our own destiny america soon to be the wholly owned subsidiary the writer was just blowing smoke and knew it these days a harangue in the times and a token will get you on the subway even henderson was taking a new look at noda astounded by his market savvy the georgia po boy who once summarized his own trading style as the four fs find em fleece em fuck em and forget em had met his match what a play noda had made to bill my new client had acquired the aura of some omnipotent invader from the depths of spacethe creature that ate wall street his eyes glazed over whenever he reflected on nodas masterful onetwo punch billions skimmed inside a week tam take a good long look i was pointing up into the night as we emerged onto the slippery sidewalk the house that noda built did all of this happen since only late september time flies when youre having fun she slammed the door and headed for the lobby calm as could be okay walton youd better toughen up too i rewarded our grumbling cabbie with a vulgar tip and watched the vehicle slowly roll off into the sleet tires crunching to end another of those passing new york intimacies so vivid yet so forgettable as it turned out lobby security was a breeze since yours truly had approved the application of the night guard personally right after dni took over eddie mazzola blue uniform and grasping a styrofoam cup of coffee glanced up from the sunday daily news his face generic staten island what brings you out on a night like this mr walton nothing wrong i hope do me a favor eddie burn this place down well split the insurance and both retire to miami beach who needs new york he concurred the idea had merit i then went on to mention that wed just come from uptown dr richardson here had forgotten some kind of gobbledygook up on twelve and we wouldnt be a minute tell you the truth eddie my fingers are too damned numb to bother signing the visitors book he saluted and returned his concentration to the knicks perennial slump we took the night elevator up and somewhere around the time we passed the ninth floor we managed to settle on a story noda we would say had called tam and asked her to hurry up a special report on one of the firms for monday wed just left a dinner party on the east side thought wed drop by and pick up some printouts since she wanted to work at home tomorrow shouldnt be more than a minute as the number above the door hit twelve i tried to remember how to pray in the hallway we waved at the tv eye and the steel door opened standing there was shiro yamada cropped hair trifle burly gray uniform one of the regulars he shifted his uzi as we came through then he recognized tam and bowed low by the wildest of good fortune yamada only spoke japanese a linguistic limitation that turned out to be crucial tam began by observing the niceties she commiserated with him about the weather the late hour would the next shift be able to get through and relieve him he was all bows and deference and hai hai finally she worked around to why we were there almost as though that were a nuisance and the real reason had been to drop by for a chat by the way she added there were a couple of things she needed from her office she gave him the story yamada listened bowing hai hai then sucked in his breath to demonstrate wed presented him with a serious conflict of obligationswhich for a japanese is the most disturbing prospect imaginable this situation entails great difficulty he said drawing in more air through his front teeth honto ni muzukashii desu muzukashii deshoo ka enquired tam difficulty hai so desu yes and he was deeply apologetic lots of sumimasen very sorry at first i thought he just hadnt bought the story but then it turned out that there were these rules you see no one was allowed on the floor weekends without a pass signed personally by tanakasan he glanced at his watch it was nearly two am more heavy intakes of air and muzukashiis of course the honorable dr richardsonsan being an honorable director herself should be able to come and go as she pleased but the rules he seemed to be pleading with tarn to help him find a resolution for this towering dilemma whats the problem tam i enquired sotto voce no fucking pass after an extremely awkward pause a light bulb clicked on in my simple mind with great theatrics i suddenly slapped my own forehead gave tam a tipoff in english and began rummaging my pockets when we left the house id grabbed an old topcoat not worn since that rainy night i met noda and in it somewhere was she started explaining that waltonsan may have brought the pass with him and merely let that fact slip his mind then i felt what i was looking for in the bottom of the inside pocket nodas meishi his business card complete with the english note scribbled across the back how stupid of me i apologized had it all along noda sans top priority pass he gave it to me only yesterday yamada took the business card and studied it with a puzzled look what did this have to do with anything thats when i impatiently turned it over and pointed to the english scribbling on the back nodas initials i groused right there at the bottom hai wakarimasu he understood that nodasama surely had written this but so what it wasnt the official form that the rules specified more muzukashii nodasan was in a rush i apologized again didnt have time to locate the regular form tam passed that along in better japanese soo desu yamada thoughtfully agreed that such oversights sometimes happened everybody knew the big daimyo had a tendency to override official channels he shifted his uzi uncertainly nodasama insisted i finish this report by monday tam stressed we should only be a minute yamada scrutinized the back of the card a moment longer holding it up to the light what was he going to do finally he handed it back bowed reluctantly and looked the other way it was a go god that was close tam closed the door behind us and clicked on the lights you dont know how lucky we were if morikawa had been on duty tonight forget it hed never have bought that cockandbull routine about a dozen computer workstations had been installed on twelve to link up with the mainframe and data center on eleven as we moved quickly past the sleeping screens blind eyes staring vacantly into space there was an eerie ghostlike abandonment to the place all the more so because of its hectic motion during regular hours the phantoms of regimented analysts seemed to haunt the rows of empty desks tam remarked shed never seen it like this the nerve center off duty only the storm of the decade together with two am sunday morning could create such solitude it took god to shut down dai nippon okay time to move fast lets hit moris lair i was whispering as we neared the corner office ahead was the closed door solid oak i took a deep breath and reached for the knob it was locked no dice i looked around at tam who was still wearing her lamb coat gray against her dark hair sleet melting on the shoulders let me try she gave it a twist nothing i dont suppose wed be very smart just to kick it in though thats what i feel like right now after all our trouble she turned to me maybe theres a key somewhere in nodas office think theres a chance could be i was rummaging my pockets first though let me check something i pulled out a ring and began to flip through it i ended up with a master courtesy of the rm amps floor manager that day they turned in their keys now if this internal door lock hasnt been changed yet maybei selected one and kissed it for luck here goes the key a large silver model was resistant the way masters always are undeterred i wiggled it forcefully and slowly it slipped into the knob a couple of jiggles more and the thing began to revolve under my hand we emitted matching sighs of relief as tam shoved the door wide and reached for the light switch now ive got to regress into the past a lot of their reports are in japanese she went on to explain that although she could read the kana syllabaries easily enough shed forgotten a lot of the kanji ideograms she could piece together enough to work through a simple newspaper story but heavy technical prose was always tough she quickly sorted through the papers piled in neat stacks atop moris desk but who knew what most of them said nothing looked like my stolen list next she checked the drawers of the desk one contained a heavily marked printout the others nothing time was ticking if yamada decided to make the rounds no quantity of creative fiction would save us she quickly grabbed the printout at least we had one item that might give us something what though we still werent sure nothing resembled the page id lifted but locating that document now appeared increasingly like a long shot anyhow guess everything seems easy till you actually try doing it where else to look i glanced around the room wondering about the file cabinet probably locked and besides thats when i saw it on a side table next to some technical books was an item wed both failed entirely to notice a large leather attache case tam i think weve hit pay dirt check that out do you suppose she could have forgotten it last night when they shut the place down maybe she didnt need it anythings possible i remember seeing her carrying it around yesterday afternoon well could be this is our find i lifted it and realized it was empty shit i slammed it down and just then detected a faint rattle inside hold on a minute i carefully shook it again and listened tam theres something in here i vote we take a peek which is what we did no harm right i mean the darned thing was just lying there no break and entry guess what was inside not paper not a miti report not lunch nothing in fact except for a shiny little compact disk a cd what the hell is this doing in here did she bring along some beach boys matt thats an optical disk a cdrom she suddenly seemed very pleased huh compact disk readonly memory except this one looks to be erasable and writable this is the latest thing in computer storage technology she held it up to the light which reflected a rainbow of colors off its iridescent surface maybe weve found what we came for lets take it and go is this like the cds in record stores the ones you play back using some kind of laser gizmo same technology only this is for text and data not music these can hold fivehundred megabytes about one hundred and fifty thousand pages then i have some disquieting information to impart i saw somebody come in here one day after shopping at tower records and a cd hed bought tripped the metal detector out there in yamadas anteroom like he was wearing sleigh bells down inside this shiny plastic must be aluminum or something we cant take it out i turned it in my hand and besides what would we do with it anyway stick it in a walkman and listen to all the little digits spin by in hifi ive got a reader at home but wait theres a better way she lifted it from my grasp and headed out onto the floor ever hear of computer crime in passing good then what youre about to witness wont shock you i watched as she kicked on one of the nec desk stations and loaded in a program next she walked over flipped a switch on a little box and a drawer glided out in went moris shiny disk another button was pushed the drawer receded and the disk was spinning silently well i thought you want peaches you shake the tree right maybe shes about to kick hell out of the orchard im going to dump this into the memory of the mother ship downstairs she did some fiddling then typed in her password to sign on the mainframe on eleven beam us down scottie in moments she and all those silicon cells below us were beeping away at each other she didnt look up just kept typing away the hollow clickclack thats become the signature sound of our computer age finally she leaned back and breathed okay its reading the disk after its in memory down there we can pull up the contents here on the screen and see what weve got i dont know how long it took to read the thing probably no more than a minute or so though it seemed forever finally something flashed on the screen and told us the disk had been dumped tam took it out of its little player and passed it to me here put this back in her case while i start pulling up the file id just finished snapping it shut when i heard an expletive from out on the floor that would not be judged suitable for family audiences watch your language she was sitting there staring at the screen finally she turned and looked at me so close yet so far its encrypted its what come and look i did on the screen was a mass of numeric garbage what was this all about matt when this disk was written whatever went on it was scrambled using some key probably the des system the dataencryption standard it keeps unauthorized intruders like us from snooping how does anybody read it a decrypting key must be in the hardware down on eleven but we cant get through to that level of the machine without an access code which we dont have very smart the electronic keys to the kingdom i watched wondering all the while what yamada was doing out there should i blunder out and chat him up with my berlitz japanese just to keep him occupied the clock above the door was ticking away tam why not just try activating the key using your own password as the access code maybe itll get you into that level on the mainframe she gave it a go without much enthusiasm predictably the message came back access code not recognized well try some others i was grasping hit it with noda or mori she did but after both were rejected the workstation suddenly signed off click out of the system whats happened now more bad news i forgot the mainframe is programmed so that you get three tries at a protected code and then it breaks the connection thats to keep crackers like us from sitting here all day and running passwords at random another security precaution three chances to guess the secret word and then youre out sounds like a game show i just stood there and scratched my head seemed we were to be blunt shit out of luck what now professor i assume there are about a hundred million alphanumeric combinations they could use close she was clicking away at the keyboard so lets think a minute she glanced back at me why dont we assume for a minute that this is a miti disk safe bet so the decryptor key in the machine here would be from miti right since mori obviously brought the disk to be read sounds good you know i was in kens office once and i recall watching some of his staff playing around with the information on one of these disks dont know why i still remember this but the password they used was i think mx something three letters followed by six digits the digits were always changing but the prefix was the same so if your wild guess about this being a miti disk is right and the first two letters of the threeletter alpha part are still mx that means there are exactly whattwentysix letters in the alphabet times a million numberstwentysix million combinations were looking for one number in twentysix million so if it takes say five seconds to type one in and try it were talking roughly a hundred and thirty million seconds to go the course i glanced again at the door besides which we get kicked off after every third try working around the clock we ought to have it sometime about what she glanced back at the screen then suddenly whirled around a funny look on her face what do you have in your office what do you mean dont you have a pc downtown just a little ibm at k and also a mac a toy i use to draw cutseypoo pictures now and then and do covers for reports how about a telephone modem built in how else could i handle all that trading and its up the ibm never turn it off little twitch left over from playing the hong kong exchanges habits die hard okay im going to try and use it to crack the code in dnis mainframe honestly for a second there i thought my hearing had gone my little ibm against that monster how forchrissake therere twentysix million well have to do something not very nice since the japanese arent used to hackers those bearded malcontents in firms who screw up business computers for spite these workstations arent buffered off sensitive parts of the system we are now going to exploit that trust in japanese culture were going to organize these terminals hook them to your computer and then direct that network against the mainframe downstairs something no japanese would ever dream of doing she got up and went down the row clicking on machines theres a list of names in my office there by the phone can you bring it coming up i fetched it it was a temporary phone book of the staff on the floor she took the list and went back down the line of stations typing something on each keyboard what are you doing tam this is crazy itll just take a second everybody here has a password to sign on to the mainframe but its just the name of the person she came back to the first workstation now the mainframe thinks ten people just signed on to the system well use these terminals to try access codes on the main computer your pc will control them so that each terminal hits it with two codes and then the next one goes on line that way well never get kicked off it should get around the three times and youre out filter downstairs she began frantically typing again what are you doing now we could try alphanumerics sequentially or randomly i think randomly is probably better itll be faster so im writing a little program for the mainframe a randomnumber generator itll start making up random access codes of mx followed by a letter and six digits and sending them to your pc downtown which will immediately feed them back in pairs to these terminals out one door in another maybe that will fool it christ woman youve got a criminal mind is this the kind of stuff you teach at nyu whats your number downtown she was typing away again i wrote it down and handed it to her i dont have the foggiest idea how youre going to be able to swing this thats all right i do just let me get your ibm networked into these terminals here fortunately its compatible and all its going to be doing for now is bouncing back numbers generated by the mainframe she flipped some switches then typed my number onto the screen i momentarily wondered if the sleet had knocked out the phone system it hadnt again the seconds crawled by but as soon as shed finished her chat with my ibm downtown the row of terminals suddenly started beeping away two shots beep the next one came alive two shots beep right down the row okay your computer is running the show now sooner or later maybe something will click she punched a couple more keys then got up its done ready to rock and roll she was putting on her coat well be running millions of numbers isnt anybody going to know youve pulled this i was i confess totally dumbfounded not unless they discover my little program in the mainframe downstairs but its just a randomnumber generator something any sophomore could write the trick is were hitting it with so many terminals it wont be programmed to keep track of all these little elves trying to sneak in and when were through well turn them all off using your modem downtown good god whatever happened to pen and pencil i was still dazed shed done it all so fast if you can find the decryptor key and get into the files then what you going to dump all the info on moris sexy little cd down at my place i hope youve got lots of paper who knows whats on it she was shutting off the lights come on lets get out of here aye aye professor i walked back clicked off the light in moris office then paused to doublecheck the lock we came for printouts remember we only have moris i was joining her she glanced at the stack on her desk then grabbed a pile and handed them to me youd better carry these and dont be put off by my ugly american routine at the door itll be for a purpose after shed doused the rest of the overheads we passed through the first security door and greeted yamada while i fiddled with tams printouts she proceeded to give him a very japanesestyle dressing down disguised as a series of pale compliments she reviewed all her work for dai nippon just happening to mention nodasama this and nodasama that every other breath the hapless guy sucked in his breath and bowed a lot and hai soed about once a second and then sumimasened some more by the time the elevator appeared shed destroyed him hed lost so much face hed never dare mention our visit to noda or anybody about two minutes later we were out on the sleetcovered sidewalk looking for a cab it was a heroic effort but eventually we were headed back downtown secure and holding although my upstairs office was freezing i was mesmerized watching the flashing green numbers spin on my little ibm screen it was like playing one of those fruit machines at the local bars except we were sitting there witnessing a gigantic intelligence turned against itself searching for the crack in its own armor there was something ironic about the fact that the japanese were such a homogenous disciplined people they didnt need vast arrays of americanstyle safeguards to keep crazies off their computers unfortunately for them they werent expecting a couple of american criminals with no such scruples by four am we had watched three million random numbers tried by first light we were up to six tam im beginning to get this sinking feeling miti must have changed the prefix i was bringing a new pot of coffee half staggering up the carpeted stairs or maybe we should have done it sequentially maybe but that would mean wasting a lot of time on numbers that are improbable this is our best chance she poured another cup of java while i just stretched out on the floor damn i wish i could remember what the other alpha was mx what that could save us days we dont have days i closed my eyes try hypnosis she sat staring at the screen for a few moments then slowly wheeled around i know why i couldnt remember it it was a repeat matt it was x go with it hang on she did some quick typing and hit the play button her face was showing the strain but i loved her looks what a champ we were together us against the beast unfortunately though the beast was still ahead at seventhirty ben roused himself and lumbered expectantly up the stairs with a silent curse i put on my boots and took him out for a stroll on the ice he hated it when we came back i decided to give up and crash come on this was insane a billiontoone shot and we didnt even know what the prize was at the bottom of the box we were getting nowhere miti had changed the code and screwed us fortunately however i heroically vowed to try and stay awake till eight am that was it the end at exactly the numbers abruptly stopped access code mxx confirmeddecryptor key activated confidential miti memos started scrolling in orderly green clumps up the screen my god matt turn on your printer chapter eighteen jack doing anything today walton what in hell jack odonnell and joyce hanson had been working through the tenpound christmas catalog known as the sunday timesshe was up to arts amp leisure and hed advanced as far as businesswhen my call interrupted their mutually agreedupon vow of silence now that her apartment in the west seventies had become jacks weekend hideaway his escape from phones and conferences the number was as carefully guarded as a minuteman launch code the time was shortly after noon hed just braved a foot of snow and sleet to retrieve the paper and a couple of fresh croissants while joyce was still recovering from a two am session editing a speech one of his staffers had drafted for some ilgwu holiday blowout the following week since he was still chewing over nodas ominous phone call wondering what to do the last person on earth he wanted to hear from right now was dai nippons lawyer even if it was me feel like coming down for a bloody mary an academic lady we both know is here and weve happened across something you might find interesting very interesting care to elaborate its a little complicated jack how about coming down he glanced out the frosted kitchen windows puzzling what in blazes was up then finally agreed keep the coffee hot youve got it joyce claimed to be unamused though in truth maybe she wasnt all that heartbroken to have the place to herself for the afternoon he grabbed his coat and said dont throw out the week in review the streets were now at a standstill so the prospect of finding let alone traveling in a taxi was implausible in the extreme as a result senator jack odonnell shared the broadway local with several hundred of his lesserheeled constituents and finally managed to get down to sheridan square from which it was only a few mushy blocks over to my place ben greeted him at the door with me not far behind doubtless looking as if id just stumbled in from a threeday forced march without a word he passed over his coat then followed me downstairs where tam was still going through the line of printouts spread across the dining room table translating onto one of my yellow legal pads i pointed him in the direction of the coffee urn stationed in the kitchen he poured a cup then came around and plopped down on the couch waltonhe sampled his brew then set it downyoure not going to believe what your goddam client did friday swear to god your man actually threatened me the bastard a nottoosubtle warning to back off jack thats small potatoes i straddled one of the dining room chairs what would you say to a possible play by our friend matsuo noda that makes pearl harbor look like a gesture of japaneseamerican solidarity two days ago i might have thought youd been smoking a controlled substance now im not so sure well were still piecing it together i dont think anybody could even imagine whats really afoot one things for sure thoughthis is big i paused it might even be that noda is somehow fronting for miti though im still not totally convinced id been turning that possibility over but i somehow couldnt buy it all the way wasnt matsuo nodas style he was a loner miti he looked at me thats government right the ministry of international trade and industry japans war department for trade yeah go on listen all nodas talk about helping american industry of course its bullshit but i think its just half the bullshit what we suspect is hes buying a little of everything so nobody will figure out their real agenda youd better back up and take this from the beginning wait a minute tam got up and started the turntable mendelssohn was still on the platter maybe we were taking too many precautions but she still nursed the idea we might be bugged with the music cranked up to we proceeded to give jack a quick summary of how the stack of memos on the table had come into our hands in a way though they raised as many questions as they answered jack nothing here is spelled out in detail we have to take everything and sort of rotate it by ninety degrees to see how noda fits in i walked over to the table tam wheres your translation of that one by whatshisname ikeda right here she handed it to me here jack start with this just to get up to speed on the background he fumbled in his pocket retrieved his bifocals and began to read the yellow sheet operation marketshare internal memo no from hiromu ikeda deputy minister of industrial technology sector ministry of international trade and industry miti subject superchips world dominance in semiconductors will provide the basis for japans control of the global information industry by the turn of the century which will be the key to our economic leadership and military strength the critical path to achieving this lies with the coming generations of semiconductor technologythe submicron gigascale superchip accordingly the objectives of operation market share in the semiconductor sector should receive the highest possible priority areas of research should include semiconductorgrade polysilicon silicon wafer production ceramic packaging quartz photomasks xray lithography supercooled josephson junction circuits and optoelectronic chips for optical switching r ampd should also be focused on digital signal processing applicationspecific integrated circuits asics specialized dynamic random access memories drams very largescale integrations vlsis for supercomputers walton i cant make heads or tails of this gobbledygook he tossed down the sheet whats this all about what it meanstam spoke upis that ikeda has targeted every emerging area of semiconductor research everything a clean sweep if he succeeds sooner or later nobody else will even be able to make the really advanced chips a few more years and america joins the third world jack looked a little skeptical truthfully i found her extrapolation somewhat fanciful myself but then who knew tam how about showing jack that other memo you know the one she didnt say anything just turned back and sorted through the stack of yellow pages till she had it out came jacks glasses again operation marketshare internal memo no from kenji asano deputy minister for research and planning ministry of international trade and industry miti subject current status of r ampd this office has now completed its review of the recent survey of research and development r ampd by japanese firms compiled by the science and technology agency the results of which are the subject of this memorandum of the companies surveyed maintain that their research is equal or superior to that of leading firms in the us and europe although only consider themselves in unchallenged top position furthermore the remaining believe their research is inferior or lagging behind the west ref to table of those who reported inadequate r ampd in high technology areas the following reasons were given whoever wrote this is just poormouthing he flipped on through the sheets then looked up saying he needs more money for basic research i hear this kind of stuff all the time hell japan already spends nearly twice what we do per capita on nonmilitary r ampd what does he want keep reading jack and youll see that the main r ampd hes pushing is in computers and semiconductors it ties in exactly with ikedas targets this is backup consensus for the big drive you still havent told me anything i didnt already suspect he tossed the pages onto a side table so how about answering a few lessobvious questions shoot first off whats this operation marketshare all about he took off his glasses and pocketed them jack remember the famous hitachi directive that got loose a while back the one on how to market their k memory chips ordering their salesmen just to keep underpricing american manufacturers till they had the sale loss no object according to henderson by the time the international trade commission got around to convicting them of dumping theyd demolished americas domestic industry and nailed down ninety percent of the market ninety you say well thats getting to be a familiar number he slumped back against the sofa out of curiosity whats included in this miti marketshare operation computers of course but also pretty much everything in high tech where the us still has a leading positionfrom biotech to aerospace these guys dont think small i gave ben a pat then pulled moris printout around going on to explain that wed come across it in the drawer of her desk it was i added obviously some kind of special computer sorting of the firms dni was targeting the categories in the sort were a breakdown of hightech areas with individual firms listed underneath together with a summary of their research expenditures take a look first notice that this printout has been sorted and converted into this list here i placed it alongside the page id found in the xerox machine voila theyre identical so okay now compare that list with the r ampd areas targeted in ikedas memo i laid tarns translation down next to moris pages see everything on ikedas miti wish list for research in semiconductors is now being done by the american outfits named here in moris sorting which is the latest revision in dnis acquisition program what are you getting at he looked it over its a pattern tam spoke up these new buyups cover japans last remaining shortfalls in r ampd i spotted it right away but what i didnt realize till we got these memos was that the areas covered by moris companies exactly dovetail with mitis goals i probably wouldnt have noticed it without her sorting mixed in with all the other companies nodas buying hes targeted those that fill the gaps in mltis semiconductor push jack looked at us quizzically are you telling me mitis behind nodas program thats where tam and i parted company she argued it was obviously a miti play why start from scratch when you can just buy what you need sound business investment for some reason though i wasnt so sure somehow that explanation seemed too simplistic unfortunately however theres a law in science or somewhere that says you should always pick the leastcomplicated theory that fits all your data hers appeared on the face of it to address the facts perfectly except for one unknown if mori did accidentally feed me the sorting that blew the whistle on nodas design why i think this has to be what the buying program on this list is all about tam answered hes taking over firms whose r ampd coincides with mitis targets matsuo noda has been put to work simply acquiring what they need but to make sure nobody suspects the real agenda hes worked up this elaborate management assistance story buying all kinds of companies her voice was bitter the next step will be to set up joint ventures between these firms hes bought and their counterparts in japan then all american r ampd would be shared which meansjacks face began to reddenthat since we always seem to lose out when it comes to commercializing what we invent the us ends up becoming one big think tank for japan in the twentyfirst century we do the research and they manufacture and market they pick our brains and then cash in on it he turned back to tam do you really think it was noda who planned all this i wish i knew what to think her voice grew hesitant as she continued to stare down at the memo its hard to believe ken would do something so unethicalespecially a grab like thiswhen im sure hes convinced japan ought to be advancing its own r ampd ken whos did you see who authored that second memo she pointed to the name kenji asano is apparently a close friend of dr richardsons i broke in my tone unnecessarily sharp unfortunately he seems to be an even closer friend of his cronies at miti tam didnt respond just sat there looking betrayed matt lets be constructive here jack walked over and shook the coffee pot then sloshed the last dregs into his cup we damn well ought to take some kind of action thats why we wanted to talk to you tam came back to life do you think you could leak something about this maybe to the times and say what he laughed a little sadly that ive happened across a set of secret miti memos that bear a coincidental similarity to some stolen dni printout dont think thats exactly fit to print he frowned but im glad our mr noda has finally let slip his true intentions i never believed all that pious malarkey about propping up american industry he snorted the man gets a few suckers like you to help him destabilize our bond markets in the process of which he turns the hightech sector of american industry into a bargain basement for miti tam sipped her coffee maybe trying to act as if jacks comment hadnt stung her the way i suspected it did i decided to try and handle her defense jack hold on a second youve got to admit that a lot of these outfits dai nippon is buying are currently on pretty thin ice if somebody doesnt come in here and help run them right theyre probably headed offshore anyway were not talking about first aid now walton were talking about matsuo noda taking over the most strategic segment of our economy after pulling the biggest scam in the history of world finance that looks to be the story i watched his cheeks redden with frustration so what do you propose we do theres no law against foreign investment securities exist to be bought well dammit matt weve both seen enough by now to realize this noda genius is up to no good weve got to stop him couldnt agree more so why dont you just arrange to have the sec shut down trading in every stock dni has in its gunsights you know thats out of the question exactly so what legal remedies are there how do you squelch a takeover program thats not even against the law thats your specialty counselor or so i hear jack be realistic we can expose this thing maybe even try and lean on tokyo to back off but aside from shutting down trading theres no legal way to actually stop matsuo noda from buying whatever he likes you cant shut japanese investors out of wall street thered be a riot downtown were talking about the open market here not some inside deal forget legalities he scowled tell me how your damned corporate raiders go about shenanigans that dont quite match the letter of the law jack ive officially quit the business retired guess you hadnt heard thats what you think you just got unretired as of this moment now give me one of those highpriced consultations youre so famous for for you jack i looked him over one last play trouble is theres not much thats doable at least on short notice you say not much which means theres something well one possibility might be to try and slow him down some make him think twice say by punching up the prices of the stocks hes aiming at make them less of a bargain thats a start not much of one well how could it be done since youre such a boy scout jack you probably wont like what i have in mind this ones not exactly in the rule book try me okay its a long shot and well definitely need some help if were going to tinker with the market then we have to have somebody wall street trusts and also somebody whos got a lot of money to play with short term sounds like our mutual friend from georgia well henderson can play the street like a symphony what im thinking of involves tricking the smartest guys around the risk arbs wed need to suck them in if anybody can do it hes the man then i say lets give him a buzz fine why dont i get him on the squawk box so we can all listen in there beside the couch was an old conference phone some client once gave me as a hanukkah gift at long last it might be good for something the risk arbs by the way are the risk arbitrageurs those speculators who live with one ear to the ground the minute they hear word inside or otherwise that a company is in play meaning its a candidate for a possible takeover or merger they immediately grab up and stockpile huge blocks of its publicly traded shares then they sit back and pray for a bidding war since company a has offered so much a share for company z maybe company b will step in and offer more or maybe company z itself will outbid them both and offer even more in a stock buyback theyre the hyenas of the hunt getting plenty of leftovers no matter who ends up buying z besides they dont really care anyway theyre not investing in american industry theyre laying side bets tam and jack settled back while i punched in bills number the doctor was in and after a few profane formalities tempered when we informed him of a female presencehe listened with uncharacteristic attentiveness i gave him an update concluding with the view that we ought to try heading off mitis presumed play henderson despite his admiration for nodas style didnt take kindly to the possible buyup of americas remaining r ampd in semiconductors a specter that coincided all too closely to his own fable about how miti had already eaten one segment memory chips i decided to start by seeing if he and i were on the same wavelength concerning countermeasures without tipping him to my own idea i asked what he thought could be done tell you it wont be easy one thing though we could maybe try and scare em off with a little brushfire try that in english bill jack interrupted dont know maybe a few hot rumors could hit the street mergers takeovers your usual quickbuck action say a few of the ceos of these outfits on nodas christmas list had a little powwow a secret meeting everybody manages to hear about and supposedly talked about gettin themselves bought out naturally theyd deny everything on the evening news which in itself will tell the street were talkin wedding bells is that really going to do us any good tam was talking to the box afternoon maam liked that last book of yours a whole lot hope youre keeping them boys sober i could almost see henderson turn up the charm sculpting a voluptuous horny divorcee in his ardent imagination tam to my surprise was not totally immune to his georgia sweet talk she sort of smiled to herself as he continued but to answer your question a takeover rumor can do marvels for your stock price what happens is the arbs come in snapping up blocks of stock and holding them just in case it can take a lot of securities out of circulation at least short term so if we could get the arbs to chasing those companies on nodas list theyd give the japs a little competition at the very least itd kite the market hurt their pocketbook bill thats why we wanted to call you how about putting your finances where your flagwaving is be an arb yourself for a few weeks lead the herd start picking up some blocks of stock and shooting off your mouth a lot about your inside information ill even kick in my modest retirement fund to help the action what if somebody pulls the rug out from under us shoots the whole thing down wed be left holding all that stock wed bid up we could lose our shirt then protect the downside by buying puts i have full faith youll think of something come on henderson be a market maker youve got the credibility all you have to do is set a spark to this then well quietly head for the sidelines to make way for all those investmenthouse yuppies who love to shoot craps with their clients money have to be a quick in and out for damned sure this hotair balloon wont stay up for long he paused clearly not wild about the idea tell you what though maybe if we had a real good story ideas well how about this maybe weve just heard on the grapevine that those outfits on nodas play list have started a little white knight talking and since this is just speculation we might as well think big know who i mean the pride of armonk give that man a gold star we both know ibm headquarters aint talked to nobody but god since watson outgrew his short pants so itd be weeks before theyd stomp on some horsepucky rumor about how they were looking into saving whatevers left of the chip business here just covering their ass well say friendly mergers no poison pill stuff thats exactly the kind of specious supporting detail that always triggers the streets greed i concurred offhand id say that sounds just about perfect for tomorrows hot tip on the exchange floor in truth it did seem like a workable first draft of an idea no law against deep background sources that turn out to be carat bullshit down the road the antitrust implications would be front page for a couple of days but since the administration adhered to the see no evil school of regulation that angle wouldnt impress the smart money america starts thinking big chucks the myth of garage entrepreneurs and staves off japan using a dose of mitis own medicine ibm rides in to rescue whats left of silicon valley it might just make matsuo noda back away hed learn america could play hardball too we told bill to take the rest of the day off jack was i can report noticeably encouraged tam also for my own part i just crashed with a few wistful reflections on my rocky nonseduction but if we pulled off our little scam she might be more inclined to take me seriously as shakespeare said lord what fools these mortals be i realized the true extent of matsuo nodas reach on monday just after noon i was still home when tam called from the office uptown to inform me of the latest developments i was so busy on the phone just then planting merger rumors with a few friendly columnists that i was almost annoyed to take time out for her call however she quickly captured my attention first the revisions on dnis acquisition program were in full swing noda had started purchasing those healthy semiconductor outfits on the new list then she went on to say that an additional set of buy orders had just gone out over the wire noda had been on his satellite hookup to tokyo all morning and hed now finalized official authorization for a minor expansion so to speak in dnis program apparently tokyo had agreed with him that his portfolio should include a certain highgrade issue to achieve better overall balance she didnt say much more for obvious reasons but we both had a strong hunch what must have happened if anything was bugged for chrissake it wasnt my apartment thats bmovie stuff it had to be my phone matsuo noda had just kicked off a new buy program to the tune of three and a half billion for what more hightech stragglers not precisely one company and in an amount intended to stay safely just below the securities and exchange commissions form d mandatory reporting twentyfive million shares of ibm roughly a full four percent of big blue it was a massive variation of the pacman takeover defense you eat anybody you think wants to eat you nodas message to us was loud and clear he could buy the usa anytime he wanted dai nippon was unstoppable chapter nineteen i hung up the phone very slowly weve moved the shadow i spoke the words to myself hesitantly maybe even a little apprehensively that was the name for a famous strategy of the seventeenthcentury swordsman miyamoto mushashi using a feint to lure your opponent into prematurely disclosing his battle plan the way i saw it matsuo noda now stood revealed it had all been a setup the financial scam the helpamericanindustry cover the miti guidance this was a takeover all the way a global takeover what else could it be and the only people on this side of the pacific who knew were matt walton and tam richardson for some reason that thought brought to mind the professor at stanford the ai guy whod disappeared what was it tam had said hed had dinner at her apartment asked her to do something for him in japan and her miti friend whose name was all over that stack of memos on the table downstairs asano where did he fit in one thing hed helped noda recruit her theyd worked together and their play had been flawless but now our friend matsuo noda had a small headache tam richardson and matt walton had exposed the underside of his game the shadow had moved which meant it would only be a matter of time before he struck where was our weakness hers and mine what would cause us to lose our rhythm to blunder hed already outmaneuvered jack odonnell with ease he had a master swordsmans unerring instinct for his opponents weakness so where was mine i had to know it before he found it hed realized jack could be blackmailed if the stakes were his constituents jobs and lives but i didnt need a job and the only life of course it was obvious amy could it be i was dealing with a madman who made people disappear if i was about to take on a pro like noda i had to cover every possibility which meant i had to get her out away beyond his reach today still though there were so many questions who was really behind all the moves the master puppeteer was it only matsuo noda or was this possibly just possibly something that wound its way even higher if so who was the point man on that akira mori the only rational countermove now was to back off and survey prevailing conditions miyamoto mushashis keiki o shiru to iu koto but to do that we had to remove ourselves beyond the reach of dai nippons sword how long did we have i glanced at the clock on my desk the little sony digital the number stared back the two dots in the middle flashing every second amy was still at school and for the moment i couldnt think of a safer place they wouldnt even let me in without a pass she didnt get out till four pm so now what simple in swordsmanship vigilance is everything and there are two things you always have to keep in view the first is called ken the surface actions the moves your opponent wants you to see the second and more important is kan the essence of things the real truth ken covers the superficial moves kan gives you the big picture instinctively i still believed we had only been witness to ken the distractions the insignificant feints of our opponent the deeper wisdom of kan still lay beyond us time to probe we had three and a half hours i got up and headed downstairs to retrieve a couple of very important memos if we needed them wed have them the rest of the pile i brought back upstairs and locked in the sword room the closest thing i had to a safe finally i reflected a second and paused to scribble emma a note asking her to feed and walk ben in case i wasnt around for a while that taken care of i retrieved my heavy topcoat from the front closet walked out into the street and grabbed a cab for the offices of dai nippon international maybe our opening move should be uromekasu to iu koto to feint a thrust that would induce a state of confusion in nodas mind then we could stage a tactical retreat to plan the final allout attack retreat to where well that part at least was easy the obvious hideaway was my place down in the islands the thing to do was to quietly catch american and head for the caribbean if noda did manage to track us down hed be in for a surprise let me explain back when the world was young and amy was still a gleam in our eye joanna and i acquired a rambling white fortress complete with pool that was being offered to the first tourist appearing on st croix that day with ready cash seemed its cosa nostra owner back in sicily so the story went suddenly needed a transfusion of a hundred grand in bail money fortunately id had a good year and happened to have the necessary liquidity it was luxurious beyond vulgarity hardwood parquet floors heavy tile roof to withstand an interpol bombing run who knows manicured grounds satellite dish a bar worthy of caesars palace three bedrooms and music in every room it was oversize and garish and pretentious and who cares i loved the place sort of a roman villa in the middle of paradise however because of the peculiar requirements of its former tenant it also had a security setup to shame fort knox including a sixfoot fence twoinchthick doors and tv monitors all over the grounds if we could locate a little hardware to match nodas uzis hed be in for a surprise should he try and send down a dai nippon hit squad for an unscheduled visit but first things first right now we needed to somehow lure matsuo noda into revealing more of his overall strategy after the cab dropped me off i rode the elevator up to twelve and passed through security the complement of guards i noticed in passing had just been expanded instead of two now there were four and when i walked out onto the floor nobody said anything but there was an almost palpable air of tension stony silence analysts nervous bad vibes very bad vibes i just ignored the stares and headed straight for tarns office she was waiting and she had an identical reading of the situation the minute i walked in she got up and shut the door her first words he just brought in more security that and the ibm thing matt hes getting worried bet your ass he is were moving in too close but i think noda figures hes just toying with us now having some fun before he cuts us in half im not afraid of him no matter what he tries she glanced at the door did you bring the memos here in my briefcase but i think its too soon to show him everything we have right now he doesnt know what weve got thats better well ive just begun to fight im going to tokyo to get the truth out of ken she paused and her voice trembled slightly with anger hes got some heavy explaining to do youre incredible i just looked at her i almost believe you still cant accept that your friend asano is in on nodas play since hes such a terrific guy matt i dont believe it he wouldnt be part of this you dont know him that i dont all im saying is this doesnt feel right he wouldnt involve miti in whatever nodas planning she sat down running her hands through her tousled dark hair you know the fact is we still dont know for sure whos really behind what exactly how does everybody fit in including us weve got pieces of a puzzle lying arounda section here a section therebut something fundamental is missing so what do we do next how about a little joust with our friend downstairs try and feel him out maybe we can lure him into making another move something thatll give away more of his game you dont think hes actually going to talk not really hell feint parry but if we watch carefully maybe well glimpse more of the outline of his strategy then well know what our counter scenario has to be i decided to hold off on telling her the getaway plan assuming the walls had ears wed already said too much look make you a deal first lets see what happens with noda then we decide what to do about your friend asano all right but lets stay cool she was locking her desk you read my mind with that settled we strolled out past the doubled security and headed down to eleven the way people looked at us i felt as naked as tam had been in the bath saturday night how much did they know matsuo noda was in his office his secretary buzzed us right through almost as though hed been waiting for our appearance dr richardson mr walton he rose to greet us how timely there is an urgent matter we have to discuss we want to talk about miti i decided to try and break his rhythm as quickly as possible take the action to him then this is a coincidence an easy smile as he resumed his seat that happens to be the very matter i wanted to explore what we want to know tam interrupted here and now is whether our program is being run by the ministry dr richardson you and mr walton are in the employ of dai nippon international not miti he leaned back in his chair though of course nothing in this world is entirely simple certain interests of the ministry are germane to our programs here then wed like to hear about it she glanced at the leather chairs but decided to remain on her feet i did the same his face was like granite well you are aware weve occasionally received input from mitis industrial technology arm how about research and planning kens section only a few informal nothing to do with marketshare he betrayed a hint of confusion quickly masked dr richardson with all due respect i fear you may not be entirely aware of the various forces at play here he leaned back this program of ours must succeed there are many avenues of responsibility but all difficulties will be overcome what do you mean all in time please believe me he smiled once more ill readily grant you our acquisition program may have evolved slightly as of late in the direction of moresolid securities but you can be assured that is merely a response to the concerns of certain conservative institutional investors in tokyo he continued a silver tongue to match his silver hair risk is involved not to mention an enormous quantity of funds there is pressure on us just now to try and maintain a prudent balance in our portfolio he glanced at his watch impatiently as if he was anxious to move ahead which brings us to the matter we have to address just to set the record straighti decided to do a little parrying of my ownyou have nothing to say about any kind of miti involvement including marketshare well this marketshare proposition you refer to probably should be thought of as merely one of the ministrys more ambitious trial balloons nothing more it has the quality ofhow do you say itwoolgathering whatever its purpose it should in no way be confused with dai nippons objectives such was nodas reply then in a remarkably convincing tone he added how could the ministrys planning possibly have anything to do with our program here tam wasnt buying looks to me like it has a lot to do with it dr richardson since i am no longer directly affiliated with miti i am not in a position to speak for every proposition arising there however we both know that the ministrys responsibility is to provide longrange industrial planning they often circulate scenarios for comment its part of their job we were rapidly losing our footing noda was topranked swordsman hed kept his discipline and revealed nothing he was telling us we hadnt found an opening he was right it was a classic standoff or it should have been strategically we should have taken that moment to back away and analyze nodas style searching for his weakness but instead tam made what turned out to be a fatal move she struck exposing herself since according to you miti is not involved in this program there should be no problem if i contacted them directly and talked this over in japan i wanted to yell no dont tell him anything but it was too late an excellent idea he nodded gravely then turned to me do you intend to be part of this expedition as well mr walton what to do the only moves left now were defensive no way was i going to let tam face the beast alone also if noda had me he wouldnt need amy i assume you can spare me here for a few days but we will all be in japan together he removed his thin wireless spectacles that is in fact the very matter i needed to discuss with you it is time you both were brought more closely into the matters at hand beginning today ive already made reservations on new york helicopter departing for kennedy in two hours from the east thirtyfourth street heliport he had us hed seized the initiative feinted us off balance and defined the terms she tried to recover when and where we go is something we intend to ah dr richardson one must seize the moment it is past time you and mr walton understood more fully the many levels of concern involved here there are a number of things you need to see he smiled as he replaced his glasses because of the expected frequency of my travels in the coming months i have just leased a concorde we refuel in bahrain ive been looking forward to having you both as my guests the answer is no mr walton i urge you not to forgo this opportunity too rashly he looked me over in fact since you are known to be an authority on japanese arms i could even arrange for you to have a firsthand look at the imperial sword forget it but the timing couldnt be more ideal at the moment the sword has just been transferred to one of the metallurgy labs at tsukuba science city for minor repair work since tsukuba is to be our destination as well i can just telex the imperial household and instruct them to arrange a viewing date he smiled again for a connoisseur such as yourself nothing would please me more there was something about the way he said it i dont know maybe a strange glimmer flashed through his eyes looking back i think that was the moment i first should have realized matsuo noda had decided he was god you didnt hear me were not leaving now at least not on your terms mr walton i really must insist he glanced over at tam what i intend to show you should be of extreme interest to you both ill go when im ready she turned and headed for the door dr richardson im afraid we all have no alternative he spoke quietly his tone masking the harshness as he continued these offices have been sealed as a temporary security measure there appears to have been an unauthorized access to the nec mainframe here however ive decided to postpone criminal charges for the moment he smiled again besides the time has come for you both to know everything we were on our way i looked out of the window on my side down through the haze covering new yorks east river just below us and took tams hand the ny chopper was a sikorski st twin engine two pilots events were moving so fast it was hard even to think no doubt about one thing though wed been outmaneuvered outplanned outfought the only good part was he had me as hostage not amy in a final faceoff with noda whatever he had in mind i still figured i could take care of myself miti and all the battle had just begun when we walked out of nodas office there was no longer any mistaking the new security arrangements dai nippon was on red alert well matthew looks like were about to get the big picture like it or not on nodas terms which wasnt the way it was supposed to happen i just need to confront ken for whatever good it may do i found myself thinking we were kneedeep in confrontations and we still didnt know a damned thing what did noda have planned for us whatever it was i had a strong feeling i didnt want it back in my own office at dai nippon there was only time for one phone call the first name that came to mind was joanna i wanted to say look if i dont make it through this you and amy are well provided for shes got a trust fund thats seven figures and you can have the house the bank account the whole damn works just dont ever let a man named matsuo noda anywhere near you or her but i couldnt force myself to dial the number it wasnt joanna who was in over her head now it was me the subtle or notsosubtle difference was enough to stop me cold id vowed to manage life on my own and this was no moment to waffle so instead i did the next best thing and called the west side free schoolwhich i might add may have been free in its disdain for classical curriculum but it had very nonfree tuition practices i identified myself announced an emergency and asked to speak to ms amy walton in about a minute she was there dad were in the middle of our monday geo exam she lowered her voice whats the capital of somalia honey havent a clue just try and do the best you can employ that exceptional brain of yours thanks adults dont have to know the capitals of third world countries thats a small perk we get for putting up with old age i paused amy about this weekend uh oh she sighed betcha i know whats next well a problems come up ive got to take care of a few things dad the snow leopards this weekend is when theyre supposed to honey well hit the bronx zoo the minute i get back i absolutely promise you going off somewhere just a quick trip where she perked up well talk about it when i get back i wanted to say if i get back big secret huh amy i just wanted to darling be careful whats the matter dad are you in some kind of trouble how could i answer damned right i was but that wasnt the point of the call sweetie just just be especially careful thats all ill try my best to make it up to you at christmas maybe we can still get down to the islands somehow and amy yeah i love you honey love you too dad look i gotta get back im sure ms winters will give you some extra time dont bet on it shes an old grouch shes twentyeight and an old maid twentyeight old good god i keep forgetting what its like to be thirteen and think of the future as the next three weeks followed by a gaping void sweetheart thats not exactly ancient believe me shes probably still got half a dozen good years left tell her look ive gotta run all right just advise your mother something unexpected came up maybe you and i can make it next weekend well do the snow leopards thats an absolute guarantee great so long dad have fun i almost said goodbye bad luck i thought so instead i said take care shortly thereafter matsuo noda tam richardson and yours truly were headed over to new york helicopters midtown pad one of nodas bodyguards in the limo with us the battle was drawn now as i looked down at the boroughs of new york gliding below all those little strings of metallic beads lined up on the ribbons of asphalt the backyards of new yorks solid middle class glimmering with remnants of snow i found myself wondering what noda had planned for them another imponderable still nagged at me as well what about akira mori tam reported that by the time shed arrived at the dni offices this morning our friend had vanished ditto her informationpacked attache case as quickly as the lady had come shed disappeared back to tokyo but not with noda shed gone on her own terms was he now using his new concorde to try and head her off what had she been doing here just handdelivering mitis latest guidance maybe we were finally about to uncover everybodys real agenda again my mind went back to ken and kan miyamoto musashis famous discourse on mental attitude in the way of the warrior which he called heiho kokoro mochi no koto what was merely appearances ken and what was kan the global picture the essence noda had temporarily gained the upper hand but now i realized that was almost to be expected after all he was a swordsman with decades of experience so much for ken my superficial observation the real truth kan lay much deeper and like all such truths it had to be elementary elegantly simple which left only two possibilities either matsuo noda was merely an insane genius about to show us the inner workings of the massive organization he now controlled or he planned to kill us or both chapter twenty dr kenji asano gazed out the window of his office at the institute the last shafts of sun casting long shadows in the canyons below it was late tuesday afternoon and gales of december wind tunneled around the skyscrapers of tokyo chilling the gray steel and glass the blank computer screens reflected back his smooth trim face his glum eyes technology it was divorcing man from all sensibility what kenji asano found himself wanting at that moment was not hightech but hightouch to be seated on the tatami of his tokyo teahouse smelling the fresh straw gazing out over the manicured evergreen shrubs of his garden the clumps of leafless black bamboo he recalled again the tea ceremony in kyoto and the sight of tamara approaching down the stepping stones of the dewy path she was a rare american one who understood the essence of chanoyuinner power shows itself in outer restraint as he lit a peace cigarette with a wooden match and continued to examine the cheerless skyline of tokyo a thought flickered pastbodhidharma the first zen master who had plucked away his eyelids to prevent sleep as he meditated that reflection led naturally to ruminations on the masters disciple huiko who sat zazen for days in the snows outside shaolin monastery then finally severed his own arm and offered it to the master as testament of his devotion bushido the code of the samurai who today would cut off an arm to prove determination or be benkei at the bridge the servant who breaks the rules of society and cudgels his own master to protect their disguise and deceive their foes that famous episode he told himself would be his model sometimes bushido required you to circumvent tradition and honor for the greater good what was happening in japan these days many thoughtful japanese were expressing open concern even fear over their countrys rising nationalism although high officials still couched their flagwaving in coded language intended to elude foreign notice many prominent voices were now suggesting its wrong to think prewar japan was all bad the latest school textbooks spoke glowingly of the countrys imperial traditions encouraged by this jingoism in truth veiled racism many superpatriots were beginning to emerge from obscurity now with the imperial sword as symbol the japanese right was openly on the march surely noda had known it would happen had counted on it he recalled the line by yeats and what rough beast its hour come round at last the beast kenji asano feared had arisen in japan and its monstrous head was none other than matsuo noda who could have suspected the dark side of nodas grand design or the extent of his determination violence money in the billions and accomplices where they were least suspected perhaps even inside miti this last disturbing prospect had convinced kenji asano that the time for operating within the rules was past he had already taken a first step aided unwittingly by a bureaucrat of immense ambition within the ministry his first counterploy against noda had bought timehow much he didnt know but the next move must be decisive he glanced around his office then at the miti reports stacked high on his desk benkei at the bridge for kenji asano only one course was left he would now have to use his own master miti to destroy matsuo noda his mind went back to the meeting at his miti office monday of the previous week although he was on temporary assignment at the institute he still checked in daily at the ministry filing into his office at ninethirty sharp had been the three men whose consensus was crucial the difficulty was they must never know what he planned michio watanabe international trade policy bureau trade research section heavyset early fifties a professional bureaucrat with powerful eyes and a permanent expression of skepticism he had been a close colleague of nodas for decades tanzan kitano industrial policy bureau international enterprises section gray hair tinged with silver immaculate dresser spoke five languages he had been in miti over twenty years and had maintained the same mistress for fifteen a man respected for his longrange thinking hiromu ikeda industrial technology agency late thirties thrived on expediency doing the job no matter the consequences part of a hard new breed he was japans future and mlti was his future while the men moved toward the wide couch across from his desk kenji asano opened with offhand pleasantries directed mainly toward watanabe partly because he was eldest and partly to sound out his mindstate next he welcomed kitano with a few inquiries concerning his wife and son a transparent formality since he was known far and wide to despise them both finally he greeted ikeda and indicated the meeting would be short knowing the younger man liked to move directly to matters at hand and regarded the usual preliminaries as an oldfashioned waste of time agenda the american companies matsuo noda was acquiring a proposition had surfaced in japanese bureaucracies all ideas are anonymous and thus devoid of repercussions that certain miti personnel be put on leave of absence to serve on the boards of those us concerns given the heavy participation of japanese monies in nodas american program perhaps a more formal monitoring mechanism would be helpful to head off potential anxiety in tokyos financial community the idea of course was kenji asanos he had first laid the groundwork with a few oblique hints to several of dai nippons major institutional backers particularly the daiichi credit corporation ltd that move had borne fruit within days they had begun wondering aloud whether the ministry might wish to consider helping oversee nodas american investments so far so good now miti itself had to be convinced this meeting would undoubtedly be the first of many resulting eventually in a consensus would the ministry go along having set forth the topic kenji asano surrendered the floor to watanabe the senior man presentand therefore the one whose views in keeping with convention would be listened to and applauded by everyone else in the room whether they agreed or not in my judgment the original objectives of matsuo noda and dai nippon are the most desirable means of maintaining the longterm security of japan watanabe declared it is in our strategic interest that he be allowed to succeed which is why miti should stay handsoff should limit its participation to an advisory capacity nothing more anything further could well prove extremely counterproductive in our relations with the united states we do not need more friction so deshoo watanabesan kitano the man second in seniority nodded after a moments pause i totally concur with the basic aspects of the viewpoint you have expressed he was telling everybody he hadnt made up his mind i also support fully watanabesans insightful summary of the relevant issues ikeda spoke up his honorifics far more polite than necessary a signal keredomo however it might possibly be prudent to examine briefly the considerations advanced by those who differ with this wise assessment in order that we may counter their concerns more thoughtfully that was it kenji asano had a head count watanabe was against sending miti personnel kitano was waffling hiromu ikeda was foursquare and hellbent in favor of the idea he had just announced it to the room was watanabe in league with noda willing to give him free rein was he one of nodas operatives inside the ministry or was he merely advancing his own ideas genuinely fearful an influx of miti personnel into the us could precipitate a severe diplomatic flap on the other hand why was ikeda so in favor of having miti move in on noda the answer to that was hardly a puzzle mitis young prince of ambition hiromu ikeda scented the possibility of grabbing a part of matsuo nodas new american empire for his own handled skillfully it might well catapult him directly to vice minister inside a decade perhaps it would be useful to review once more the main elements of the situation kitano knew he had the middle ground and thus was offering to arbitrate the condition of america now is very troubling the question is how can we best aid them and ourselves we in japan realize that a nations true strength is ultimately not in armaments but in the health of its economy its industry yet the americans by making themselves a military state have paradoxically imperiled their real security how long can we continue to rely on an ally so blind to the main threat to its own strategic well being matsuo noda is correct our very safety may soon be imperiled something must be done the only question is how best to proceed so desu ne watanabe pressed realizing he would have to force his point the pentagon is ironically americas most insidious enemy japans greatest benefit from americas defense umbrella has not been the billions weve saved on sterile arms it has been the technical manpower we have free to support competitive industries but the price has been the industrial decline of our foremost ally this cannot must not be permitted to continue he paused matsuo noda a man ive known and respected for years who guided this ministry to greatness should be allowed to assist the americans rebuild their civilian sector unhindered by us if miti involves itself at this time the american government may well grow alarmed and step in to stop him then their industrial stagnation will merely accelerate so deshoo ikeda finally spoke i agree unfortunately however there are some who believe the task nodasama has undertaken cannot succeed without direct miti assistance again it is a matter of our own security the question has arisen concerning whether we should continue to rely on the americans to rescue their industrial base unassisted by any formal direction of course i disagree with such pessimistic views but some would say we ourselves must now step forward and assume global leadership in technology to prevent a vacuum from developing in the free world by taking charge of americas floundering hightech sector we could rescue it from continued mismanagement whileincidentallysatisfying our own r ampd needs in a way that is extremely cost effective however this can only be achieved if we are in a position to provide handson guidance which means direct miti involvement he paused these opinions of course are not my own merely ones i have heard voiced i am told though it is difficult to comprehend that this viewpoint has been entertained by nakayamasama of the secretariat and even discussed in his weekly conference with the parliamentary vice minister the hand of fate asano exulted hiromu ikeda has already done my work for me hes gone over everybodys head he swallowed the idea like a carp snapping a hovering dragonfly then went off and peddled it to the vice minister as though it were his own a man to watch out for in the future he thought but a perfect ally at the moment watanabe said nothing his ancient face was in shock everybody realized the meeting was over it was clear ikeda had trampled on consensus and seniority in order to further his own fortunes watanabesan i think we all agree your understanding of the situation is entirely proper kenji asano said soothingly but solely in the interest of continued theoretical discussion at some later time it might be prudent if all sections prepared a contingency list of staff fluent in english who would be suitable for reassignment to an american sector it is always wise to cover contingencies asanosan watanabe said dryly none of them realized it of course but hiromu ikedas ambition could well turn out to be the salvation of miti itself but for now asano mused that was something none of them needed to know looking out the window at the freezing streets below glimmering from headlights and neon kenji asano told himself that a dangerous game lay ahead nodas first gambit had been countered but there would be more what he needed was a preemptive strike he had made the plans for that strike a play of pure absolute genius the catch was tamara would have to cooperate with that thought he reached down and unlocked the top righthand drawer of his metal desk then drew out a large red and blue envelope it was air express from a university address in california as he fingered the stripes along its side he recalled how it had arrived here at his office at the institute for new generation computer technology while hed been in kyoto with tamara finally he opened it again and slipped out the contents inside was a confidential memo on the old nippon inc letterhead unsigned but obviously authored by matsuo noda a topsecurity document that had been clocked in at a document station at tsukuba science city how had allan stern stumbled onto this had he stolen it picked it up by accident it was in japanese so how could he have sensed its real import american ingenuity he told himself defied all understanding the memo which outlined the timetable for a massive scenario had been the first step of a long path of discovery leading kenji asano to indisputable proof of matsuo nodas real objective allan stern must have had this translated or somehow intuitively guessed nodas plan and then allan stem had tried to warn miti why out of past regard for dr yoshida former head of the institute and a close friend stern reportedly had vanished the same day this envelope was postmarked noda had acted but not swiftly enough who at miti had been the original recipient of this memo maybe he thought it no longer mattered there was only one real way to stop dai nippon at that moment his phone buzzed as he punched the button his flustered secretary announced that an inflight call was waiting channeled through mitis satellite security link it was the president of dai nippon international chapter twentyone tsukuba science city can be aweinspiring or a specter depending on how you choose to look at it the time was wednesday morning and tam and i were viewing the place through the tinted windows of matsuo nodas personal dni limo the black nissan she knew so well from the vantage of an elevated freeway packed with rows of sleek hondas and toyotas sparkling in the cold december sunshine we could see the silhouettes of cluster after cluster of modernistic concrete towers an urban complex of a hundred and fifty thousand souls rising above what was only a few short years ago mostly farms be that as it may take my word for it that nobodys growing radishes there today science city nestled in the foothills of mt tsukuba some fifty kilometers northeast of downtown tokyo represents a government investment including the industrial park once the site of expo of over thirty billion dollars tsukuba is holy ground the place of heroes where kamikazes once trained for their suicide missions against the american fleet now it is one of the largest research centers in the world with almost ten thousand scientists and fifty separate laboratories and scientific institutes as we neared the first complex i tried to make sense of all the daliesque curved buildings that housed japans new brain trust from the outside you can tell something is going on but it seems secretive and proprietary it is the thing i had to keep reminding myself though was that none of this was for military boondoggles it was aimed deadon at industrial technology eg theres research here on highenergy lasers all right but theyre not intended for zapping some hypothetical soviet satellite theyre part of the worlds largest laserradar telescope which can project beams out more than thirty miles to analyze air quality in short the work here was applicationsoriented practical andget a firm grip on your wallet commercial together with noda and his bodyguardchauffeur we were headed for the electrotechnical institute where he was about to give us our first glimpse of japans new hightech empire that lab just so happened to be the place where heavy work was underway on applications of the artificial intelligence effort of kenji asanos fifth generation shop it was merely the first stop however in an odyssey noda claimed would take us through the hidden heart of japans industrial future noda reported he had spoken with kenji asano who was unfortunately tied up in meetings and couldnt join us until tomorrow thus tam had not yet had her chance to hear his account of mitis sudden new interest in dai nippons program all the same noda claimed to welcome kens arrival whatever concerns you may have im sure he will be more than happy to address them declared the president of dai nippon tam had tried on her own to reach ken at his office without success maybe i thought to myself he just didnt want to talk in any case that quandary remained unresolved the way i saw the situation though we had enough to deal with merely getting through today nodas game was no longer a game he was going to take us to the top of the mountain show us the other side and then what whatever it was that part would have to be handled in due time for now his intentions seemed to be to drive home a singular point if you think dai nippon has been playing hardball with money wait till you see japans real action he was going to lay bare the empire the awesome machine he now had at his command the payoff of tsukuba he explained was intended to be nothing less than total technological supremacy the limo was slowing to a stop in front of an oddly shaped concrete building brandnew that covered several acres with cones and hexagons and various geometries wed arrived this is the electrotechnical institute research center for japans advanced robot technology project he pointed the laboratory appeared to be somebodys idea of what architecture would be in the twentyfirst century a sort of japanese spaceship splattered across a vast acreage the work underway here and over at the mechanical engineering lab is intended to coordinate all government and private research on industrial robots he stepped out and motioned for us to join him our top secret tour had begun as we walked toward the main entryway he delivered an opening summary here we have allocated twenty billion yen about a hundred and fifty million dollars for an eightyear research program to perfect a range of industrial robots he continued while we walked past the small gray metallic sign in both japanese and english that identified the institute it is being closely coordinated with the spinoffs of the fifth generation ai work i noticed that no guards were posted though the metal doors were tightly sealed noda didnt bother to take out a key as he proceeded the advanced robot technology project coordinates the research of over twenty corporations as well as r ampd at various universities and this lab is where we integrate all the results of that work you mean different parts or robots are being created at separate research operations then brought together here i probably shouldnt have been surprised by the tight nationwide coordination typical japan precisely robots have a multiplicity of elements there are manipulators the mechanical versions of our hands then there are the senses of vision and touch and finally there is movement locomotion each of these is being developed individually then combined here for example if a robot is to understand voice commandsin effect making its operator a programmerthen it must incorporate the speech recognition work of the fifth generation project which will supply the eyes the ears the brain maybe thats where asano comes in i thought could it be hes the point man here for artificial intelligence on board to oversee creating the computerized brains for all these babies was he yet another dni operative witting or unwitting just as tam and i had been nodas lecture was still underway the first generation of robots does things by rote the same motion repeated dumbly over and over again what we call the second generation are those with crude sensing abilities perhaps touch pads or video though they are still stationary he placed his hand over a small screen by the door a light flashed under his palmpresumably allowing a computer somewhere to analyze his handprintand a second later the door slid open then he continued the goal of the work here is a thirdgeneration robot you might almost call it a functional android since it will be able to move see and think much as we do whether it will actually look like a human is another matter but thats not necessarily even a useful objective intelligent monsters in silicon and steel i found myself thinking all our fantasies or nightmares come to life i didnt have to look far to see that they were already in the womb we were entering the main laboratory floor now surrounded by what seemed a martian landscape of mechanical creatures the place was bustling yet spotless as a hospital ward noda acknowledged the deep bows of several of the shirtsleeved staff then continued although visitors are not normally permitted in the sensitive areas here i have arranged totalaccess priority for you both i consider you among the few americans today who can understand the strategic significance of this program if matsuo noda was really saying that he intended to give us a sobering dose of japans impending hightech clout he was off to a bangup start then he turned and greeted a short whiteuniformed man allow me to introduce dr noburu matsugami who is senior staff specialist for the program here dr matsugami will be your guide today matsugami was close to fifty and balding with short cropped hair that seemed to stand out on the sides of his head like the bristles of a metal brush he was bowing to noda every other second as though hed just been summoned by god he attempted a smile then greeted us in japanese followed by accented english i surveyed the floorsteel and aluminum and computers feeling as if i could have been on another planet tam strangely had said scarcely a word the whole time she probably knew about a lot of this but surely not the proprietary advanced devices nodas glimpse of japans industrial manhattan project was one of the most memorable experiences of my life although i suspect the devices he let matsugami show us were just the toys they still were enough to leave no doubt where things were headed without going into the classified details let me attempt to describe a few of the items i still remember i was particularly impressed by the waseda universityhitachi walking robot whlii which uses advanced machine technology and computer control to move just as a human does twolegged style its hydraulic steel joints and carbonfiber muscles together with its computerized foot sensors give it walking skills better than most young humans its brain of course is a microprocessor programmed to let it walk in different styles just as we do other mobile robots had four legs even sixsuch as the titan iii which we saw climb up a set of stairs like a metallic scifi spider as for robot hands the most advanced also were from hitachis mechanical engineering research lab unlike most robot grippers little more than glorified vises this one had three fingers which matsugami claimed were more agile than a version at mit whose muscles were a heatsensitive metal invented in the us that would contract when an electric current passed through vision research was also well advanced a matsushita robot equipped with a computerized eye was able to analyze the lines and shadows of a human face and then draw a blackand white sketch like a sidewalk artist even more amazing a robot with a tvcamera eyedeveloped jointly by waseda university and sumitomo electriccould read sheet music and play it on a keyboard using mechanical fingers this android pianist employed recent advances in artificial intelligence to determine the best fingering for each phrase and even took requests for tunes in spoken japanese play it again hal other robots with voice recognition capability allowed a human operator simply to sit in one spot and command the mobile machine where to go and what to do at one point tam asked matsugami for a candid opinion on how far along he thought the advanced robottechnology program had progressed well he replied sucking in his breath pensively the manual dexterity problem was about licked the robot arms now being perfected could pick up anything and move it anywhere vision and programmable intelligence were harder but he felt their research was getting close already he had robots that could analyze and interpret d objects and scenes enabling them to maneuver around a factory floor and make decisions of almost human complexity the ultimate objective was factorywide systems for computerintegrated manufacturing cim that would allow every operation of a company from design to engineering to manufacturing to be controlled by computer via a single data base it was cheap and it elevated quality control to a hundred percent no doubt about it he said as japan moved to automate manufacturing and get on with an information industry future these smart robots would be their secret weapon the institutes mechanical menagerie i realized was what the next century was going to look like except it was here now as matsugami took us through lab after lab it became clear that the japanese thirdgeneration functionoid robot was all but a reality nodas message was clear already japan was spending twice as much on new manufacturing technology as america was they led the world in robotics and that lead was growing with the coming of that third generationrobots that could see move and thinkworld industrial leadership would be up for grabs these were the stakes japan was betting on the twentyfirst century anybody who planned to play against them better have something on the table too at the end of the tour as dusk was beginning to settle in noda reappeared and escorted us back to the limo and thats when he laid it out dr richardson what you and mr walton have just seen is merely a glimpse of the real peril to americas future he was closing the door of the car there is much much more projects such as the rapid commercialization of superconductivity americas world supremacy is at a crossroads why are you showing us this tam was still troubled by the same question that was eating at me very simple really thus far we have together attempted to address some of the more egregious ineptitudes in americas corporate management our success in that if i may say has already been substantial however the bestmanaged organization cannot flourish without the tools required to take it the next step that translates as technology he paused then looked at us both do you understand what im saying japan now has the technology just as it has the money tam answered you are correct thus far dai nippon has merely provided a conduit to infuse capital into the american industrial scene that was the easy part the task remaining will be much more difficult he looked at us difficult because for this america must share in return you want to make a deal i take it i finally spoke funny but i thought i sounded a little like faust beginning negotiations with the devil he smiled that is a blunt way of describing what i am about to suggest mr walton but it does capture the spirit of my proposal america excels in basic research japan in applied research in engineering the time has come to join forces how as you have seen the monetary resources at dai nippons disposal make it possible for us to wield significant influence he smiled japanese capital has been brought to america japanese technology can be brought as well at a price at a price yes but a modest one really he smiled again then buzzed for his driver to start the car let me put it like this if you choose to proceed with me in the next step of dai nippons program i will arrange for everything you have seen today to be my gift to america all i ask from you both is complete cooperation in the days ahead together we can forge an informal alliance between japan and america that could alter the course of world history but it must be done in an atmosphere of complete trust tam was astonished youd make this manufacturing technology available to american industry why as part of a quid pro quo dr richardson its quite simple in return i would expect complete access to the r ampd in the firms dai nippon has acquired he stared back through his rimless glasses which i gather is a notion you find a trifle unsettling you bastard i thought you did have my phone tapped how else could you have known what she was thinking she shot me a telling glance how does all this fit in with the new miti guidance were suddenly getting that is a separate matter dr richardson which we will address in due course what i am concerned with now is something else entirelythe final step in restoring america to economic health the first requirement was longterm capital and better management which dai nippon has now begun to provide the next is technology a small foretaste of which i have shown you today was this i wondered the big picture the kan wed been trying to get a handle on what im proposing noda continued is that together we become partners in the creation of a massive japanese american consortium perhaps we could call it nipponica nipponica she kept her tone even the name has an interesting ring to it does it not as i envision the organization you would be its american ceo he paused i would chair the board then he turned to me and you mr walton could be invaluable as chief corporate counsel the man had gone totally mad or had he i still dont understand how this venture could be brought together youd be dealing with hundreds of companies a worldwide management headache mr walton what other choice do we have given the precipitous decline of americas global leadership together with japans economic and technological rise there can be only two possible outcomes of the inevitable direction affairs are headed bankruptcy for us both or war the time has come for risktaking for a belief in the human spirit we each need the other more than our political leaders can allow themselves to admit and thus steps must be taken outside normal diplomatic channels to bring us closer together he continued in perfect form both america and japan would benefit from a commingling of our industry and research we would learn from each other find strength in unity realize a common perspective on global concerns our economies would be joined our peoples united instead of friction and the saber rattling of trade disputes we would have the harmony of a single enterprise who exactly is going to finance and operate this undertaking i was listening to him describe his plannedfor utopia with increasing skepticism but he had already rocked america and japan to the core not a man to underestimate as you might suppose dai nippon would by virtue of its present situation be ideally suited to lay the groundwork he glanced out the tinted windows afterward the political processes of both countries would naturally have no choice but to follow our lead ratifyingas they always doconditions that have already become a fait accompli it had all the easy resonance of a grand historical venture except except what if this was still ken superficialities not kan the real truth before we go any further i think dr richardson and i should talk this over i looked up to see the tsukuba hotel where we were scheduled to stay overnight noda had made other accommodations for himself saying he also needed to drop by the metallurgy lab and check to see how work was going on the sword my scheduled viewing was to be tomorrow i agree tam looked at me sharply we can discuss this more in the morning as you wish the limo was pulling to a stop tomorrow should be an interesting day for you both we can continue our discussions then he smiled however be aware that time is of the essence with that parting shot the long black nissan sped away tam lets see if this place has a bar i need a drink double she was carrying the small overnight bag nodas new york staff had handed her as we left i had one too just a shirt and essentials the hotel saloon was modernistic vinyl and leaned heavily toward japanese beer and suntory whiskey by now some middlelevel executives were getting off work at the labs and dropping in to start their usual evening round of drinking but at this early hour it was still sparsely occupied we headed for a comer table and ordered a couple of draft kirin after the beers arrived we got down to brass tacks what the hell was nodas real agenda two heads so the saying goes are better than one i dont know could be theyre worse because as tam and i sat there nodas offer to head up some kind of new world consortium dangling before us what our two heads came up with was the scariest thing thatd ever crossed my path maybe it was the thought of americas working stiffs whose jobs noda supposedly was so determined to save trouble was i didnt buy that in the slightest anymore so what made any sense simple why not the most obvious answer of all noda wasnt doing this for them or for japan that wasnt his game noda was planning this grand design for noda tam i sipped at my beer did you believe a word of what he said of course not at least not the united nations speech its pure hogwash totally agree but hes about to do something big im convinced got any ideas luckily the place was getting noisier now so nobody could have been listening even if theyd tried which was the very reason i wanted to talk in the bar and not in either of our rooms who knew the reach of nodas electronic ears not really but what if we stepped back a second and tried looking at this latest move from a longer view maybe weve been tangled up in the trees missing the forest weve seen plenty of forest lately but what if its the wrong one lets try the teki ni naru to iu koto strategy become the enemy pretend for a minute were noda a guy whos got it allmoney clout everything so why does he all of a sudden want to come across the pacific and buy himself a load of industrial headaches then hand them japans technology its miti somehow im convinced thats the key which is why im going to nail ken well lets not jump to conclusions im wondering what if dai nippon is taking over american industry not because its strategic to miti as those memos we found would lead us to think what if the reason is because its strategic to noda but why what if his relationship to that ministry is something totally different from what it seems well if mitis not behind the buyups then whore they for i sat a minute again trying to think like noda what if this scenario is actually aimed at what if its a global power play she looked at me skeptically i dont get it okay granted it sounds crazy but lets chase that for a minute i think we agree this whole scenario is not what he wants it to seem so what are some of the other things in all this that arent what they appear to be does anything dovetail i sat musing a second searching for an opening what are some of the twists about japan thatre obviously misleading well acceptance of gaijin for one it goes only so far then stops like a brick wall she was obviously speaking from personal experience maybe thats because theyve always been isolated some things never change i pondered aloud which is probably the secret of their success take the ruling clique sure japan is a democracy but is it really not the way we understand the word what they actually have after you get past all the slogans is just a retread of the old system the truth is its still run as it was a thousand years ago by the old families the old money elections never decide issues theyre handled by the power structure half the seats in the diet are practically hereditary going back generations in the same family theres only one real political party the ministries are fiefdoms i mean the goddam country is still feudal they dont even have a word for democracy they had to borrow it demokurasu well japans a pragmatic place the old ways work remember the zaibatsu those industrial conglomerates that ran the war machine macarthur dismantled them but they reappeared almost as soon as he left right the power structure restored those right away the zaibatsu are back and chewing up world commerce but the demokurasu eyewash is still around the jobs not finished she stared around the room matt i dont like where i think youre headed i agree its sick but lets push it a little more what is it about japan thats made it such a dynamo the last couple of decades hard work organization drive exactly but where did that come from they had to have it over the centuries most japanese were dirt poor they had to hustle just to survive matthew japan is a collectivist society driven by capitalism an idea so alien to the west nobody can even see it perfect description only problem is all this demokurasu is sooner or later going to start cutting away the very thing thats made japan so successfula country powered by obedient collective action and glued together by hierarchy and tradition youre saying noda wants to turn back the clock dont know but what if these industrialists these zaibatsu honchos are fed up with having to deal with all the cumbersome demokurasu machinery and theyre especially fed up with a certain ministry making them jump the hoop tam what if nodas real agenda is to go to america and buy himself a gun to hold to mitis head you dont think hes buying americas companies to help miti she looked unconvinced if i had money to bet id almost be willing to put it on the possibility hes buying leverage to use against miti and through them the whole inefficient government setup how come mitis suddenly sending staff over to look in on nodas play could it be somebody theres figured out what hes up to and they want to head him off they realize matsuo noda is the only man on the planet who could conceivably beat miti at its own game bring it to its knees first he acquired control of half the capital in japan then he came to the us and started grabbing up all the r ampd thatll be competing with miti through the end of the century when hes got it hell have a power base to match theirs hes set to call the new tune which is who knows but try this for an agenda time to cut the crap nodas thinking get rid of all the clumsy westernstyle demokurasu charade tighten up lean and mean go back to the only system thats ever really clicked for japan imperial rule make the land of the gods sacred and invincible this is getting wild she lowered her voice but maybe maybe you could be right he just happens to locate the imperial sword and suddenly the emperor is resurrected from a discredited figurehead back to a symbol of japans greatness here comes that oldtime religion everybody goes traditional right on cue and the nutty japan firsters are thriving again just like the thirties good lord doesnt it all fit somehow matsuo noda started off by creating this shadow outfit dai nippon in order to get his hands on all his countrymens money now the next step will be to start phasing out the demokurasu frills and the powerless prime minister and the miti bureaucrats and turning the place into a kickass machine again look out world one small problem the emperor cant rule japan not really hes a living god which means see that difficultys nothing new for a thousand years the emperors had no real clout anyway the nittygritty of running japan was always the job of his standin there was a long pause we both avoided speaking the word but there it was finally she leaned back and closed her eyes her voice barely audible above the din of the bar shogun chapter twentytwo komban wa tamara the voice emerged from the dark as her key turned in the door of room how are you ken good to see you again how did you he chuckled as he switched on the light by the chair rank in miti has its moments i thought you were coming tomorrow i am officially he rose and moved toward her but tonight id hoped we could be together he smiled alone she stood in the open doorway unmoving ken we have a lot to talk about all right she closed the door and i dont mean in bed truthfully she wasnt even sure she wanted to see him at all the dai nippon scenario was getting too complicated too insidious nodas play was turning into something with worldwide implications tamara i came because we need to talk i think youre in danger maybe we both are from noda just because hes a megalomaniac you think its that simple he interrupted dont be so sure for now lets just say hes very very clever and very powerful he reached out to welcome her but whatever he is the time has come to stop him i think matt and i just figured out why hes a threat to miti isnt he ken a peril to your power base hes a threat to everybody but yes miti is definitely in his way at this point or at least im in his way somebody has to be so what do you expect me to do about it as a matter of fact what has miti done for me lately except try and move in on my work tam you cant stand up to noda alone but maybe together we can at least for a while what makes you think i have a weapon at my disposal a powerful weapon the ministry if we can use it to focus attention on what hes how i want to speed up the ministrys involvement bring in lots more people we do that and well i see she slipped past him and headed for the second chair thats a terrific idea give it all to miti for a moment there shed almost been ready to start trusting him again tam we only have to make it seem thats what is happening he turned to face her itll be like waving a red flag under the nose of your congress surely thatll wake everybody up to what hes doing theyd move in and stop him cold guaranteed ken matsuo noda made me a very intriguing proposition today matter of fact it sounds better than yours she got up and walked over to the small refrigerator fitted under the sink want a beer im going to have one all right he looked at her what were you saying just now about a proposition noda asked me to head up a japaneseamerican consortium run as a single industry its almost as if he wants to put together an american version of miti an organization that can oversee and coordinate american r ampd nationwide do you believe he means what he says she turned and stared at him for a moment i guess the honest answer is no i think its just a smokescreen to get his hands on everything he wants in the us disguised under the rubric of assistance she retrieved two cans of cold asahi and popped the tops on the other hand youre suggesting we have to give americas industry to miti in order to save it from matsuo noda she extended a can of beer and a glass right now i dont trust miti any more than i trust him tamara this is a highstakes game against a man with more money and power than the world has ever seen in one place its not going to be easy to stop him its also going to be risky for us both and you think a miti takeover is the answer its the only thing thats left he sobered unfortunately itll also damage mitis political credibility badly worldwide but thats the price im willing to pay to stop noda what other choice is there hurt miti im not so sure taking over all of dnis american research labs should give quite a boost to your marketshare program wouldnt it youd be acquiring americas hightech sector for japan all nicely wrapped up in a bundle she poured from her can ought to trim years off your timetable i dont know where you heard about that tam vague surprise in his voice but thats not a real program market share is just a planning exercise over in the general affairs section part of some training for their new people when we asked noda about it he seemed to think it was real enough then he was just bluffing he had to be ken what do you take me for she wasnt sure how much more doubletalk she could stand he waved his hand to stop her please just trust me for this once thats all i ask youre sure as hell not making it easy i think its time you told me whats really going on all right ill show you the bottom line maybe then youll accept the truth he got up and went over to his briefcase i have something in here you ought to see what its an advance text of the speech his majesty delivers on january second thats his annual new years appearance at the imperial palace right when he bestows his blessings upon the land exactly he pulled out the sheet i think this sheds light on a lot of things here i made a rough english translation just to hear how it sounds she took the paper torn from a yellow legal pad and began to read the speech began with a longwinded celebration of the famous yasukuni shrine home of the spirits of all japanese warriors that shrine his majesty then went on to declare was increasingly misconstrued by the world as a symbol of japanese militarism a misapprehension both unfortunate and untrue since japan had indeed renounced martial force forever however to reinforce that commitment in the eyes of a nervous world he was now announcing the dedication of a new national shrine to japans spirit that would have no such misleading overtones this new shrine at tsukuba science city would be a memorial to the peaceful use of technology to mans mastery of the physical world sanctified so long ago by the shinto gods she looked up a new national shrine nice political move better read the rest before you jump to conclusions she glanced down and continued on it had further been decided the emperor would say that the newly recovered imperial sword would not be housed at ise after all it would instead be the centerpiece of this new memorial to japanese technology well she thought it still sounds okay theme shrines are perfectly within tradition after all the meiji shrine in tokyo commemorated the nineteenthcentury emperor who began japans modernization however the thing to remember was that new shrines can have a philosophical subtext the meiji told the japanese that their country had accepted westernization so given that the creation of a new shrine can embody a message to everybody she found herself wondering what word was being sent out this time the emperor would go on to spell this out lest any of his subjects were too dense to get the picture unlike the yasukuni shrine he would say this new memorial at tsukuba would not commemorate japans warrior past rather it would celebrate a modern japan whose world eminence would be fashioned not with arms but through economic struggle in so doing it would symbolize the regeneration of japans ancient spirit yamato damashi of which the bushido of the samurai was merely one manifestation only a stage grander things were on the way japans rightful place in the new world order was only now coming into its own the new tsukuba damashi would harness modern technology to japans ancient traditions would put the new at the service of the old what he was really telling his people she realized in oblique language only they would comprehend was that japan was now prepared to wage open confrontation through commercetheir trading state pitted against the worlds military states whose economic base and martial ascendancy they would now proceed to challenge through technological superiority and cutthroat trade ken does this mean what i think it means she passed back the yellow page if you think it means nodas got him now then the answer is yes hes coopted the imperial house he took the sheet and returned it to his briefcase id bet you anything noda himself wrote that speech hes begun tamara his total takeover of america and japan she sat a moment in silence a strange sensation in her stomach did she believe it she wasnt sure ken theres something you should know a colleague came with me on this trip an american lawyer knowing him hes probably still down in the bar id like him to read this why dont we go down and ill introduce you who is he can he be trusted as a matter of fact hes an old friend from a long time past but weve been through a lot together lately he leaned back and sipped his beer am i to assume this traveling companion is more than a casual friend thats not exactly your worry is it i dont pry into your life when im away she got up to retrieve another can of beer you cant blame me for being curious tam its a simple reasonable question nothing kenji asano does is ever simple she told herself theres always a subtext dont try to change the subject one thing at a time she sipped from her glass and regarding your plan as far as im concerned theres been too much miti dabbling already frankly it pisses me off im sorry if you choose to feel that way tam his eyes darkened please believe me when i assure you were on the same side ive told you what i propose doing about noda but i havent heard any of your ideas she sighed and sipped her beer i dont have any yet then why not trust me trust there was that word again trouble was she wasnt sure she trusted anybody anymore she rose strolled to the window and reached for the curtain should she let him stay the night maybe that was just asking for more heartaches letting japan screw america two ways with that dismal thought she pulled open the curtains it had begun to snow a swirl of drifting white ken come and take a look she beckoned him i think id like to go outside for a while im weary to death of arguing he rose and came over to the window standing next to her its just started he glanced around the room did you bring any boots no and i dont care i just want some fresh air to help clear my head all right but well have to use the service elevator i cant be seen walking through the lobby not till tomorrow we can take the stairs come on by the time they emerged onto the driveway leading out toward the road traffic had slowed to a crawl and the futuristic shapes of tsukubas labs seemed like a fairyland she noticed that the hotel had its own helicopter pad undoubtedly to accommodate miti officials who needed to pop up for a quick consultation the place was hightech powerful frightening just like kenji asano ken im afraid maybe weve lost it you and me lost what whatever we had there in kyoto she sighed maybe youve lost it tamara they were striding through the first thin film of white that now blanketed the sidewalk paralleling the road leaving a trail of flattened footprints nothing has changed for me youre welcome to come back and be part of my life anytime you choose well right now i just want to walk in the snow she glanced at him wondering if she still felt anything at all you know its a funny thing but the snow tonight reminds me of a trip i once took years ago up north to hokkaido the innocence the simplicity it was all captured in that pure endless white she looked around them how could tsukuba science city even be part of the same country he smiled as the tour books always say japan land of contrasts well the old ways are going fast tam except in our hearts some things will always be the same tell you the truth thats what scares me the most things like the sword which can cause this whole country to go crazy overnight ah yes the sword matsuo nodas magic talisman you know thats the real reason hell be so hard to stop what a genius he delivers it to the emperor almost the same way the sun goddess supposedly once did and in the process makes himself a living god speaking of the sword by the way matt is going over to the metallurgy lab tomorrow to see it live and prime time matt the lawyer i told you about so his name is matt short for matthew walton but why well besides being a corporate attorney hes supposed to be an amateur expert on swords hobby of his and noda is actually letting him see it there was a faint note of surprise in his voice very unusual that sword has been kept very tightly under wraps or so ive heard believe it tomorrow matt walton gets a command presentation courtesy of noda hes arranged everything with the imperial household she gazed up at the sky now a white marble reflecting back the lights from the traffic tam id like very much to see it too think you could arrange something with nodasan i can try you know not many people outside the imperial household have actually viewed it really up close i hear its almost perfectly preserved then this could be your chance she reached and took his hand after all the weather was cold ill ring noda in the morning thanks but no matter what happens with that or anything else just seeing you again will make this trip worthwhile he gave her hand a squeeze all right ken dammit you win she turned and slipped her arms around his neck then drew his lips down to hers the snow drifted onto her eyelids youre right i dont have any answers to anything again she felt almost as though time was running in reverse the smoothness of his skin the ease of his touch the firm muscles itll be over soon tam it has to be and then well all look back on this like a bad dream he encircled her in his arms well go off to hokkaido if you like it so much there together just you and me why is it all the men i know keep offering me trips she laughed and brushed the snow out of his hair matt keeps trying to get me to go down to the caribbean now you want to take me to hokkaido i sound like everybodys getaway girl nobodys called you a girl youre a woman you decide what you want well at the moment i just want to go to bed with you she pulled his lips down after that ill worry about the next move we just have to trust each other thats all that matters well she thought how could she not trust this man at least for tonight tomorrow she would think about tomorrow chapter twentythree kenji asano was a very complex human beingwestern on the surface but with his own personality always glimmering through at the unexpected moment he seemed to capture the best of both worlds the forthrightness of an american and the intuitive selfconfidence ive come to think of as a hallmark of the east the japanese are a subtle people in the finest sense of the word and i normally feel slightly oafish in their land i always know im missing about three levels of the nuance in whatevers going on by the same token a japanese venturing into the west frequently seems to be moving as though he were following the numbers on one of those old arthur murray dance diagrams the steps are precise and correct but theres no glide to it no natural rhythm ken i must say had long since gotten past that kind of awkwardness his motions were fluid his reactions quick and natural also he managed to achieve this while retaining qualities that always reminded you he came from a culture that was writing kyoto romances and wearing perfumed silk when london and paris still had pigs in their garbagestrewn streets ken youre a phenomenon we were climbing into his blue toyota sports car which hed driven up from tokyo low profilethe car and the trip this play could blow up in your face over our leisurely threeway breakfast in the hotel bar he had given me a reasonably detailed sketch of the situation after which tam headed off in the dni limo for her second day of appointments in the robot labs my honest reaction despite the prickle of jealousy was instant liking of asano furthermore in the absence of anything better his scheme seemed worth a shot now came the sword a phone call established that noda had no objection to kens seeing it too so we were set to head over to the metallurgy lab together not a bad time for straight talk i know its a gamble matthew but id like to think of it as repaying my debt to america he inserted his key in the ignition and started the engine in a way i feel some personal responsibility for the current condition of your technology was he about to come clean on the subject of mitis semiconductor blitz you know i once heard you were the brains behind japans memory chip takeover our strategy seemed prudent at the time he sighed then turned around to begin backing out of the hotel parking lot if youre planning for the long term the sectors you focus on are obvious he paused to light a peace then crumpled the wooden match in his hand and exhaled as he shifted into drive and you play hardball otherwise why bother i guess we had no idea the us could be so inept we assumed your semiconductor people like your baseball teams were major league he was right about that part america fumbled away its lead by chasing quick profits while miti was playing the only way it knew how long term i cant tell you how much i regret whats happened since he continued glancing occasionally at the rows of research labs gliding by on both sides of the roadway i now realize that a more cooperative approach would have worked to everyones benefit in the long run we each need the other now its going to take plenty of cooperation to prevent the us from becoming a back office for matsuo noda you really think a big miti move will blow the whistle matthew the ministry is the closest thing japan has to a strategic deterrent by exploiting it i will become the japanese rosenberg in the eyes of many but if i can cause a worldwide scandal perhaps everyone here and in the us will start thinking about the implications of nodas takeover friend youre throwing your career in front of a train i said it with respect matsuo noda could eat us both for hors doeuvres us maybe but not miti at least not yet he smiled you know we japanese have a tradition of committing ritual suicide seppuku to emphasize a principle you might say im doing that but its only professional seppuku no unseemly knives or blood on the tatami i understand now why tam feels about you the way she does matthew he spoke quietly i am here you are there i think she needs someone she trusts and you seem to be that person just now stay by her id like nothing better and with that we lapsed into pensive silence it took only about ten minutes for the drive over to the laboratory another structure that could have been a hangar for flying saucers somehow the idea of viewing a sacred relic of japans imperial past in this scifi setting was incongruous in the extreme pure george lucas we alighted in the executive parking lot and headed up the sidewalk together at the sealed entrance ken showed his palm to the computers eye a synthetic voice cleared us and in we went waiting on the other side was a senior staff man who greeted us at the first security check bowed and motioned us to follow one area of the lab had been cordoned off top security with guncarrying guards posted about every ten feet there were also about two dozen plainclothes types wearing a white armband emblazoned with the imperial insignia seemed that nobody but nobody got close to the sun goddesss sidearm without clearance from the top the staff man said noda was currently tied up in a meeting with the director so we should wait no need i said flashing my dni meishi he bowed and we were waved past the guards then ushered directly into the topsecurity workroomwhere the team of whitefrocked technicians was said to be cleaning and retouching the gilding on the swords tsuba hand guard the decorative little disc that separates the hilt from the blade since the tsuba on swords were interchangeable not necessarily connected in any particular way to a given piece theyre actually a separate art form interesting but not overly serious items fact is the imperial household could just as well have sent this one up here for work and kept the sword in tokyo such however was not the case the main attraction itself was undoubtedly over there on the back workbench in a big stainless steel box half the size of a coffin an armed guard stationed next to it noda must have told everybody we were coming in today because the technicians parted like the red sea at our approach although the president of dai nippon was still nowhere to be seen the tsuba was there all right lying exposed on a worktable right next to a pile of cleaning pads and the gilding apparatus and it was a stunner take my word one of the most tasteful ive ever had the pleasure to view iron of course and about ten centimeters across circular actually it was shaped like a chrysanthemum with the raised image of a mirror on one side and a beaded necklace on the other the exquisite metalwork was enhanced by the fresh gilding which made the embossing even more striking my unprofessional opinion very very ancient older than twelfth century entirely possible i really couldnt say but a wild guess would be early heian certainly no later than kamakura fact is back in those days metalwork didnt change all that much for long periods of time so theres no real way to date with precision hijoni omoshiroi desuvery interestingi said after a respectful interval hoping to get into the spirit of the occasion and impress everybody with my berlitz japanese and now would it be possible to see the actual sword i pointed toward the stainless steel coffin sealed in there i presume the head technician bowed and suddenly looked very troubled then he mumbled something in rapid japanese to asano he didnt budge problem i turned to ken he says matsuo noda has given strict orders that the sword is never to be viewed by the public when disassembled he shrugged nodasama he says has declared it to be sacred and therefore it must be displayed with the proper ceremonial reverence always of course well still be able to see it but only after the tsuba is replaced perhaps later on this afternoon wed come all this way and now we were going to be stymied by some middlemanagement lab technician of coursei bowed back hoping to bluffwerent you informed why we are here i have the honor to be matsuo nodas senior american corporate counsel nodasama has ordered me to check and make certain the hilt remains in place while the tsuba is undergoing repair so if youll kindly open the case ill verify that and the matter will be ended i bowed again so desu he turned pale obviously the grip had been removed whoops id just bungled creating a problem worse than the one i wanted to circumvent on the other hand i continued quickly trying to recoup as long as its locked in the case im sure therell be no problem again he bowed looking relieved noda had these guys scared however it will be necessary to actually see the sword so i can report to nodasama that i have carried out his instructions otherwise nodasama may be upset and i will be deeply dishonored couching the ploy in personal terms seemed to tip the scale he bowed again hesitantly then led us over to the box throughout my little white lie ken hadnt said one word guess he was as curious as i was to take a look do you realize what you are about to witness the senior staff man stood before us his dark eyes haughty and grave time to put the barbarian gaijin in his place physical proof of the divinity of his imperial highness the emperor of japan this sword is the most sacred object in the world i nodded reverently and moved to the side to let the head technician begin he slipped a magnetic card into the handle of the steel case punched in some electronic numbers on a pad there next to the latch and slowly raised the lid since photographs of the sword had been officially forbidden by the imperial household id not seen even so much as a snapshot ken and i were literally holding our breath the interior of the coffin had been partitioned into a front and rear section both draped with satin first he lifted away the back shroudto reveal a long gold box that i figured must be the watertight case nodas scientists had originally detected ken emitted a low hum as we looked at it gleaming the purest of the pure it had to be karat like something youd find in the tomb of a pharaoh along the sides were some elegant playful heianstyle reliefs birds musical instruments shinto goddesses breathtaking thats the only word i can find its beautiful i was staring dazzled and the sword the technician hesitated guess we still had him worried im sure nodasama will be pleased to know of your cooperation i said soothingly there should be no difficulty he got the message we werent going to rock the boat wa harmony he nodded again reassured then reached down and lifted away the satin cloth covering the front section underneath was a bolster of deep purple velvet and nestled in the middle was the imperial sword ken emitted a quiet reverent exclamation the hissed japanese saaaa that denotes pensive regard and for a second we both just stood there dr kenji asano was clearly awestruck i was too as well we should have been for one thing it was a superbly wellpreserved piece the blade was delicately curved and its edge could probably still do damage a few flecks of rust were visible here and there but overall it was in mint condition just as noda had claimed even more interesting was that sure enough the grip had been removed while they worked on the tsuba so we were being treated to a glimpse of the sacred sword the way noda had specified it should never be viewedexcept by a few crewcut technicians there in the labwith the nakago the steel beneath the grip exposed we were seeing it all its gratifying to report that his publicity people had told the truth there was indeed no signature on the nakago i guess if youre swordsmith for god you just naturally go easy on the ego that omission notwithstanding it was definitely a firstclass katana looked to be some kind of offalloy heavy on copper if you had to guess what the early swords were like say at a time in between the latebronze and earlyiron ages this would be a knowledgeable estimate for appearance the alloy was plausible it was clearly very old and with an antique hilt such as the one lying there the overall look was very reasonable i was impressed put the handle back on the way you normally see a sword and everything about it clicked sorry but out of habit i have to do something now what follows is a technical description of the imperial sword including the part usually hidden by the gripwhich nobody else has been able to supply because nobody else had seen it disassembled as it was there in the lab there may be some collectors whod feel cheated by anything less this was as the senior staff man had sternly brought to our attention a onceinalifetime moment early shinto katana very long and active sunagashi and utsuri extending into a kaen boshi slender nakago with one mekugiana shallow koshizori with chukissaki and bohi along either shinogi extending into the nakago enough actually that last part made me a little sad truthfully i think noda was absolutely right nobody should sully the divinity of this piece by exhibiting it disassembled with the grip removed the problem is that anybody with the slightest experience might possibly have his faith shaken a trifle since its common knowledge that a tapered nakago the sloping edge there extending back into the section normally covered by the hilt didnt come into its own till around the mid fif mr walton i hadnt expected you until later you should have contacted me it was the voice of matsuo noda directly behind me i looked up to notice that the faces of all the technicians around the room now matched their bleached lab coats guess we need to coordinate better i turned around and smiled walton i lectured myself dont be a smartass just this once be reverent who the hell knows how the sun goddess liked her nakagos tapered besides the simple truth was the imperial sword of emperor antoku really knocked me over superb workmanship excellent balance elegant shape and overall surprisingly good condition well except for one thing its almost perfect i revolved back to examine it except for that little scratch on the nakago too bad what scratch mr walton he stared down its actually on the other side as best i recall there followed a long pause as nodas eyes gradually narrowed to slits finally he said i wasnt aware you were so conversant with press descriptions of the sword mr walton we both knew the scratch on the nakago on the side not showing had never once been mentioned in the papers which was as it should be a minor blemish really all the same i now felt very guilty about it i do hope it was an unavoidable accident like the metallurgy guys at the princeton lab claimed in the apology that accompanied their bill after i shipped it down last summer for tests this was turning out to be quite a day seems new yorks crime statistics were looking up a theft had actually been solved the son of a bitch was mine ah well mr walton i trust you are suitably impressed all the same only you could appreciate how much my head was swimming judging from the surrounding technicians reverent gaze i got the definite impression they had totally missed the significance of our exchange kenji asano was now wearing a pure poker face what was he thinking my own concentration however was elsewhere at that particular instant the new realization matthew walton is a dead man as of this moment noda would never let me live to tell what i knew just then an official wearing some sort of formallooking black kimono emblazoned with the kiku crest of the imperial household agency came walking briskly out of the office behind us he was carrying a silver case about cigarbox size something etched across its filigreed lid he walked over to noda bowed deferentially and settled it on the workbench next to kenji asanos briefcase nobody paid him much notice however since we were all still admiring the sacred sword finally my brain started to function dates right the night i met noda which got me out of the house his hirelings cleaned out my office that was about what two weeks before the sword was discovered perfect just enough time to salt the thing in the inland sea let his hightech research team fish it up the technician bowed to us once more then started spreading the satin cloths back over the two compartments down came the stainless steel lid click history time was over that was when finally ken looked over and noticed the silver case he stared at it puzzled then glanced at noda for whom it obviously was intended and inquired politely concerning what it might be noda cleared his throat mumbled something about official dni business and started thanking the household rep whod brought out the case however the household man showed his breeding he picked up kens question smiled and bowed then proceeded to explain that it contained the only copies of dnis original technical analyses of the swordxray crystallography scans nondestructive radiation tests various scientific data he didnt actually understand but which had been used by dai nippon to establish the swords alloy composition and therefore its sacred authenticity these data had been forwarded to the imperial household with instructions they be kept under lock and key hed understood all along that they had merely been on temporary loan to the emperor and thus he had no objection now that the honorable nodasama had requested their return for additional study by dni scientists all of japan was in the debt of the esteemed matsuo kenji asano turned to stare at me his eyes gradually filling with an enormous realization you know i used to have a hobby of reading biographies of the geniuses whod come up with the truly original insights of modern times how i puzzled did they manage it i mean did newton really watch an apple fall and intuitively sense it was responding to some invisible force maybe or how about einsteins insight that matter and energy are really the same thing or that space can be curved whatever happened they made a connection that nobody else in history had ever come up with who can explain how these breakthroughs happen theyre always the result of standing off and viewing reality in a wholly new way with apologies ive invoked some heavy names but the point is there are transcendental moments when a given set of circumstances is suddenly seen to fit more than one paradigm of how the universe functions standing there looking at the silver case kenji asano saw the apple fall from the tree and i was only seconds behind him new insight number one something very fishy was going on with the imperial sword something which would not necessarily stand the light of day on that one i was actually several seconds ahead number two if the truth came out japan would be a laughingstock worldwide worse his imperial majesty would have egg all over his imperial face as would matsuo noda hence the box having served its pr purpose had to go number three the first two insights pointed to the very real possibility that matsuo noda had long since passed around the bend sanitywise but whether he had or not one thing was clearthat silver case contained everything we needed to nail dai nippon who knew for sure what was in it but ken and i both realized at that instant the contents had to be pure dynamite what happened next i probably wouldnt have believed if i hadnt been standing there to witness it with my very own eyes kenji asano was calmly extracting a peace cigarette from the packet in his left breast pocket and inserting it in his mouth then his right hand came up and out of his thumbnail flared one of those wooden matches he liked so much asanosan sumimasen the senior staff man stepped forward and blurted out no smoking please sorry replied asano and he flicked the still burning match toward the waste bin there at the end of the table which just happened to be piled high with the solvent pads theyd been using to scour the tsuba a lab can be a dangerous place and this one was no exception a microsecond thereafter the floor was carpeted in flame later i theorized what must have occurred remembering a longago personal disaster that almost got me kicked out of college the heavy aromatic solvent they were using probably a benzene compound had vaporized off the cleaning pads drifted down over the sides of the container and was hovering as an invisible heavierthanair cloud just above the floor at knee level the exact same thing happened to me once in a chem labduring an afterhours endeavor wherein i was steaming out a twentygallon benzene container preparatory to an experiment on the propensity of brewers yeast to convert grape sugar into potable ethanol the sink happened to be situated next to a gasfired hotwater heaterwhich suddenly kicked on next thing i knew the heavy fumes around my ankles detonated along with the lab fire alarm that explosion as this one was actually minor mostly noise though it sounded like a bomb the fumes flashed and it was over leaving no damage other than to the nervous system of any bystanders this time however there was an added ingredient the waste container it had become an instant inferno billowing dark toxic smoke into the room as yelling lab technicians began rushing in with fire extinguishers everybody else was bolting for the exits including the security people all in all it seemed a reasonably propitious moment to make our own departure as well since wed been the cause of the ruckus ken fumbled around in the smoke now obscuring the workbench till he recovered his briefcase and then we headed out at the door i caught sight of the household official and bowed my thanks domo arigato gozaimashita i am deeply honored by this opportunity to view the imperial sword of emperor antoku i bowed again he nodded back and glared at asano id planned to thank noda too but he was still in there with the confusion undoubtedly standing personal guard over his sacred sword let him stay there was no real danger the fire should be out in no time it was mainly smoke anyway ken was also bowing his farewells to one and all then as though on cue we both started edging toward the main hallway by now security people were running down the corridors and the place was in pandemonium when we reached the lobby i almost wanted to bolt for the outer door but we managed to keep our exit dignified businesslike finally as we cleared the last security checkpoint i turned to him you really should be more careful with your smokes ken i lowered my voice manage to grab it in my briefcase then lets get the hell out of here nodas going to figure out what happened any second now and go totally bananas i doubt he will be pleased tell you one thing that silver case has got to disappear fast or were likely to vanish ourselves we may anyway i quickened my pace toward the parking lot you know ive got a wild hunch whats in that box but whatever it is i do know for sure wed better get the thing somewhere for safekeeping quick should we tell tamara he glanced down at the smoke smeared briefcase in his hands as though holding a cobra shes got to know everything for her own safety matthew he said looking at me youre supposed to be an authority so tell me the truth you were behaving strangely in there its a fake isnt it ken during the middle ages about fifty different monasteries in europe possessed the authentic consecrated relic of christs circumcision whos to say remember francis bacons what is truth japans emperor is now and forever thats the only truth that matters what are you saying that sword belongs to the people of japan ask them if its real well youve learned enough about this country to be able to get your message across without actually spelling it out very japanese he stared at me youll have to concede one thing though matsuo noda is an absolute genius think about it he claimed to have analyzed the sword then donated the data to the imperial householdknowing there would be only one place on earth where it could be right out in public and yet never actually examined in a fancy silver case kept by a bunch of household bureaucrats not one of whom would have the presumption to open it or be able to understand anything if he did my own nagging thoughts at that moment were on a different track why had noda offered to let me see my own piece to flaunt the dimensions of his balls or was he starting to believe his own trumpedup fantasy had matsuo noda convinced himself he was god that he could turn water into wine or a fifteenthcentury metallurgical screwup into the more i thought about it the scarier it got or maybe just maybe he thought i wouldnt recognize it with a different hilt could be he was right but ken and i had accidentally viewed it disassembled that wasnt part of his little inside joke for once matsuo noda had blown it ken everything ive learned about noda so far tells me hes going to do something totally unexpected the minute he realizes we took that let him i want to know whats in it do the world a favor no never never open it he paused a second and looked down at his briefcase maybe youre right its better for everybody if it just disappears by then wed fully cleared the outer doors the day was turning gorgeous sunny and brisk the thin film of last nights snow was all but gone abruptly he stopped wait matthew think a minute we have to at least make a copy of the contents and it needs to be gotten out of japan to protect ourselves precisely okay ill buy that got any ideas well first lets go pick up tam then id like to transmit digital facsimiles of whatevers in here to new york she can set up a file in dnis big nec mainframe and only the three of us will know the file name itll be your and her insurance policy can we do that from here in fifteen minutes theres the teleconferencing center over next to electrotechnical theyve got everything well need then lets collect her and get it done fast he opened the door of the toyota then turned to me you know matthew i think you and tam ought to be gone from here too as soon as possible theres a copter pad by the hotel im going to phone for a miti chopper to pick you up and take you straight to narita he patted his briefcase after weve transmitted the contents of this i want you back in new york ill call my secretary and have her book the next flight out well just have somebody bumped if its full why dont you come with us no need for you to face noda alone not yet he hit the ignition but ill be there in spirit how prophetic chapter twentyfour our major concern at that point was time we had a lot to do and we werent sure how long we had to do it furthermore it would be foolhardy to assume everything was going to proceed smoothly that apprehension was in fact soon to be thoroughly vindicated first it wasnt all that simple to track down tam we finally discovered shed already left the robotics lab and was back at the tsukuba hotel lunching with matsugami and some of his senior staff returning there however did provide a perfect opportunity to grab our bags ken dragged her from the lunch with a phony excuse and minutes later we were checked out solving at least one logistics problem unfortunately it also tipped off matsugami and anybody else who might be interested that we were departing next were the details of arranging for the chopper while we were driving around trying to locate tamara ken was busy on his car phone pulling strings to commandeer one of the two miti helicopters after three calls he managed to locate one at their auxiliary pad currently being refueled and serviced i listened to him lean on the service people doing his diplomatic but firm deputy minister routine end of long story it would be on its way shortly arriving in about an hour and a half good we thought plenty of time to handle the transmission of the stillunseen documents in nodas silver case in the car we brought tam fully up to date on the extraordinary circumstances by which it had fallen into our possession including its potential for use as leverage against noda then we headed for the teleconferencing center where we planned to open the thing scan the contents with a reader and bounce the pages to new york via satellite ken revealed the ministry had a highsecurity channel it used to communicate with the new york offices of jetro the japan external trade organization over on sixth avenue mitis public relations arm he declared we would just link up with that office and have them patch us through to the dni computer nothing to it which was correct theoretically when we marched in ken again flaunting his deputy minister walkon priority the whiteshirted staff bowed to the floor led us to the hardcopy scanner turned it on and diplomatically excused themselves closing the security door the place was ours dont know why but until that moment none of us had really wanted to know what was in nodas case maybe a part of me still didnt even then whatever the reason however none of us had bothered to take it out of kens briefcase for examination turned out that was a mistake he settled his satchel onto the desk clicked it open and out came the box for our first real look as he wiped off the smoke my initial reaction was to be dazzled it was magnificent a silversmiths masterpiece engraved with all manner of mythological beast and fowl a work of art in every sense never seen anything remotely like it the problem was it wasnt merely locked it was soldered shut the silver lid had literally been welded on leaving it essentially a solid piece noda it turned out left nothing to chance only a silversmith could crack the seal and divulge the contents so we still had no idea what was inside and worse wed managed to fritter away a valuable half hour coming to that fruitless discovery now what shit said tam when will we ever get a break looks like weve got two choices ken announced ruefully gazing down at the intractable chunk of metal in his hands we can do what we probably should have done in the first place simply stash this for the moment and let noda think we know whats in it or we can drive into tokyo and locate somebody there who can open it then transmit from miti headquarters downtown neither of these plans seemed particularly inspired the first gave us nothing but presumptions for leverage and the second could take hours noda we all realized was not a man who dallied actuallytam spoke uptheres a third option surely nodas going to find out sooner or later we came here to the center believe me he always learns everything eventually so why not transmit something else now anything and then after you get the case open you can send the real data you mean give him circumstantial cause to assume weve got the goods on him sounded good to me buying ourselves more time right itll take him awhile to find out exactly what was transmitted all hell know for certain is that we sent something in the meantime ken can go on to tokyo and proceed with plan b open the case there and transmit the real contents he looked skeptical that might deceive everybody for a while but not for long therere too many links in the chain between here and dnis new york office but sending something now will gain time it has to then you can go on to tokyo and do what you need to from there tomorrow maybe he still wasnt totally convinced but all rightrather than waste time arguing lets just go ahead and do it no harm in any instance she peeked into his briefcase a jumble of documents what have you got in here that we could send todays asahi shimbun he laughed ken okay okay he laid the newspaper aside and was riffling through his paperwork how about a few miti memos nothing to do with marketshare i hope said tam promise the apparatus was already humming so he put through the connection to jetros new york office whereupon tam took over and gave them instructions for the phone link over to the dni mainframe it probably required all of a couple of minutes welcome to the brave new world of global information technology since we were just shooting in the dark they transmitted some twenty or twentyfive pages actually it would have been almost better to send too few rather than too many at four pages a minute though we were finished in no time as something of a joke tam suggested using the file name nipponica homage to nodas takeover pipe dream somehow it seemed poetic justice whether the transparency of our ruse would be immediately evident to matsuo noda remained a big unknown but maybe noda would have no real way of discovering wed sent garbage at least not for a while the transmission done we signed off zipped up kens briefcase and marched out as if we knew what we were doing still it was only a bluff and a shaky one at that which set me to thinking ken it seems to me yours is the critical path in this play now we were walking back to the executive parking lot where wed left his car its more important to have a real copy of the data stashed somewhere than it is for us to blow the country in the next two hours which means maybe you ought to take the chopper back yourself send the stuff today and let us just drive down to narita in your car i agree tam nodded concurrence we can leave it there and you could have somebody pick it up tomorrow thats dangerous for both of you maybe so she said but hes going to come after this case guns blazing as his first priority ken youre the one whos going to have to stay out of his way now not us the quicker you move the better youve got a point all right if you want me to then i could take the copter back to tokyo myself and you can use the toyota he was fishing for his keys in fact maybe you should just leave now let me check the schedule id asked his secretary for a listing of the afternoon and evening flights in case we got delayed it was now onethirty the next flight that looked like a sure thing was a united at seven fortytwo or maybe the jal at nine then there was a northwest at tenfifteen loads of time look we can wait for the chopper and at least see you off why dont we head back over to the hotel and have a drink solemnize the occasionthe final nailing of matsuo noda fine he started the car but both of you get only one at least whoevers driving does i want you back in one piece the hotel bar was beginning to feel like a second home though now it was deserted the lunch trade long departed our ceremonial libation also provided my first real opportunity to study ken asano at leisure i sat sipping my suntory while he repeated once again the details of his upcoming political move at miti given any kind of luck the flap would render nodas takeover a worldwide scandal good tam and i had been nodas point men had done everything we knew to assist him and now it was clear hed been using us all along for his own ends he was bent on bringing american industry back to life for the sole purpose of skimming the cream what other reason could there be nodas noble intention supposedly was to help rejuvenate those american corporations doing basic researchbut the price was then to let japan lift that r ampd and translate it into consumer technology thereby keeping for his team all the elements of real economic value in the chain from laboratory to cash register they would be the ones refining their strategic capacity to transform new ideas into worldclass products and economic leadership japan would retain the advanced engineering segment of product development while tossing a few lowskill assembly plants to the us to make us think we were still part of the action it would of course be a fatal delusion the hightech hardware of tomorrows world increasingly would be japanese while america became an economy of papershuffling mbas and lowpaid grease monkeys assembling products we no longer were able to design or engineer that depressing conclusion required the space of one scotch by then i was ready to order a second hoping it would bring forth a solution to the problem the first had evoked with such alarming clarity but there wasnt time at that moment we heard the miti copter settling onto the pad next to the hotel parking lot ken heres to success i saluted him with the last melting ice cubes he toasted back then signaled for the bill time to get moving the chopper was a new aerospatiale as n twin dauphin big and white a vip fourseater single pilot capable of the japanese love those highrotor french copters guess ken had called in a lot of chips to arrange this customized threewheeler for a couple of gaijin the seatmile costs alone must have been staggering but there it was fully serviced and set to go he walked over ducking the rotor and advised the pilot that there had been a slight change of plans theyd be returning directly back to tokyo the man wearing a blue uniform bowed and gave him a little salute they seemed to be old friends well i thought if deputy ministers dont use this goldplated extravagance then whos it for then he returned to pick up his briefcase nodas silver box safely therein have a brief farewell and give us his keys tamara telex me the minute you get back well proceed immediately full speed lets go for it she smiled and drew his face down for a long languorous kiss i then shook his hand and we headed for the car since our bags were just little carryons we looked solid to catch the united flight with a couple of hours to spare assuming traffic cooperated tam how about taking the wheel this lefthandsideof theroad driving takes practice i almost hit somebody once in england sure she reached for the keys then turned back to wave to ken but he was already climbing aboard and didnt notice isnt it odd i mused we still havent heard zip out of noda he must have realized by now we have his silver case whats he planning to do wherell he try to head us off good question she turned the key in the ignition im not going to feel safe till weve got the actual goods on his phony sword not just some dummy data my guess is hell try and nail us at the airport itd be his best shot at least ken was smart enough to make the reservations under fake names so he wont know which flight to watch therere not that many he could be covering them all on the other hand hell assume were arriving via the miti chopper so maybe we can dodge his hit squad i feel like ive been run through a wringer she was pulling out of the slot backing around to begin making her way through the rows of staff vehicles all with special tsukuba parking stickers you can say that again who could have guessed all the id reached around to check the back window hoping to get the heat going when my field of vision turned an incandescent orange bright and glaring as though the sun had just come in for a close encounter before i could turn to see what the dashboard rose up and slugged me in the teeth as a shock wave flung us both against the seat belts were dead i thought weve been bombed nodas just dropped then i looked up the miti aerospatiale about two hundred feet off the ground had become a blazing sphere a grotesque nova now its rotor blades were clawing the air askew while it circled downward like a wounded bird an instant later it nosed into the parking lot behind us hurtling fragments of tail assembly through several empty staff cars i sat mesmerized as a second ball of fire erupted where it had crashed one of the fuel tanks had ignited just like in the movies ken tam let out a choked cry after the first few seconds of disbelief then she slammed the transmission into park and began ripping off her seat belt wheres she going doesnt she realize her door was open and she was stumbling out thats when i finally came to my senses which included the sobering thought that there might be more fuel tanks such as the auxiliary that hadnt yet blown wait id ripped off my own seat harness by that time and had rolled out to begin running after her as she stumbled across the snowy stretch of asphalt separating us from the flames she was moving like a gazelle but i managed to catch up about thirty yards from the wreckage using a modified shoulder block i pulled her around and tried to get a grip tam nobody could survive that weve got to stay back at which point we both slipped and collapsed in a patch of snow just as the last fuel tank detonated with the impact of a sonic boom memory can be a little unreliable under such circumstances but i still remember more wreckage sailing past us including a strut off the landing gear that gouged a furrow in the asphalt no more than ten feet from our heads tam he never knew what hit him it had to be instantaneous i was trying to brush the wet snow off her face as i slipped my arm around her shoulders she was still holding back the tears but only just we didnt even have a real goodbye her words were jagged there were so many things i was hoping we her voice trailed off into tears look i only knew him for a day but that was enough to learn some things kenji asano was a wise and noble soul everything about him was good she took my hand and held it against her cheek matt he was so kind that was what he was all that i her eyes were reflecting back the flames now billowing into the pale afternoon sky around us the labs were emptying as technicians raced toward the lot white coats fluttering you know he said something to me today about you what she glanced up her face streaked what did he say he must have known there was danger he sort of asked me to look out for you danger she looked back at the wreckage and a new tear trailed down her left cheek i guess we dont really know for sure do we maybe it was just a fuel tank rupture or you dont believe that no the tears abruptly were gone matsuo noda just took away the one matt im going to kill him it was a sentiment i shared in buckets the question was merely how medieval torture seemed too kind i started to say something inane and then finally the shocking truth landed with the force of that last explosion tam that was supposed to be us i was gazing at the flames watching talons of metal contort in the heat noda thought we were going to be on that copter my god of course weve got to get out of here now theres nothing anybody can do for ken im not leaving till ive settled the score be reasonable theres no way we can do it here this is nodas turf i was urging her to her feet well find a way all i ask is that he know we were the ones who did him in but how can we just leave what else are we supposed to do theres nothing left i tried to take her hand come on she finally relented and with one last tearful stare turned to follow me back to the car by then a crowd of technicians was surging in around us kens blue toyota was still running without a word she buckled in shoved the stick into gear and turned for the exit whereupon she barely avoided colliding with the first racing fire engine look are you okay i can drive if you matt dont say anything more please the tears had vanished can i just think for a while just give me some quiet to think she was gripping the wheel with raw anger please youve got it by the time we reached the highway she was driving mechanically but with absolute precision almost as though tragedy had somehow sharpened her reflexes her logical processes its a curious thing but different people respond differently to disaster and tam was one of those rare few who become harder not softer i could see it in her eyes as the minutes ticked by and we reached the packed thoroughfare that would take us south it even got to be a little unsettling what in hell was going through her head finally after about an hour of bumpertobumper freeways i couldnt take the silence any more without asking anybodys permission i reached over and clicked on the radio it was set for a classical station the music chopin was this kens regular fare i wondered was he a romantic at heart or a classicist guess id never know that or much of anything else about him which thought brought with it a renewed sadness kenji asano was a man of the east who was as much of the west as anybody id ever met in japan id wanted him for a friend when you get to be my age you dont make too many new friends not real ones after forty its acquaintances the roots of true friendship extend so deep that theres never really time to plant them if you start too late maybe its because theres always a part missing that shared experience of being young and crazy and broke those times back when you both still believed anything was possible new friends cant begin sentences with remember that weekend before you were married when we got drunk and getting old is tough and thats one of the toughest parts but somehow i felt with ken that id known him forever could be thats absurd but i really did so quite apart from the tragedy of his death i felt cruelly robbed it sounds selfish maybe but its the truth a sad but true truth i was still thinking those thoughts when the fouroclock newscast came on for a moment neither of us noticed but then tam snapped alert and turned up the volume the report was opening with a live remote from tsukuba science city i couldnt really follow very well but she realized that and began to translate as it went along was the first tragedy of its kind for the ministry and there are widespread calls for an official inquiry dr kenji asano nationally known director of the institute for new generation computer technology died today here at tsukuba science city when a miti helicopter an aerospatiale twin dauphin crashed due to a malfunction no cause has yet been ascertained for the accident which also took the life of the pilot yuri hachiro a miti veteran with fifteen years of service the condition of the wreckage has made it impossible to determine how many other passengers may have been on board although miti sources report that two visiting american scientists are also thought to have been traveling with dr asano their names are being withheld by the ministry at this time pending the completion of a full investigation next came an interview with a miti official after which the reporter offered a wrapup believe dr asanos death represents a significant blow to several vital sectors of mitis computer race with america however the vice minister has assured nhk that mitis research effort will redouble its commitment to tam clicked it off two birds with one stone what matt by bringing down the copter with all three of us in it he was planning to stop miti and us both now he may think he did youre right i looked at her and finally understood the real import of the crash which means were now officially dead if nobody else knows we werent on that chopper why would noda she didnt answer for a long moment finally she said maybe that gives us the time well need time to nail him right ive been thinking about what it all means nodas play not just that im talking about japan everything you know this country could lead the world someday maybe even now if it wanted it has the finest schools the most disciplined people its not hung up on a lot of superpower malemacho bullshit it could be a beacon in the dark a force for good but what has noda done hes turned it all upside down hes exploited the noble things about japan for his own selfish ends greed and power lucifer the fallen angel who walked out on the kingdom i guess so but im also thinking about what he did to me he exploited the fact i was part japanese that i understand the potential this country has he made me think thats what i would be helping him realize but all along he intended to pervert it hes perverted us matthew both of us perverted us and used us and now that were no longer needed hes tried to kill us high time we evened things out damned right i learned a lot when i lived here about the japanese mind and you understand legal tactics swordsmanship i think were ready ready to turn our knowledge against him start probing for the niche in his armor no theres no time for that she was silent for a moment as though preparing her words weve got to just sink him obliterate dai nippon totally and with it matsuo noda you mean go public about the sword the problem with that is exactly everythings destroyed so why not forget about the sword for a while whatever you know about it at this point thats just your word against his i mean we have to bring the whole thing down tam were talking billions of dollars this could take a while that number is a little hard to argue with but what if thats both his strength and his weakness she glanced over at me look ive been thinking about what we might try maybe there is a way to assault him on the money front right but well need your friend bill henderson think hed help i nodded if you want him ill see that he pitches in good she turned her eyes back to the road matt im fujiwara did i ever tell you that and a fujiwaras duty is to protect the emperor of japan for a thousand years its been their job shed cracked begun talking gibberish whats that got to do with noda thinks hes going to exploit the emperor well hes got a big surprise in store i am now going to use dai nippon to destroy him and then drive a stake into dnis heart matthew im going to make matsuo nodas billions just disappear thats impossible watch me chapter twentyfive guess tams shinto kami were on our side since we made it through narita airport with no hassles or maybe being dead keeps you off anybodys hit list now that mlti was determined not to release our names until they located our remains we looked to be in limbo as far as matsuo noda and dai nippon were concerned given the fact the chopper had been demolished and then burned down to metal nobody knew anything yet the scenario tam laid out on the flying back while we drank a lot of airline cognac in the upstairs lounge was destined to be yet another first in the annals of american finance one way or the other if we bungled itand lived to face the consequenceswould we end up like those grimfaced executives you see being hustled into the federal courthouse downtown flanked by gmen in cheap trench coats later eyeing the network cameras wed have to smile bravely and declare that american justice in which we had full confidence would surely vindicate us after all the facts etc to go with her play meant we were headed either for the history books or jail or both but we would definitely need henderson and his georgia mafia my questions were actually pretty simple could it be done and if so how and how fast we got back monday the day before new years and the first person i called after amy was henderson casually mentioning that something potentially very disrupting to the street was in the works bill fasten your seat belt bumpy weather ahead that captured his attention in a flash what in hell he inquired was i talking about we need to get together tonight i continued where how about your place matter of fact theres a real question just now at least in japan concerning whether tam and i are actually alive walton what in gods name is going on in the fullness of time friend all things will be known now we see as through a glass darkly well actually were seeing through the smudgy windows of the plaza suite three twentyfive where were presently holed up but weve got to stay low profile for a few more days whatever you say he replied still puzzled then how about dropping by here tonight for a quick one and then afterward we can all mosey over to mortimers on lex for a quick bite okay as long as we go late i want to miss the happyhour crowd this did not please him but he agreed my suspicions were he wanted to use the occasion to reconnoiter the glittery jetset ladies at the bar henderson whose style and drawl undoubtedly distinguished him from the bschool competition there like a whitemaned palomino in a herd of draft horses investment drones who wore a beeper on their belt and used bottomline as a verb surely found the place a fertile hunting ground mortimers was custommade for his idiosyncratic style about nine that evening tam and i slipped out of the plazas fiftyninth street entrance and headed up fifth avenue toward bills he was headquartered in one of those solid granitefaced buildings near the metropolitan that are constructed like small fortressespresumably so new yorks upper one tenth of one percent can repel the longfeared assault of the homeless hordes at their feet in the lobby henderson vouched for us over the tv intercom after which we were given a visual search by the doorman his uniform a hybrid of gilbert amp sullivan and cryptonazi and shown the elevator a quick doorbell punch and the man from georgia greeted us scotch in hand his little piedaterre was about three thousand square feet of kneedeep carpets old masters i loved the cezanne and the braque and masculine leather furniture a padded wet bar complete with mirror and a bank of computer monitorsfor convenient stock actionstretched across one side of the living room while the sliding glass doors opposite faced onto a balcony that seemed suspended in midair over central park while tam with her designers eye was complimenting him politely on the understated elegance of his italian wallpaper french art and english furniture i tried not to remember all those early years back in new haven when his idea of decor was a feedstore calendar featuring a bluetick hound although the balcony doors were open the living room still had the acrid ambience of a threedayold ashtray he poured us a drink from a halfgallon of glenfiddich on the bar gestured us toward the couch and offered havana cigars from a humidifier i took him up on it out of olfactory selfdefense so tell me ladies and gents whats the latest he settled himself in the leather armchair and plopped his boots onto an antique ottoman howre the jap assault forces doing these days they gonna take over the pentagon next not that weve heard i was twisting my havana against the match though it might reduce procurement costs on toilet seats and ashtrays if they did henderson sipped at his drink then his tone heavied up who are we kidding friends my considered reading of the situation is your boys on third avenue are unstoppable they can do whatever they damn well please from here on out thats not necessarily in everybodys best interest bill i strolled over to look down at the park got any new thoughts cant say as i do our ibm play didnt get to first base noda saw us coming a mile away thank god i didnt get in deep enough to get hurt he leaned back what makes it so damned frustrating is the markets tickled as a pig in shit aint nobody too interested in dissuading your friends from buying up everything in sight streets never seen anything like this kind of bucks before its a whole new ball game downtown thats right bill i mused aloud the question is whose ball game is it tam still hadnt said anything damned good question what happens when foreigners start owning your tangible assets the answer friend is they end up owning you henderson all that could be about to change says who he leaned back looks to me like nodas going all the way bill lets talk one of those hypothetical scenarios you like so much what if dai nippon suddenly had a change of plans switched totally and instead of buying they started selling that pulled him up short he even set down his glass come again call it a hypothetical proposition im asking what would happen on the street if dai nippon decided unannounced to make a significant alteration in its portfolio all of a sudden started divesting massively whend this happen he squinted how much action we looking at i didnt want to say it for fear he might need cpr for his heart finally tam set down her drink and answered him all of it christ he went pale whats that add up to total we figure itd run to several hundred billion i answered he sat there in confusion over what kind of time period thats part of the reason we wanted to see you if strictly as a hypothesis they were to do something like that as fast as possible how long would it take just throw your hat at the number wild guess time you mean exactly well lets look at it a second here id guesstimate that all the exchanges togetherbig board american merc cbot nasdaq pacific the restprobably have a dollar volume upwards of how many billions a day say twenty billion easy maybe more the way volumes climbing but that figures purely hypothetical if dai nippon dumped all those securities on the table at once the value of their portfolio would go to hell i glanced at tam thats how we see it too she said and nothing more what are you two suggesting he was visibly rattled nodad never pull anything that crazy bill with all due respect lets proceed one step at a time here with this hypothesis i went on assuming just for purposes of discussion he did decide to do something like that unload everything whats the fastest way hell id have to think come on man financial derringdo is your special trade i pressed him what if dnis mainframe was used to set up a global trading network began dumping worldwide well thatd probably be the quickest approach he was slowly coming awake jesus christ its not noda were talking about he looked at me then at tam its you youre going to try and possibly then we sure as hell are talking theory cause youd never be able to do anything like that without nodas gettin wind of it henderson as usual youre not listening plausibility is not the topic under discussion right now were looking at the impact well youd damned well better start with some plausibility he settled back say you could get around noda the next problem is the minute word hits the street dnis dumping all hells liable to break loose itd be front page and first thing you know the markets going to be headed the wrong way if youve got a heavy block of shares you want to divest you damn well do it on the qt cause its price can start to nosedive folks tend to figure you know something they dont the streets about ninety percent psychology and ten percent reality if that much just concentrate on the technical part henderson well friends any way you cut it were talking what id call a very dubious proposition those jap institutions would lose their shirt if dni dumped all at once he exhaled quietly you start rolling billions and billions in japanese money how you plan on keeping the thing from blowing skyhigh youd have nips climbing all over your ass in ten minutes flat you tried something like that henderson relax what if we did it anonymously like i said used the dni mainframe funneled orders through accounts everywhere dummy accounts in banks all over the place wouldnt that give us some elbow room maybe maybe if you played it right id guess a few wise guy analysts would probably sniff something in the wind but nobodyd have a handle on the real action at least not for a while things might stay cool temporarily are you saying that in theory the market side is doable at least initially tam pressed him im just guessing its vaguely conceivable he got up to freshen his drink be that as it may though the real problem is the japanese end id guess the shits going to be all over the fan in tokyo the minute you start selling those pension funds are not going to roll over and let you wreck their portfolio billi spoke uptheyre not going to be able to stop us count on it dni holds the stock as trustee nodas rules ironclad power of attorney so so i said very carefully we are going to take over dai nippon what the hell are you talking about we told him the rambo part jeezus he stared at the two of us what youre proposing is a major felony i could get accessory and five years for just listening to this whos going to file charges how about mr matsuo noda for starters bill we just happen to have a little leverage with mr nodasan at the moment the minute he finds out were still alive youd damned well better or you could be looking at a long interlude of pastoral delights up at the danbury country club he was still dumbstruck finally he grinned after parole though you could probably sell your memoirs to newsweek for a couple of million and land a guest slot on carson there was a long pause as silence filled the room broken only by the distant sound of a siren from the street below for a minute i had the paranoid fantasy it was the first wave of the police swat team heading downtown to shoot it out with us finally bill turned back and fixed me with a questioning look are you really serious about this asshole idea its not without appeal walton you dumb fuck do this and youll never work in this town again im well aware of that nobodyd hire you to fight a dog summons let alone a takeover bill turned to tam talk sense to this man it was my idea youre both crazy he walked over to the bar and poured some more scotch into his glass but what the hell ive seen enough to know wed damned sure better start taking this country back into our own hands one way or another so youll help she was watching him like a hawk well now whats life for gentle ladyhe grinnedexcept to kick ass now and again somebodys got to throw a monkey wrench into nodas operation if you think you can do it then count me in if nothing else maybe we can cause a few waves down on the potomac what am i hearing i found myself wondering dr william j henderson capitalisms pillar of sober reappraisal entertaining a scenario straight from a cia handbook of course bill still hadnt heard the second half of the play fine we could use your help on the setup i glanced at the row of crt screens behind the bar first theres the matter of getting control of dnis supercomputer and then well need somebody with trading experience is there any chance you could bring in one of your boys to oversee that end how do you figure on running it id guess our best shot is to stay offexchange as much as possible use jeffries thirdmarket outfits like that and also keep the money offshore international with a lot of separate bank connections to handle the transfers maybe also float some of the interim liquidity in overnight paper to cover our tracks just so we can generally keep the lid on everything as long as we can then it so happens one of my boys might just fill our bill thats his thing he operates freelance now but hes good damned good trouble is he knows it and he dont come cheap anymore i think we can cover a few consulting fees can he keep his mouth shut if he couldnt wed both probably be in jail by now he drained his glass though remember youll be moving a lot of bucks and there are folks who keep track of such things but i know a few smokescreens thatll hold the sec and that crowd at arms length for a little he looked at me for a second his face turning quizzical what was that you said just now about parking the money overnight what are you going to do with it after that youre getting ahead of things tam replied calmly bill why dont we head on over to mortimers i looked out at the park one last time you may need a stiff drink for the rest of this jesus im dealing with maniacs he got up and headed for his coat lets move it chapter twentysix bushido take it apart bushido and you have military knightways the rules of chivalry that governed every moment of a samurais existence this code of honor of the warrior class this noblesse oblige was also known as the way of the sword for a samurai the sword was a sacred icon an emblem of strength and inner resolve casual handling was unheard of you never stepped over a sword you never treated it with insouciance or irreverence it was an extension of your character a samurai regarded his katana as the symbol of his caste a weapon yes but also a constant reminder of who he was his obligations as well as his rights which was why i needed the prize of my collection in hand when we entered our final battle with dai nippon i wanted to face matsuo noda with classic dignity with the japanese honor he had scorned to let him know he had a worthy opponent one who understood the meaning of bushido i also wanted in that process to stick those dni guards uzis up their ass id be needing a katana our meeting with henderson was monday night tuesday morning we all buckled down and began working around the clock each of us handling a separate area tam called in some favors with the head of the nyu computer center and adapted an offtheshelf program for stock transactions to suit our unique requirements she then booked time and scheduled a few debugging runs in the meantime henderson was taking care of our banking preparations opening a string of accounts mostly offshore where we could move with comparative anonymity also we all got together at his place a couple of times and blocked out exactly what we wanted to unload first names and dates while tam and henderson were setting up the financial end the electronics were my responsibility i was on the phone all day tuesday knocking heads with artie wilson an old friend who operated a maritime radio business down on the island of st thomas together we assembled a piece of gear needed to address one of the essential telemetry elements and wednesday night he took his boat over to st croix to install it i think ive already mentioned the marvelous caribbean beach house that had practically fallen into my and joannas hands a few years back it also sported as do a lot of island places a tv satellite dish and it so happens this one was massive a twentyfooter now what is not commonly appreciated is that those concave parabolas can be used to broadcast as well as receive artie and a couple of his cronies worked all wednesday night and got it rigged the way i wanted it including a deadeye bead on the commercial satellite currently being used by dni for proprietary communications with nodas kyoto office i figured it like this if captain midnight could override home box offices satellite network using a receiving station in florida and broadcast a bronx cheer to timelife we could by god knock out dnis highsecurity channel for an hour or so artie would be on standby friday ready to flip the switch noda was apparently still in japan presumably busy throwing obstacles in mitis path or maybe searching for the remains of his silver case let him we were about to start handling his communications with the dni office for him via a setup of our own devising one nice thing about global electronics is that if you get a network farflung enough nobody can trace anythingwhich was what we were counting on after wed killed nodas primary communications system we intended to substitute some japanese hardware wed had installed at hendersonstogether with a little help from a mutual friend in shearson lehmans tokyo office the arrangement was complicated but it looked workable on paper thing was though wed have to get it right the first time no dry runs all of which tended to make me uneasy you dont leave anything to chance when youre playing our kind of game you need to have a backup this feeling brought to mind an admonition in an old sixteenthcentury text on swordsmanship the heiho kaden sho something to the effect that you should surprise your opponent once and then surprise him again so strictly on my own i went about a bit of bushido lawyering using that power of attorney noda gave me back when we started out to set up a fallback position in case tams scheme somehow failed this twist however i decided to keep under wraps nobody needed to be diverted just then worrying about worstcase scenarios thats what corporate counsels are for it was the most hectic week of our lives but by three pm friday we were ready assembled at hendersons place and poised for battle using his new hardware we got on line to shearsons tokyo office bill cashing in a decade of stock tips with a longtime acquaintance we then fed him the miti id codes wed picked up from ken during that illfated episode at the tsukuba teleconferencing center and he used these to patch back through to their new york jetro offices finally we got st croix on the phone holding time to synchronize everybodys watches tam was wearing her usual designer jeans a blue silk shirt and had her dni flight bag freshly packed for the long days ahead that thing says henderson was watching one of his monitors behind the bar now blinking off the seconds then lets all get ready to set at said tam which we did okay time to roll i punched the speakerphone the line to st croix was still open ready artie say the word my man the voice from the box came back we got the watts you on frequency loud and clear sound like they runnin some kind of coded transmission dont read doublecheck artie we cant mess up youre on rf jx right yo my man who doin this he bristled think i cant hit nothing less it got hair round it just nervous up here okay settle down at threethirty exactly twentyseven seconds from now go to transmit no problem stay on channel artie dont wipe out the old ttme gospel hour or something were about to be in enough trouble as it is you the one bout to be up to yo ass in bad news frien me i just some oystershuckin jive nigger dont know shit except i found myself thinking how to make a monkey out of the us coast guard and dea and god knows who else for ten years artie was the best disconcertingly i might also add artie wilson had demanded cash in advance for our job which didnt exactly reflect a high degree of confidence in the endeavor however there was no way we could test what we planned to do this was it youve got fifteen seconds one hand on the switch boss other on my artie stay focused thing is jus hope i remember which one to yank the big one thats what you think white boy zero blast off yooeee they gone pause then yep we pumpin got it just hit that little birdy with enough rf to light up san juan they eatin garbage they decoder up in apple towns gotta be goin apeshit they cant be readin no telex no nothing okay keep it cranking i turned to tam youre on were already patched through on hold all the way through tokyo and back it was still a bit dazzling were going to look just like an auxiliary miti transmission all i have to do is put in the dni code then request the connection over to third avenue she tapped away on hendersons keyboard sending the id through shearsons communications center in tokyo then back through jetro on sixth avenue from whence it was routed into the communications room at dnis third avenue offices since she was using the standard dni transmission format we would look authentic right now with their primary satellite channel gone the jetro link should be dnis only highsecurity connection to the outside world she began the transmission in japanese kana attention eyes only j n tanaka special instructions regarding operations please confirm routine satellite communications channel currently inoperative moments later the message came back confirm communications malfunction then tam due to technical difficulties with transmitter weekend operations terminated staff advise alert number message j that last was dnis special setup that caused the computer to automatically dial the home number for all members of the staff giving special instructions message j told everybody not to come in until further communication god was dni efficient the mainframe just kept dialing each number till somebody picked up it even talked to answering machines we figured that would head off most of the next crew all we needed was a window of a few minutes between the goings and comings then a message came back as tam began translating for us though a strange look was spreading across her face operations already suspended as of ny time per securitylink instructions staff leave of absence is this confirmation repeat is this confirmation what in hell henderson stared at tam then me whose damned instructions matt what do you thinks going on tarns fingers were still poised above the keyboard why on earth would dni kyoto order a shutdown here thats a big question one that had no answer better just fake it and fast what else can we do she revolved back around to the keyboard and began to type confirmation what personnel remain back came tanakas reply as instructed security personnel only tam get off the line this feels wrong she wheeled back again transmission concluded standby for further instruction tanakas reply was brief and to the point a man of few words confirmed whatevers going on weve got to get over there i hit the speakerphone line again artie keep them jammed till five oh five that should do it if were not in by then were dead you got it boss came back the voice any longer some govment honkies gonna put on a trace be our ass correction yo ass just pack up your gear and haul out of there the fccs the least of our problems at the moment you the man down again soon cant rule it out take care i punched off the phone tam was already headed for the door downstairs waited the car and driver wed hired no point trying to hail a cab in rush hour particularly with so much depending on the next thirty minutes okay bill keep that shearson link up maybe itll block anybody else from reaching dnis message center i was putting on my coat wheres that package right here he reached behind the bar and retrieved the one item i wanted with me when we confronted security it was nicely wrapped in brown paper look out for yourself walton i got a few good drinkin years left be a shame to have to do it all by myself your guy ready says hes on his way due here inside fifteen minutes without further farewells we headed for the elevator the trip over brought forth various thoughts on what lay immediately ahead for some reason i found myself remembering yukio mishima who once voiced a very perceptive observation on the nature of swordsmanship he claimed that the perfect stroke must be guided toward a void in space which at that instant your opponents body will enter in other words your enemy takes on the shape of that hollow space you have envisioned assuming a form precisely identical with it how does that happen it occurs only when both the timing and placement of a stroke are exactly perfect when your choice of moment and the fluidity of your movement catch your opponent unawares which means you must have an intuitive sense of his impending action a fraction of a second before it becomes known to your or his rational mind the ability to strike intuitively before your logical processes tell you your opponents vulnerable moment has arrived requires a mystical knowledge unavailable to the left side of the brain because by the time that perfect instant becomes known to your conscious mind it has already passed the point is if you allow yourself to think before you strike you blow it which is why one of the primary precepts of bushido is to strike when it is right to strike not before not after not when you rationally decide the moment has come but when it is right that moment however is impossible to anticipate logically it can only be sensed intuitively my intuition as we rode the elevator up toward dai nippons center of operations was troubled the offices had been cleared in advance of our arrival by somebody from dnis kyoto operation we had struck at the proper void in space all right but our opponent had deliberately created that opening things werent supposed to happen that way then the elevator light showed eleven and the door glided open we were there before us lay the steel doors of the kingdom while tam gave the computer a voice id i stood to the side readying the surprise i planned for nodas security twosome off came the brown paper then the scabbard and in my hand gleamed a twelfthcentury katana from the swordsmith who once served the shogun yoritomo minamoto the prize of my collection it was arguably the most beautiful sharpest hardest piece of steel i had ever seen with the spirit of the shoguns ready she glanced over as the doors slid open now awaiting us just inside the first doors were the xray and metal detector the latter a walkthrough arch like you see in airports then past that were the second doors beyond which were stationed the two uzipacking guards the detector was set to automatically lock the second doors if metal was detected on the persons of those passing through and the wires leading out of it were encased in an aluminum tube attached there on the left this would have to be fast the sword was already up poised and as we entered it flashed out went the electronic box with one clean stroke the encased wires severed at the exact point where they exited from the gray metal there was no alarm not a sound wed iced it beautiful i figured there would be time for exactly two more strokes but they had to be right intuitively perfect so at that moment i shut down my rational mind took a deep breath and gave my life to zen mental autopilot the connecting doors slid open and there stood the guards wed caught them both flatfooted so far so good now the sword yukio mishima whom i mentioned earlier once asserted that opposites brought to their logical extremes eventually come to resemble one another that life is in fact a great circle therefore whenever things appear to diverge they are actually on a path that brings them back togetheran idea of unity captured visually in the image of the snake swallowing its own tail according to him there is a realm wherein the spirit and the flesh the sensual and the rational the yin and yang all join but to achieve this ultimate convergence you must probe the edge take your body and mind to the farthest limits id been reflecting considerably on what this meant to us nodas two heavies personified brute physicality the body triumphant tam and i were meeting them with the power of the mind and i hoped finely honed intuition whereas these may seem the farthest of opposites as with the symbol of the snake they merged at their extremities they became one i knew it and the two startled guys now staring at us understood it as well mind and body were about to intersect the circle had joined their uzisabout two feet long black heavy clip metal stockwere hanging loosely from shoulder straps several inches away from their hands i saw them both reach for the grip but that sight didnt really register my cognitive processes were already shut down while the first mans lefthemisphere neurons were telling his right hand to reach downward the sword was already moving milliseconds ahead it caught the guns heavy leather strap parting it like paper and the uzi dropped just eluding his fingers he stood naked that was all for him and he immediately knew it if youre looking at a razorsharp katana you dont get a fallback try however the second guard dark eyebrows and bald head now had time on his side up came the automatic onehanded right here let me say youve got to admire his pluck if id been staring at a fourfoot katana that could have bisected me like a noodle i might have elected to pass but hed weighed the odds and concluded he had a chance again though his rationality bought us time the neurons firing in his brain were setting in motion a sequence of logic he was thinking the sword wasnt my blank mind was centered on the void the place where the uzi would be when it was leveled at my chest the overhead stroke caught it just where intuition said it would be pointblank his finger a millimeter from the trigger cheap israeli steel the eighthundredyearold katana of yoritomo minamotos swordsmith parted the uzis perforated black barrel like hotel bar butter bifurcated it into identical slices guard number two just grunted as it clattered to the floor by my reckoning wed been in the inner chamber for about three quarters of a second but nodas two human mountains were now standing there holding nothing but time in their hands nobody had to draw them a picture the game was over bushido i motioned tam toward the first guards weapon matthew she hesitated a moment then snapped into action you werent kidding about that sword i never realized lets go right she now had the one remaining automatic the other was no longer usable didnt matter one was all we needed we now had to kill the automatic id on the outer door and put it on manual otherwise the two guards upstairs might come calling while tam stood there with the uzi i went back out and yanked the wires that hooked the voice reader to the computer there was probably a scientific way to turn it off but who had time for science besides just then my veins were still pumping pure adrenaline facing the business end of an uzi even for a fleeting instant is no way to begin an evening tam ordered the guards to open the last door and in we marched tanaka was standing outside his office his dark eyes glazed his bristlecovered skull rosy with shock he turned even redder when he saw the katana nobody had to tell him what it could do mr walton why are you here were about to undertake some corporate restructuring tam proceeded to herd tanaka and the guards into nodas office pausing just long enough to kill the phone wires as he began to recover he commenced sputtering about legal action and jail and general hellfire who cared as of this moment the offices and computer of dai nippon international belonged to us henderson was informed of our progress when his phone rang at exactly pm he arrived along with his georgia mafia computer expert at and tam met them at the security doors i wasnt actually there to welcome them aboard since i was guarding tanaka just then and engaged in a small oneonone with the man explaining to him that matsuo nodas ass was ours the president of dai nippon i advised was a few short days away from becoming everybodys lead story featured as the japanese executive whod apparently rebelled against his homeland noda was no stranger to headlines of course but he preferred to engineer them himself so this definitely wasnt going to be his style matsuo noda was albeit unwillingly about to make history as i broke this news to dai nippons chief of new york operations i sensed he was definitely less than enthusiastic about the prospect well hed have a few days to get used to the idea since nobody was going to enter or leave the eleventh floor for a while it was still a bit difficult to believe what had happened or even more what was next but sometimes reality can have a way of outstripping your wildest powers of imaginationa space shuttle explodes a nuclear meltdown in the ukraine tendollar oil all of it too farfetched to make credible fiction it could only exist in the realm of the real we were about to start moving billions and billions of dollars fast and since we didnt know how long we could continue before matsuo noda figured out a way to stop us we were going to adhere to a schedule that covered the most vital sectors firstthose outfits whose r ampd tam considered strategic to americas future technological leadership our goal for the first day was five billion worldwide thus the countdown began hendersons financial artist loaded tams new program tape onto dnis big nec supercomputer and cranked up we had roughly sixty hours till the opening bell on monday chapter twentyseven its the worst of times buddy and the best of times whatever dude once said that didnt know the half of it he oughta be around now to check out the street that was hendersons georgia mafia coconspirator an irritatingly smug young man with red hair and acne who dressed entirely in white right down to his skinny italian tie we were told he went by the handle of jim bob as he meditated upon wall streets macroeconomic incongruities he punched a willie nelson tape into his boom box and popped a coors pregame warmup for programming a fullscale assault on the us securities markets jim bob allowed as how hed arrived in the big apple four years earlier with a cardboard suitcase a finance degree from georgia tech and a larger than regulation endowment of natural cunning after a couple of years toil in hendersons quasilegal vineyards hed gone out on his own whereupon hed parlayed his winnings with bill and the remnants of a baseball scholarship into what was now a high sixfigure haircut the name options players use for their grubstake the way he figured it he was just hitting his stride how i inquired at one point during that long weekend had he managed it chum its idiot simple you buy into fear sell into greed and fuck fundamentals main thing is if something makes sense dont do it americas in the alltime shit and wall streets oblivious its like everybodys bidding up standing room on the tttanic but who cares you play options like i do and all you have to worry about is not getting stupider than the herd which aint necessarily much of a trick stock options he went on to assert were like having a credit card in a whorehousea ton of action for what amounted to tip money up front no wonder las vegas was in trouble when wall street was beckoning our high rollers to take odds on the direction of the market only widows and orphans he observed bought actual securities anymore that action was reserved for the halt and lame while country singers twanged beer hall soliloquies on the general increase in faithless women jim bob coded in the brokerage houses and offshore banks wed be using the catalog of stocks in the dni portfolio and our sequence of transactions as noted earlier the financial setup had been handled by henderson and friends using his connections hed opened accounts for hundreds of dummy corporations in about two dozen offshore banks he stuck to the usual noquestionsasked operations like banca della svizzera italiana and bank leu in the bahamasthe latter a swissowned nassau laundry that had in years past reportedly destroyed records and lied to the securities and exchange commission as a favor to certain of americas more inventive inside traders since the volume of money to be moved was staggering it would all be handled by sophisticated telecommunications networks we would pass it through the anonymous accounts wed established accessed both ways by computer and it would never be touched by human hands dnis cash would flash in and out with total cover added to that anybody who tried to trace us would first have to break through a traditional swiss stone wall to dump the stock we were planning to exploit fully the new globalization of the financial scene now that the national association of securities dealers had struck a deal with the london and tokyo stock exchanges to swap price quotes worldwide market makers were buying and selling american securities around the clock plenty of active marketmaking was happening off the exchange floors as well at places like jeffries out on the coast which had recently handled a massive canadian takeover of an american company overnight entirely offexchange with all the avenues available it was almost impossible to track the movement in a given issue dnis computers would be routing sell orders to brokerage firms around the globe a block here a block there none of them in quantities that would raise eyebrows maybe i also should add that none of the corporations henderson had set up would be allowed to show a profit which would simplify treasury department reporting requirements as a matter of fact before we were through dni was going to lose billions but it would all be done legally in accordance with sec regs it would also lead to a world financial flap of notable proportions nobody would ever take nodas money for granted again while tam went over her new program with jim bob pointing out her special features henderson and i found ourselves at reasonably loose ends we sat around drinking green tea god how i came to hate that stuff and puzzling how wed all managed to get into such a mess the major plus however was that we finally had matsuo noda by the short and curlies or so we hoped the problem was hed been a player longer than any of us and hed already demonstrated plenty of stamina how would he counterattack the question wasnt if it was when for the moment though we seemed to be on our way with clear sailing in fact the communications link with kyoto was entirely empty tanaka also had clammed up refusing to talkbeyond a rather firm prediction that our wholesale divestiture of dnis assets was an insane act doomed to failure i might also add he didnt appear nearly as concerned as the circumstances would seem to merit in fact he was so complacent i started getting a little uneasy finally bill and i ran his prediction past young jim bob could somebody get through to tams program and devise a way to shut us down hendersons increasingly glassyeyed protege took out enough time from popping uppers and swilling coors to assure us to the contrary hell no way you could stop what were settin up here we got ourselves what you call a closed system everythings going to be handled by that greeneyed monster over there in the corner we got these numbered brokerage accounts all over the place zip in go the sell orders zap out go confirmations and since none of the cash sits around our bank accounts are all just gonna churn well have billions of buckaroos rollin at the speed of light aint nobody gonna be able to get a bead on the action take my word for it our computergenerated buying and selling he went on to declare was conveniently similar in appearance to the program trading of the big institutional investors the arbitrage players who routinely sold millions of dollars of securities in minutes using computers thanks to them the market these days had been conditioned to accept huge unaccountable trades as part of the territory if somebody dumped massive blocks of stock unexpectedly it could mean anythingsuch as the spread between those stocks prices and some index future had gotten momentarily out of sync shuffling securities like poker chips was the name of the game on the street these days so nobody would really notice or care the turnover wed be generating would merely suggest to the market that various investmenthouse arbitrage desks were unwinding positions what the heck i said to tam maybe we could unload the better part of dnis holdings before noda struck back the real key to our attack on dai nippon however depended on what happened to that cash after we turned it around when i mentioned that she just crossed her fingers by late sunday night the dni offices were a clutter of empty chinese takeout containers kentucky fried chicken boxes and computer printouts however jim bob claimed the system looked like a go hed completed a long sequence of test runs and he was predicting he could probably swing at least four billion the first day something in the nature of a warmup for grander things to come jim bob i should say was fully as efficient as advertised by henderson even if he was now flying higher than a moon shot thanks to all the pills he worked methodically carefully analyzing the program at every step doublechecking the codes poring over his verification printouts for obscure glitches mainly though he kept one unfocused eye on the clock saying he always delivered on time point of honor thus it was that when monday morning rolled around we were primed to move on wall street tams program was poised inside the mainframe like some lurking id ready to be unleashed we decided to start modestly sticking to the exchanges in new york and only later in the day expanding outward as we gained firmer footing at the stroke of ninethirty am jim bob inaugurated our maiden run with yet another beer henderson and i poured ourselves a bourbon tam even joined us accepting a respectable shot fasten your seat belts boys and girls jim bob shakily peeled back the tab on his coors the screen in front of him focused our attention down to one small flashing green dot ignition he hit a key on the terminal and merrill lynch got a computerized sell order for ten thousand shares of texas instruments the time was exactly it was a textbook liftoff rows of green numbers began to scroll up the screen only to blink and disappear by god the thing seemed to be working we had just pulled the plug on dni all that was left now was to sit back and watch it sink as the morning wore on tam fielded phone calls from staffers always claiming that tanaka was not available just then of course we werent sure how long we could get away with that excuse but for now none of us wanted to set the man free to start jabbering in japanese on the phone on the other hand we were loosening up a bit on security partly i guess because we were all increasingly wrecked but also because it seemed to fit the situation by monday tanaka and his two retired sumo bonecrushers appeared to have grown resigned one might even say philosophical and i dont mind admitting it bothered me a lot tanaka was watching us destroy nodas grand design right before his very eyes yet he just sat there as though none of it mattered how could this be all he did was busy around brewing tea for everybody except of course for jim bob who stuck to coors however i was too tired by then to think much about it around twothirty henderson began complaining of a splitting headache and declared he had to go home and get some rest i started to protest but the man looked half dead tam and i werent much better off so we flipped a coin to see who would take the first watch she won which was great by me since the long hours without sleep were really starting to unravel my concentration to understand what happened next you have to try and envision the scene it was three pm and things were going letter perfectly the dollars were sailing through the accounts wed set up and along about noon wed even kicked in our buy program yes buy thats not a typo you see we had to lose billions not necessarily a trivial task think about it if you merely want to drop a few million all you have to do is just invest in some highflying startup and then sit there till the venture craters but billions thats the part where tam really showed her mettle no pun intended look she said the brothers hunt managed to blow millions by trying to corner silver bidding up the price and then seeing it collapse but weve got to get rid of some serious money so why dont we do the same thing only with a commodity worth something platinum all lifes great ideas have an inevitable simplicity thats right we were programmed to sell dnis stock and buy platinum from anybody anywhere at any price we were planning to just swallow the worldwide commodity markets in the stuff starting at the ny merc and ending at capetown of course what we were also doing was boosting its price into the stratospherewe were even bidding against ourselves through different brokerage houses anything to drive it up i mean we had a lot of money to get rid of we figured that by the time we were finished dni would be the proud owner of a couple of hundred billion in platinum metal platinum futures platinum mining stocks platinum storage companies platinum dealerships platinum reserves platinum investment coins all of it at a price as high as we could push i was betting on two thousand dollars an ounce by friday the nice part was what central bank was going to step in platinum was strategic sure but it wasnt a monetary metal and if we had to bid against governments so much the better we were playing a drunken speculators dream going all out for the most volatile of all the worlds commodities after wed squeezed that scam for every ounce it was worth we would deliberately puncture the bubble and let the price nosedive we were going to destroy the cancer of dai nippon by gorging nodas takeover machine with financial poison the eventual collapse should wipe out matsuo noda totally platinum i asked jim bob to check the waning moments of mondays spot market the latest prices down at the ny merc and he reported it had scooted up about twenty dollars an ounce a little slow maybe but then we were just starting out i figured it would probably double in a couple of days such was my fond hope as i drifted off for a nap on my desk tam was in tanakas office halfnodding in her chair while jim bob was sitting before his monitor still nourishing himself with beer and colored pills i gave him the uzi and told him to help tam out by keeping an eye on tanaka and the two guards all now sleeping like a baby my last vision was of jim bob sitting there the uzi draped over his wrinkled white lap clicking away at the keyboard i slept right through emmas fouroclock phone call from my office downtown when i awoke around nine pm jim bob mentioned shed rung no message he said then dont worry about it i mumbled to myself get back to her in the morning tam didnt seem to remember the call which momentarily troubled me had we both been dozing at the helm well who could blame her in spite of my own nap i still felt like hell so i dragged myself up stretched wandered around the office drank some more green tea and inquired of jim bob how things seemed to be proceeding looking good he grinned he was now working hong kong and the asian exchanges limbering up the satellites as he flashed our dnis money around the globe anybody heard from henderson not a word he said in a tone that seemed disconcertingly pat i briefly toyed with heading down to the street and trying to locate an early bulldog times to see what kind of a splash we were making in the press but since tam was now sound asleep i figured id better stick to duty i vaguely recall stumbling into my office to rummage for an old box of nodoz stashed somewhere there in the desk and thinking how nice it would be just to lean back in the chair a phone was jangling in my ear as i pulled erect the clock on my desk was reading tenthirtymy god amand i felt as if id been run over by an eighteenwheeler what the hell was in that green tea tanaka had been brewing inside the receiver at my ear was emma and what she had to say brought me awake like an icecold shower in a voice brimming with triumph she announced shed just resigned and i could consider this official notice thereof in fact she was priceshopping florida condos this very minutewhat did i think of coral gablesand i was lucky shed bothered to take out time to inform me of her intended plans by wednesday she expected to be able to loan money to the rockefellers in case they should need a little liquidity on short notice howd you come by this sudden fortune i asked where she snapped back have you been the dow jones average was about to double if it hadnt already funny but the rest of the market was going nowhere oddest thing shed ever seen however it only went to show what shed always told me and if id listened to her instead of those smartypants uptown brokers id be rich now too stick with the blue chips ibm was up thirty percent since yesterday at ampt was flying gm was selling for a price that would make you think they were back in the car business what the hell was she talking about thats when i noticed a copy of tuesdays new york times lying there on my desk right next to the phone only at first it didnt seem like the times or maybe punch sulzberger had just been swallowed whole by rupert murdoch because i hadnt seen a headline that arresting since the posts immortal coed jogger slain in bed it was banner right across the top the times headline writer was practically orgasmic but whereas the post gets off on mere sex the good gray times reserves its libidinous juices for that ageless aphrodisiac money new york stock exchange prices explode new yorkvolume skyrocketed on the floor of the new york stock exchange yesterday as buyers for big board issues responded worldwide to a renewed confidence in american industry analysts are calling this the first leg of the great bull market of the s saying this surge has been overdue for a decade leading the phenomenal rally were a number of americas foremost corporations i came off my chair like a shot and headed for tams office is anybody following whats going on outside her face was down on the desk dark hair tousled across her cheeks she looked up and rubbed her eyes obviously knocked out too strange what her voice was slurred somethings gone crazy i yelled wheres henderson then i remembered he wasnt there however i did locate jim bob easily enough he was in nodas corner office wideawake and still carrying our uzi only now there were two of those long black automatics present the other lying atop the wide teakwood desk one more thing seated behind that desk his silver hair framed by the sunlight streaming through the wide back windows was matsuo noda the shogun had arrived and with him came the dawn of a new powerful reality my drugged mind was flooded with the ramifications matsuo noda i now realized had been on to us from the start once again he had used us he had been the one who had emptied the office the better to lure us in but the guards nodasan i bow to a true samurai a swordsmans swordsman of course it was as simple as it was elegant you were testing us allowing us a plausible opening just difficult enough to force us to reveal our true strategy the dictum of the masters if you want to strike your enemy let him try to strike you first the moment he strikes you you have already succeeded in striking him pure bushido everything up till now had only been feints what i assumed was the battle turned out to have merely been staking out terrain jockeying for position at last though we were ready for the real engagement trouble was matsuo noda had just secured the high ground come on in and have yourself a seat walton jim bob beckoned toward the vacant chair as he sipped from a glass of california champagne its plasticlooking bottle stationed on the floor beside him coors time was over jim bob whats happening with the market i was ignoring noda for the moment trying to get a firmer grasp on the new prevailing conditions bout what we figured he replied his white suit now greasy and wrinkled yep looks like were roughly on schedule its a relief to know theres a timetable i finally turned to noda wouldnt want this takeover to be halfcocked mr walton if you would be so kind he smiled and indicated the chair it would be well for you to join us jim bob waved me over with his uzi fact is were all about due for a little show and tell he glanced up as tarn entered the doorway be a good idea if you got up to speed on what were doing here too i just scrolled some prices she said glaring groggily at noda the morbid realization descending rapidly now you dont have to tell me anything i know exactly what youre doing what were doing is were pulling this country out of the shit thats what were doing were saving this countrys ass which is more than anybody else heres doing jim bob continued satisfaction in his voice how in hell did you ever think you could pull something like you were trying mr noda here could squash you all just like a june bug anytime he gets a mind take my word for it noda still hadnt amplified the new dai nippon scenario but he didnt really need to bother jim bob dont spoil the fun and tell me let me try to guess i glanced over at noda then back at him he suckered you in with his rescue america spiel world peace at a price well tell you the truth the man did buy me lunch ill bet thats not all he did you opportunistic son of a bitch i examined noda how does it feel to have japan about to be sole owner of ibm and at ampt and gm and guess i could just check the supercomputer out there for the full list certain strategic corporations noda smiled benignly it had become the only meaningful direction to proceed mr walton im afraid our other measures were clearly too little too late why bother with the small fish right if youre going to buy up american technology do it right mr walton we both know it is inevitable neither you nor i can alter the tides of history he sighed perhaps japan can provide the management guidance required to save americas industrial base but it cannot be achieved merely by dabbling stronger measures much stronger were required i finally came to see that the problem was how to do it without a major psychological disruption of the market and more japan bashing then by the greatest of good fortune you solved my problem for me he nodded toward tam your new trading program dr richardson which allowed us to operate anonymously was ideal why not make use of it particularly since mr henderson had the personnel to render it operational while digesting that i returned my attention to jim bob let me guess some more ten to one you bought call options on the big board issues he was planning to take over well they were bound to go up he flashed a reptilian grin as he adjusted the uzi now a bolt of black against his rumpled white suit if youre standing by the road and a gravy bus comes along what are you going to do terrific be a pity for this insider windfall to go to waste just wanted to make double sure you got a piece for yourself does a bear crap in the woods he inquired rhetorically then tipped back his head and drained the champagne glass right so naturally you bought call options on the blue chips locking in a cheap price just before nodas money boosted them into the clouds safe and simple of course some traders go for index options s ampp s and indicators like that but thats always been too airyfairy for me when the markets set to head up i just buy calls heavy leverage no risk i concurred nothing too abstruse the thing of it is im more comfortable dealing with reality he went on i like to kick the tires check under the hood so that index craps not my style like i always say if youve got hold of something you cant figure out how to drink drive or screw maybe you oughta ask yourself what youre doing with it a pragmatic criterion i agreed though its rather a pity you didnt cut me in on the play i could have used the money walton he replied it downright pains me to have to be the one breakin the news to you but you could have used the money more than you think whose bank balances do you figure ive been using to test out that platinum program in the spirit of intellectual curiosity jim bob does our new system for blowing capital show promise from the looks of my early churning id say you got yourself a winner the fucker how in hell did he get access to my money i decided to just ask whereupon he obligingly explained well were hooked into every bank computer in town he was unblinking a druggedout zombie account numbers arent exactly a state secret given the right phone call same goes for trust funds trust funds let me be sure ive got this straight youve also wiped out my daughter amys college money shes now penniless too were close real close he reached down and retrieved the bottle then sloshed more of the cheap bubbly into his glass im figuring i can have everything down to a goose egg by sometime round about lunch probably i decided then and there i was going to kill him and matsuo noda with my own bare hands the only question was whether to do it at that moment or later jim bob for the record you twove just fucked with the wrong guy when somebody starts messing with amys future i tend to lose my sense of proportion nothing personal walton you just had to be stopped thats all he grinned figured itd get your attention besides way i see it this man heres absolutely right hes got the only answer that makes any sense as long as sellout artists like you get rich in the process its in the grand american tradition buddy enlightened selfinterest better known as looking out for number one everybody else heres hocking this countrys assets to japan and gettin rich doing it so why not besides weve still got a ways to go time to give youall a piece of this thing too if we play ball exactly you greedy prick i was considering just strangling him on the spot nice and uncomplicated nodas not here for anybody but himself hes thats not the way i see it he glanced over toward the man who was still silent as a sphinx you wouldnt have the brains to understand even if we told you but maybe theres something you can comprehend i glanced at the metal grip of the uzi on nodas desk one lightning move and it was in my hand im not going to let you do this its already done pal he lifted his own uzi and leveled it at my forehead grinning his little idea of a joke ive got that nec mainframe out there programmed for weeks of trading billions pow he jerked the barrel upward then continued way ive got it rigged aint nobody can turn it off now wed just as well all go fishing jim bob take care with that gun somebody might just decide to ram it down your scrawny throat aint gonna be you buddy he reached for the champagne bottle again no longer grinning mr walton finally noda spoke again i assure you this is for the best what you two were planning was very illconsidered not to mention that if id actually permitted you to sink dai nippons capital into some volatile commodity and then manipulate the markets you might have given our institutional investors an enormous loss of confidence in my program i have a responsibility to make sure that never happens he studied tam dr richardson you especially disappointed me you betrayed my trust something i always find unforgivable you betrayed my trust she looked ready to explode lied to me exploited me used me you perverted everything i had planned as ive explained this had become necessary there was no other way how about ken and probably allan stern she interrupted was taking their lives necessary too you have no proof of that he continued smoothly i would further suggest that too much speculation is not a healthy pursuit dr richardson in the marketplace or in life im not speculating as you wish in any case i think we both realize it is never prudent to meddle in matters beyond ones concern theres a small detail you may have overlooked nodasan i broke in that bogus sword what are you planning to do when we blow the whistle my timetable for nipponica is now proceeding on schedule mr walton he glanced at the uzi on the desk his voice ice consequently you are expendable as of this moment chapter twentyeight if the swordsman casts aside two thoughts life and death nothing can defeat his mind that was the credo of the formidable warriorsamurai bokuden who lived during the early seventeenth century focus on noda i told myself not on staying alive what we had to do was overcome him and the money of japan by the power of mind by beating him at his own game that was the only way we could win as i saw it we might actually have the advantage we knew his strategy so all we had to do now was move inside his defense perimeter in a way we were even closer than he realized noda was obsessed with nipponica and a samurai concentrating on his sword is not able to attack the thing to remember was rhythm the beat we had to get out of sync with him disrupt his pacing when tam and i retreated to my office i noticed that my katana was missing no surprise but it didnt really matter we would be using the no sword technique anyway moving under his hilt then going in for the kill jim bob would be our new weapon at the moment nodas new hatchet man was strolling around the floor in his dingy white suit toting his uzi and monitoring us with an occasional vacant stare as he watched the terminals flash his bumpkin facade incidentally had to be the best acting job id seen since the royal shakespeare he may have been a spacedout options hustler at heart but he could coach machiavelli on duplicity a worthy opponent just hit nine percent of ibm he glanced at a crt screen as he ambled down the row next to my office swinging the automatic telephone looks good for twelve percent by opening bell tomorrow good thing weve got a computer and these fake accounts otherwise we might have to cut the sec in on the news a little too early well dni was nothing if not organized global trading was on a roll there would be no way to trace nodaor to stop him by the time anybody realized what was afoot hed be well on the way to having us literally bought out god knows japan had the money jim bob i yelled across mind telling me what the hell it is you really think youre up to im making history he grinned and waved his uzi in the air youre getting to watch the dawn of a new age for your wallet i beckoned him over tell me something you didnt actually sell any of the hightech stocks on tams list after all did you hell no he was still grinning all we did was play games a little whenever i sold anything i just turned around and bought it back a few minutes later so wheres all the money coming from for this big blue chip takeover we got a whole new financial network in place mr noda worked it out with the pension funds over there well it seems to me you ought to be doing this thing right why think small pick up some more shares of those hightech issues in the old portfolio too he stared at me with his bloodshot eyes how come wed want to bother with that just thought maybe youd like to make a score huh besides down the line itd probably impress hell out of noda the man admires initiative what was it you said about a score he was blinking in erratic bursts still flying on uppers forget it just a crazy idea that crossed my mind i turned and walked back into the office where tam was waiting what was that all about tam did you hear what those bastards did i was steaming they blew my daughters college money i heard well it pisses me off like i cant begin to describe i gathered that she looked at me strangely he finally got to you didnt he noda finally pulled your cork no more mr cool you got it lady she continued to study me and into her eyes crept a kind of affection i didnt even know they possessed guess that makes two of us matt he found out how to get to me and now hes found out the one thing you care about guess he did at that well now you know how i feel he broke the rules tam thats not part of the game but do you understand what this means now im free to do anything i want honor is out the window this isnt a game youre right its a battle but even battles have rules my god macho to the end call it what you want but i am now going to destroy them both totally wipe them out theyve given me no choice how exactly do you propose doing that i made the opening move just now next im later i glanced up to see jim bob approaching he was staring at me glassyeyed what was that you were saying a while ago dont remember jim bob something about a score oh that nothing really dont start getting cute walton he sighted his uzi around the office nobody screws with you right better believe it sport well i was just wondering since nodas tied up at the moment if you might want to go ahead and make a little money on the side im not doing so bad fine since youre not interested anyway we can just skip it no big deal hang on a second his eyes seemed to be trying to focus as he stared through his gunsights whats the play merely a wild idea thats all i was wondering what would happen if you bought a few call options on those stocks already in the portfolio then boosted the prices on those too you mean on those hightech outfits we were supposed to start selling well the setups just sitting out there youve got all that japanese pension money and nodas computer no reason not to kite those hightech issues a little and pick up some pocket change fun and games to while away the time but then maybe youve already made all you want to hey asshole theres two things you cant ever get too much of and one of thems money he was rocking mechanically matter of fact this action were generating is driving up the march calls for our new buys to the point where the price is getting way out of line had to happen everybody else in town has figured out somebodys driving the market theyre getting on the options bandwagon too bidding them up so why not play a little market shellgame with those issues already in the portfolio buy some calls and then kite the price on them as well show noda a thing or two kind of stick it to the boss man he paused think of it as insurance just to make sure you come out of this play whole tell you a secret about noda with that guy you know youve got a deal when the check clears hes a crafty fucker grant you you might want to give it some thought but if youre going to make a move its probably now or never be the early bird or forget it all this time tam was looking at me as if id gone over the edge i began to deeply regret not having filled her in on the fallback scenario the door to nodas office was now closed his two guards posted outside guess even a samurai needs some rest and tranquility after flying halfway around the globe in a chartered concorde well gotta admit its an idea jim bob continued to weave unsteadily his motor mechanisms were now on automatic along with his venal cornpone brain matt what in hell are you doing tam was pulling me back into the office stay cool swordsmanship is like zen you cant ever let your mind get attached to anything do that and youre stuck your mind stays with the past and makes you neglect what lies ahead so i figure the best thing to do here is to adjust to the new prevailing conditions i glanced out at jim bob now just beyond the door and absently humming some waylon jennings tune as he swayed solo well i want to know what youre up to okay heres the play while you were setting up your selloff scheme i did some fiddling on my own remember back when we started out i fasttalked noda into giving me power of attorney well it finally paid off last week i convened an instant shareholders meeting for every company where dni owns a majority of the stock and personally voted through a new set of resolutions mind filling me in on what they were before i could reply jim bob came dancing in licking his pale lips walton tell you what think im gonna go for it what i looked up that options play comes a time you gotta look out for yourself and fuck everybody thats the kind of thinking made this country what it is today jim bob right on fuckin a baby he did a quick dance step go for the gold you know as long as were at it how about a little piece of the action for me too nothing big just a couple of bucks for old times sake why the hell not he let out a whoop as he turned and headed for a terminal give you sloppy seconds on this one ace just long as i get first pop matt i dont know what youre up to but ill kill you if you start helping him she looked like she would too you know you once said you wanted to drive a stake into dnis heart i turned back well this is your chance but weve got to get moving and do it before noda catches on whereupon we joined jim bob in front of his monitor he was now busy pulling up quotes for march calls on the chicago board options exchange the cboe he checked them over then got on the phone directly to the market makers on the floor when youre operating in hyperdrive you dont dawdle around with brokers jim bob while youre doing that i think ill just start setting up the buy orders for the stock if we want to move prices weve got to have coordination yahoo lets kick some ass hed just entered a wholly new dimension of exuberance shit fire and save your matches fuck a duck and see what hatches my sentiments precisely i started scrolling up dnis portfolio of hightech securities looking for the biggies if things went as planned our screwing of matsuo noda was definitely going to be memorable now jim bob was chortling quietly to himself as he punched up more numbers moving on to bilk options traders on the amex matthew youd better finish explaining what youre up to tam was standing behind me her hand gripping my shoulder look we have to do this fast switch a beat on noda break his rhythm just trust me my favorite word she didnt move nowi pointed to a column of green numbers on the lefthand side of the screenare those the percentage holdings dni has looks correct they were about what i remembered dnis positions varied from around fifty percent to the low sixties okay i turned to face her which of these do you want to knock out first there may not be time to torpedo them all what are you going to do she was frowning but i could tell the idea had appeal set dynamite under them just blow them skyhigh how using an obscure corporate antitakeover tactic not many people know about yet jim bobs right were going to make history nobodys ever done this on the scale youre about to witness just pick the stocks you want detonated first but please hurry i shoved a pen and paper at her then turned to watch jim bob now dancing around with a phone in his ear still buying calls on the old dni portfolio howre we doing over there chief dont want to push march too hard tip off the market so im picking up some junes too he yelled my way were going long baby jim bob i was just wondering dont you think you ought to hedge a little just in case maybe buy a few puts to cover the downside with the kind of volatility im about to goose into this market youre starting to sound like some pussy walton get naked go native only way to fly he did a twirl then a kick just buckle in dude cause im gonna take that jap money and pump my underlying stocks right into orbit this plays a lock taking money from a baby well i wasnt blessed with your brand of raw courage jim bob so what do you say i do a little hedging for you well be partners ill cover the downside with my own money assuming ive got any left ill buy a few puts and then if these stock prices just decide to go crazy and crash we can still sell at the current quotes protect ourselves if things head south for some reason suit yourself but thats the best way i can think of to piss away what little haircut youve got left he was grinning again guess im a masochist what can i tell you while my new partner was laying the groundwork for his scam loading up on options to buy stocks at todays prices just before he turned around and shoved enough japanese money into the market to send them skyhigh i did the opposite i got on the phone to various brokers including a currently jubilant sam kline and started buying at the money puts in amys name jim bob was betting the market would head up buying calls i was betting it would go down buying puts i was laying a wager with anybody in america who would agree for my front money to buy a stock from me at todays quotes anytime through midmarch even if the real price had since dropped to zilch which i fully intended to make happen insider trading well yes you see i was literally the only man on earth who actually knew what the stock market was going to do next after dni started buying more of those stocks id planted with land mines but i was a driven man just then maybe id go to jail eventually but by god amy would still make college amy what was she doing today i wondered this was what tuesday so she must be back at school probably thinking about lunch strawberry yogurt and a bar of tigers milk health candy god i loved that little darkhaired prize more than life itself where were we headed she and i was i going to learn to let go maybe that wasnt going to be the problem i thought at least for her face it i was about to become a fixture just a stuffy impediment to natures raging hormones shed already started rehearsing feminine wiles on me practicing that coy downcast glance that didnt quite break subliminal eye contact where did she learn stuff like that and she almost had it down cold next itll probably be eye shadow and colored bras damn this christmas was going to be my last real chance to get to know her to bore her silly with all my eminently ignorable fatherly advice and i blew it that in itself was enough to make me want to deepsix matsuo noda forever the bastard the money i fully planned to recoup her thirteenth christmas was gone forever with which somber thought i returned to buying puts by the time id finished tam had her death wish list ready and jim bob was just wrapping up his new program of calloption acquisition now for phase two i strolled over to his monitor carrying her paper jim bob these might be a good place to start i tossed the sheet down beside his keyboard why not just set up a lot of buy orders to hit the market tomorrow at the opening doing it all at once should drive the prices straight up right he leaned back twitching wonder how much buying itll take well why not play it safe use the computer and just boost dnis hightech portfolio another oh five percent straight across the board every issue program it and let her rip youve already got tams sell setup all you have to do is turn it around sounds good to me now he was swaying to and fro humming tonelessly then lets get rolling you hit amex and the big board tam and ill see if we cant drop orders for a few blocks on jeffries the offexchange network we have to make waves at the opening bell tomorrow hear you talkin these issues gotta look like major movers he was beaming from ear to ear as he revolved shakily back to his terminal damn if i dont jus love screwing the market we went to work and for the next half hour we transmitted buy orders to the farthest reaches of the globe once they were posted it didnt matter when theyd be executed even if noda killed us a hand from the grave would come back and destroy him the time bomb id set would blow the minute the sec tallied up dnis new holdings there were about to be a lot of rich happy workers in this land of the free but the one man certain not to be among their number was matsuo noda speaking of which mr walton would you kindly explain what you are doing i froze realizing he was standing directly behind my chair how long had he been there id been too absorbed to pay attention stupid walton extremely stupid tell you the truth nodasan i wheeled around and looked him in the eye shielding the screen sometimes you have to make the best of things discretions the better part of valor so were told im familiar with the expression he appeared less than convinced who knows maybe nipponica is the way to go we needed time just a little more time in any case im a firm believer in riding the horse the direction its going so i persuaded jim bob to buy a few options for me trouble is the guys a little tentative on reality just now decidedly he glanced over at our mutual friend now typing away obliviously then turned and moved on toward the water cooler next to my office did he believe me maybe he actually thought we would just roll over and give up or possibly noda was in that unconscious mindstate that goes along with real mastery in swordsmanship when a zen archer discharges an arrow his concentration must never be on that shaft it must be on nothing and the same is true with swordsmanship your mind must be in its natural state empty of distractions so if noda allowed himself to focus on the small stuff right now hed forfeit his no mind edge well we were about through anyway the only thing left was to keep him occupied just long enough for jim bob to finish sending out the last of our buys the sword was a masterful idea nodasan i got up and walked over to join him howd you manage it mr walton what exactly do you know about the emperor antokus imperial sword he sipped from a plastic cup eyes squinting behind his rimless specs probably more than i should then you will understand its recovery is a turning point in the history of japan i looked at him and realized he believed it actually believed it matsuo noda had become a legend in his own mind why tamper with perfection have to admit too the idea of using our international bank cover to gobble up americas blue chips incognito was a stroke of genius congratulations youre about to scare miti and the rest of japan half to death not to mention the world with dni heading up the management who knows what could happen you can probably write your own ticket back home after this your friend dr hendersons young colleague was invaluable was alas poor jim bob did that mean he wasnt going to live long enough to spend the new fortune he thought he was about to make maybe noda was planning to do half of my work for me i guess a few of those phone taps you like so much led you straight to him right you were probably at least a day ahead of everything we did good intelligence is vital to any successful endeavor mr walton you should remember that from sun tzus classic art of war the man was right on all these dummy corporations i was still running the stall a little stock bought by each one the sec will never suspect you just roll trades worldwide till as long as necessary who knows youre doing this was it possible some rogue financier such as noda really could pull a fast one on the whole world use japanese institutional money for whatever he pleased have you cleared this with the fund managers it was not necessary mr walton i have long since earned the trust of my colleagues again he had a weird look in his eye matsuo noda i realized was currently operating from a distant planet needless to say our dialogue hadnt done a lot to calm my nervous system the obvious solution to nodas secrecy requirements didnt include a lengthy life span for a lot of loudmouthed gaijin time to wrap up the stock market games and get back to swordsmanship at this point theres only one problem left but i suppose youve already thought of it too if word of this anonymous takeover breaks too soon the exchanges might just decide to shut down trading and stop you which means were all a threat to you at this point he stood unmoving that matter will be addressed presently how soon i wondered was presently but havent you forgotten somebody bill henderson the mans no fool the minute he figures out your play which he surely will hes going to start blowing word all over the newspapers youll never get away with this noda smiled lightly it would be helpful if he were here now perhaps you could be good enough to arrange for it so with matsuo noda standing over me uzi next to my head i called henderson on my speakerphone he picked up after eight rings bill getting rich walton what time is it goddam you woke me up he yawned into the receiver jesus i feel like hell whats going on everything still looking okay couldnt be better quite a party around here want to come back down and help us celebrate well what the its after eleven already hey let me check out the market first be down there in a little i looked up as noda fingered his uzi just come on over now dont putz around with the market we could use the company and bill yeah this shindigs byob so how about picking up a fifth of scotch that way we can all get into the spirit of things here on the eleventh floor walton thats a hell of a i know bringing your own booze is not your style but why dont you check in with eddie the security chief downstairs he always keeps me a bottle of suntory there in the utility room see him about it that japanese crap matt what are you talking about you know i hate just ask for eddie bill i cut him off tell him matthew walton wants his black label japanese juice sent up here immediately understand i hung up before henderson could say anything more such as tell me we both knew there was no such thing as black label suntory guess hell be here shortly i turned back to noda he should be here in no time at all mr walton two of my guards have been posted outside his building since he returned there yesterday for his own safety they will bring him with that chilling bit of news matsuo noda proceeded to yank out the phone cord then head back to his office the art of war you leave nothing to chance in fact his two sumo heavies were now standing outside my office keeping a close eye on us guess he no longer had full confidence in jim bob tam did you catch what just happened id walked back over to the terminals i did she was staring into space henderson was our best hope to get out of here alive he has a suspicious mind the equal of sherlock holmess but now matt whats he going to do to us all dont think itll be pretty then shed turned and was staring at the security entrance wearing a quizzical expression i wheeled around to look too and at first i thought i might have been hallucinating a female figure was emerging through the doors wearing an outfit whose style i couldnt quite place maybe it was one of those bulky creations such as yohji yamamoto or some other avantgarde japanese designer might dream up but it didnt resemble anything id ever seen before silk like a kimono yet with a flowing quality ancient almost then i had a vision just offbeat enough to fit an ink illustration out of the the tale of genji flashed before my eyes and i realized i was seeing a hakama something that hadnt been around the streets of japan for roughly eight hundred years the woman in it was wearing peculiar makeup not punk though it might have been it was pale like the delicate ink shadings on a heian hand scroll she looked for all the world like a court lady of ages past shed have fit right in at some heian linkedverse soiree old kyoto come to life is this the latest neonew wave what in good christ the only uncoordinated touch was the handbag leather and starkly modern with a lock attached jim bob gave her a glazed stare as she moved right past him headed for us the sumo pair was bowing to the floor well well the emperors most devoted courtier had finally arrived into our presence on this day of days had returned none other than ms akira mori one look at her eyes told me shed come to kill somebody chapter twentynine mr walton where is the silver case shed walked straight up to us and now was just standing there awaiting an answer morisan that silver box is long gone thanks to noda i suddenly felt as if wed just dropped out of the twentieth century and back into the twelfth time warp let me tell you something it was like the apple in the garden of eden bite into it and out would spew the knowledge of good and evil better to forget the whole thing you dont know anything definite point weve just discovered there was a heck of a lot we didnt know i thumbed toward nodas office including the scope of dai nippons impressive new investment program she ignored that response entirely as she whirled on tam her voice increasingly strident dr richardson you have betrayed his majesty morisan you and everybody whos helping noda are the ones whove done the betraying tam stared her in the eye daggers even though you are fujiwara you still let him continue mori pressed on oblivious his scheme to manipulate the emperor to undermine miti thats got nothing to do with it is the duty of a fujiwara to protect his majesty speaking of his majesty i cut in how much did you have to do with nodas fake sword guess that protected the emperor too nothing like being handed a new lease on divinity the sword was to be his gift to me she said it hesitantly to restore perhaps we can clarify what its really intended to restore morisan i interrupted again the shogunate with noda as she turned on me and you helped him too what you and asanosan stole the only thing i could have used to stop him the contents of that silver case and then this operation after id tried to warn you both morisan could be were all acting under certain misunderstandings here today for starters buying up every american blue chip issue in sight was not exactly our idea she stared at me for a second disbelieving but that is precisely what you are doing think again i pointed toward nodas office thats his game helped along by that sharpshooter over at the console i waved to jim bob who toasted us with his champagne glass still too zonked on uppers to comprehend the revised ground rules maybe youd like to run through it with them she seemed to notice him for the first time who is that person nodas new hired gun weve been retired without even so much as a gold watch he is the one responsible hes good tell you that fooled us all i settled onto the office couch nodas got him and this supercomputer looks like goodbye america nodas office door incidentally was still firmly closed so presumably he wasnt yet aware of moris arrival were we about to see history replayed before our very eyes that fateful battle of dannoura staged all over again eight hundred years later as a loyal retainer of the emperor fought to thwart the armed takeover of a wouldbe shogun wonder who was going to win this time around mr walton this must be stopped she was turning the key on her new leather handbag unlocking it i also insist you return your copy of the contents of that case having that is the only way i can morisan not so long ago the contents of that silver box were very dear to our hearts which is one reason we took the precaution of storing a facsimile on the harddisk memory of the mainframe here now there are about ten zillion files in that computer so all you have to do is figure out what file name we used and you can just run off all the copies you want i got up and faced her at the moment though therere more pressing worries you are playing with fire mr walton she glanced at the computer room down at the other end of the floor no kidding this is a tough game weve got going maybe youd like to get an update from the other team too noda and his new crony are you saying he is the one she was pointing toward jim bob who was now winding up the last dispatch of our new buy orders i noticed it was the third time she had inquired dont take our sayso for it go ask him without a word she spun around leaving a cloud of exquisite floral perfume in her wake tell the truth i rather liked the designer outfit what you might call a real classic what i didnt care for all that much were the vibes very very ominous as she strode toward jim bob he watched her with an unfocused gaze he apparently assumed it was all some costumeparty gag definitely a major mistake i am akira mori probably by then he no longer knew what he was seeing he revolved around adjusted the uzi leaning against the console and extended his paw pleased to make your acquaintance jim bob mcclinton you work for mr noda in a manner of speaking she ignored the proffered handshake is it true you are now in his employ i was at the moment though im taking care of myself americanstyle if you want to know whatever you are doing i hereby order you to terminate all activities in this office immediately jim bob just stared at her not quite sure his brain wasnt playing more tricks well now id normally like to oblige a pretty lady like yourself but im afraid i just dont have any intention of doing that he grinned eyes flashing are you telling me you refuse you hear real good he reached down for the uzi and his bloodshot eyes began to blink far as that goes where i come from were not used to takin orders from cute little twats so the best thing for you to do would be to shake your ass out of my way and mind your own business or maybe go talk things over with noda he thumbed toward the office in there she was opening her handbag reaching inside jim bob i was wanting to yell this woman is neither cute nor little above all she is definitely not a twat you are now facetoface with a world heavyweight ballbreaker who may be about to take that uzi youre so proud of and tie it around your scrofulous neck this game is way over your head cant you see where its headed matt whats she doing tam bolted forward sad to say everybody was too late including henderson by probably no more than a second or so i watched jim bob swing around his automatic and then the lights went out we heard the dull thunk of a silencer followed by another and next the sound of a chair crashing backward an uzi clattering across the floor it was indeed dannoura all over again only this time the shoguns forces had just taken the first hit but at least henderson must have eluded nodas gorillas howd he do it whatever had happened hed gotten the message suntory black hed had eddie yank the master switch for the eleventh floor he blacked out dai nippon for what good it did not much as things transpired hed only cut the overheads the computer must have had its own backup power some circuit that didnt run through the main utility room the office was now eerily illuminated by crt screens still buying blue chips as usual noda had prepared for all eventualities gingerly we inched out onto the floor jim bob was sprawled beside his console in a spreading pool of blood maybe he was still alive maybe not tam reached down to check the pulse at his neck its gone she looked up stunned who was next more to the point where the hell was mori then we saw her moving like a ghostly figure in a no play gliding through the bizarre limecolored light of the terminals we watched as she disappeared into nodas office trailed by the two dumbstruck guards what a standoff i reflected fleetingly the wouldbe shogun versus the emperors number one fan this time though the imperial side is hopping mad and loaded for bear wonder wholl there was however something more important to think about the next few seconds could turn everything around this was hardly the time for historical meditations with deliberate haste we might even live long enough for some history of our own later in the dim glow of the screens tam grabbed jim bobs uzi and we both dived for nodas office the door happily had just slammed shut since it was the kind that opened out all we had to do was shove a desk against it and they were contained now how much time did we have the mainframe she was staring through the green shadows toward the glassedin room that contained the massive nec matthew weve got to shut it down somehow thats the only way left to stop him is there an onoff switch who knew how you went about disconnecting a twentymilliondollar supercomputer were about to find out she led the way the entry door was glass halfinch and locked beyond it stood the string of sixfoothigh modules offwhite and octagonal lined up like squat soldiers on flooring elevated about six inches above that outside the nerve center of nodas empire rested there on its platform silent and secure tam pass me that thing i reached for the uzi turned it around and rammed the steel butt against the glass then again it just bounced off harder okay but stand away i hauled back and swing at it with all my might with a sickening crunch the glass shattered inward spewing shards across the icy tiles inside an alarm went off somewhere out on the floor but we just ignored it after id punched away a few hanging pieces we stepped in and up i handed back the uzi now what its freezing in here she shivered from the cold then pointed down you know all the wiring must be underneath this raised floor theres no way to even know where the power conduit is let alone reach it okay guess well just have to start ripping my heart skipped a beat as my eyes adjusted to the dim light i finally noticed what i should have seen immediately lying atop the big computation module was a thin fourfoot long bundle swathed in silk so theres where he decided to put itin the one room that would always be locked or maybe he thought it should be kept in the most powerful location on the premises i reached up and retrieved it then pulled away the silk the blade had just been freshly oiled and it literally glistened in the dim light it was every bit as razorsharp as the day it had been consecrated eight hundred years ago at the zenith of samurai metallurgy guess noda knew a prize when he saw it and this katana was definitely a oneofakind piecean old sword koto from the sanjo branch of the yamashiro school of swordsmiths late heian signed by munechika said to have fashioned samurai swords for the shogun minamoto yoritomo himself the man who destroyed the imperial forces at dannoura no wonder noda had treated it with special reverence welcome i held it up why do you suppose he put it in here she was admiring it too you know i think i understand but its the kind of thing that cant be explained in words well at least youve got it back again samsons hair are you pleased maybe noda was trying to tell me something send a message but now im going to send one back do you really think she was already ahead of me guess were about to find out i bowed to the blade ritually then to the necs headhigh main processor from the first shogun to the last this i muttered silently is for amy her answer noda san the great masters of swordsmanship all will tell you something very ironic if you train for years and years all your moves eventually become instinctive you literally no longer know what you are doing you become oblivious of your mind as unknowing consciously of technique as the day you started thus the greatest masters and the rankest beginners actually share something very similar both are totally unaware of technique was i closer to the mindless beginner or the no mind master friends thats one confession youll need medieval torture to extract i will however admit to thinking about which stroke to use there are several that might have done the job of them all though the kesa seemed best for some reason it slices diagonally from the left shoulder down and across to the right and a swordsman pure in spirit can literally bisect a man slice him right in half as the blade sang through the cold and struck with a ring true as a bell i felt nothing thought nothing the hexagonal computation unit standing in front of us wasnt halved not even close but it was severely disoriented i felt a small tingle in my fingertips as the sword sailed through the outer steel casing and severed its first layer of silicon neurons sending forth a shower of sparks it wasnt dead but then the sword had some backup there is a long tradition in japanese culture of cooperation support from others for example in seppuku the ritual disembowelment sometimes called harakiri there is always a second participant who stands behind you and ceremonially lops off your head as your body topples forward it is an honored assignment my action may have been satisfying symbolically but it wouldnt do the job alone fortunately it didnt have to there was one simple way to disengage nodas electronic brain now and forever tam didnt even hesitate for a second there it could have been the fourth of july an uzi blasting away in the dark is a marvel i watched spellbound as she emptied about twenty rounds into the processor bank as well as into everything else in sight continuing until smoke started to pour out of the flooring below followed by the crackle of electrical shorting then several storage modules began to arc their high voltage mating in midair in moments nodas nec supercomputer was transformed into a shorting sputtering junk heap after that electrical fires erupted down below and the linoleum squares beneath our feet proceeded to heat and buckle next something flashed somewhere in the dark and a stack of computer printouts lying next to the door burst into flame originally id planned to retrieve the blade but then i reflected a second and decided just to leave it the sword in the supercomputer a sixfigure gesture maybe but one worth every penny in satisfaction noda would definitely understand by the time we made our way back through the shattered glass doorway picking a path among the splinters the fire was already spreading to the main office lets get out of here tam was still grasping the uzi not so fast i reached for the grip you dont get to have all the fun how do you operate this thing just pull there she pointed then raised the muzzle careful you might need that foot someday i lifted it up and it coughed a burst of flame the water cooler outside my office exploded uh i think you have to be chuck norris to do it like that on a scale of one to ten that round scores down in the fractions better aim spoilsport but i did i took critical bead on a leering green monitor squeezed and felt a light kick from the metal stock out blinked one of the dying monsters eyes then i methodically took out half a dozen more workstations just for the hell of it automatic weapons fire can be great therapy not to mention fun okay for a beginner matt she was pointing at the desk of nodas secretary a phone light had just flashed on hes calling in reinforcements time to make our notsograceful exit bring the automatic youve got it and uh im a little embarrassed to ask you for money but would you mind grabbing your purse we may need it youre now broke right she dashed for her office so were told i was wrapping the uzi in some computer printouts that hadnt yet caught fire the place was really starting to blaze thanks to all the paper smoke everywhere while she was coming back i decided to go over and kick the desk away from nodas door sure it was a risk but we couldnt let him burn to death or mori besides we were home free with the nec supercomputer blown to pieces as well as jim bob there was absolutely no way noda could cancel that stack of buy orders wed seeded all around the globe nothing could stop the bomb as we made our way through security we saw mori coming out of the office choking through the smoke and looking crazed as ever apparently the battle of dannoura twentiethcentury style was still raging then noda appeared in the doorway behind her and just stood there surveying the blazing ruins of his empire with his customary discipline he appeared totally unperturbed by it all not her though she lunged for the remains of the computer room now billowing smoke and tongues of fire the last thing on her mind apparently was us which was just as well because the second we hit the hallway we heard the elevator chime it had to be nodas backup forces without a word we both ducked for the stairwell and as the metal door slammed behind us tanaka and a host of armed dni security guards poured off the elevator like gangbusters turns out thered been a small army poised downstairs just in case they could have the place what was left of it my last memory of that office was a raging torrent of smoke and flame nothing remained this had to be the grand finale for dai nippon and matsuo noda the end finis barring unforeseen developments chapter thirty when we emerged into the lobby calmly as we could muster fire engines were racing up outside cops were crowded around the elevators and eddie was so frantic yelling about the holocaust up on eleven he didnt even bother to say hello we searched in vain for henderson as we worked our way through the milling throng headed for the pay phone in the corner bill had to be somewhere nobody else would have blacked out the dni offices my first thought though was that we needed to make tracks the brouhaha to come would best be handled from the safety of a foreign shore fortunately in my pocket was just enough change for one call and as luck would have it our man was in sure matt no problem but this is damned sudden right now patrick and hurry could be the perfect moment for an extended vacation how about just sending the car around over on third near that japanese place you told me you work for worked for patrick no more just got laid off hell i know where they are its all over the tube im sitting here right now watching jack odonnell blow his stack at a press briefing down in dc wish you could see the guy its live on cnn is this thing for real what was that dai nippon outfit trying to do buy up every incredible henderson had really come through patrick yeah fill you in on all the details over a drink someday right now though we could really use charlie and the car asap well be waiting outside we i looked at the smokesmeared woman standing beside me truthfully im hoping for some company tam smiled then reached out and took my hand not a word about strictly business okay matt charlie just walked in ill send him straight on over thanks a million owe you a big one as we moved on out through the revolving doors we finally spotted henderson wearing his gray topcoat and mingled in among the crowd on the sidewalk the lowest of low profiles for a second i almost didnt recognize the man he looked a wreck standing there shading his eyes and squinting up then i followed his gaze and realized smoke was pouring out of the windows on eleven seems wed demolished a little exterior plate glass too along with everything else bill i signaled over here walton thank god he waved and pushed our way i was worried stiff you two might still be up there what in hell happened did you just blow up long story there was a small war a new one and an old one but howd you get here noda said he was having your place watched a couple of yeah i saw those two apes they were in my lobby in handcuffs being grilled by new yorks finest when i came through our doorman figured they were casing us for a robbery and called the cops whats noda thinki live in a fucking tent i pay for top security friend the best anyway nice work with the lights much appreciated the bad news is you might want to get out of town for a while maybe go skiing someplace the whole thing fell apart noda just brought in a whole new load of funding hell i figured that out the minute i saw the times lying there outside my door only one place the market could be getting this kind of dough tokyo pension funds so i went back in and called jack you made the right move tipping him off maybe he can get trading shut down stop it somehow we stopped it ourselves tam interjected then indicated the paper bundle in her hands black metal stock protruding out of one corner god almighty he stared around at the policemen racing by walkietalkies chattering wheres jim bob i got a good mind to your hotshot screwed us bill noda got to him and bought him off i figured that out too little fucker he grimaced guess i trained him too well he didnt deserve his payoff somebodyd better hustle a medic up there fast let them take care of it he thumbed at the firemen piling off their trucks then bent over and pecked tam on the cheek well professor its been short and sweet keep em honest he reached for my hand walton you know how i hate to travel on short notice but considering the situation st moritz might be nice for a while drink some pear william for us will do best of luck same to you i watched him flip up the collar on his coat as he turned oh by the way bill one last thing yeah he glanced back want a little insider information wouldnt dream of listening he returned like a shot might not be a bad idea to short every hightech stock dni currently holds theres a finite possibility all hells going to break loose at the opening tomorrow whats the story he was all ears tam turned to me are you finally going to explain what that scam with jim bob was all about well now theres some time what i did was sucker him into posting buy orders for an additional five percent of every company on your kill list im well aware of that she just continued to stare which means that when the sec reports those holdings itll trigger the new provisions their majority stockholder with whose power of attorney i acted with full legal authorityvoted last week which was its a little like whats being called a tin parachute these days the latest twist on the antitakeover poison pill isnt that where managements have their boards vote that a hostile buyout will trigger big disbursements of a companys assets to the rank and file whats that got to do with thats the play great takeover defense by the way but noda had already taken those companies over she frowned puzzling right obviously nobodys supposed to institute one after a takeover but thats what dai nippon voted to do last wednesday and thursday for every company it owns the way its set up now if the majority stockholder in any of those companies which just happens to be dni acquires another four percent or more all that stockholders stock is automatically disbursed to the employees just like that fully legal like a tin parachute but what will let me finish in my version therere some strings attached the money cant be used to just go out and buy toyotas i arranged it so that all the stock will be held in escrow for ten years and used as collateral for loans specially earmarked to finance expansion and r and d in other words the employees are about to become those companies new bank partner what in holy hell are you talking about henderson appeared to have just entered shock his bloodshot eyes were like saucers nodas piece of those hightech outfits is just going to be given to the troops then locked up as security for new financing bill try and think of it as a different kind of restructuring that grand new corporate scam but instead of the standard ripoff where managers entrench themselves by loading up a company with debt and bribing their shareholders with the money i turned the whole thing upside down gave the control of those companies to their workers wholl now have a stake in dividends and profits walton you idiot stock prices for those outfits are going to nosedive the second news of this hits the street itll scare the institutions shitless ive never heard anything so crazy who knows whatll happen let the supply side economists try and figure it out my guess is were about to find out if anybody here still believes in the working man in any case it cant make things worse and it should be great fun to watch at least american industry is about to be owned by the people who punch the time clocks maybe working for ourselves instead of investment bankers will help things get rolling again i dont believe you did this tam fell against me laughing do you realize what it really means nodas totally destroyed hell have to sell off that new portfolio of blue chips just to have enough profit to cover the claims of his original eighthundredyearfund investors after this no japanese money manager is going to give him a yen hes history bushido when you break the rules things like that can happen jesus im not going to screw around short selling im just gonna load up on puts before the opening tomorrow you oughta do the same walton when the street gets wind of this and all those stocks crater you could clear millions bill headed briskly up the avenue stay well we watched him disappear into the crowd then started searching for charlie morgan and the car incidentally the recipient of that phone call wasnt really named patrick since there are laws about smuggling firearms in and out of countries and we damned well were going to take along the uzi it seems only right to give him a pseudonym his charter outfit which works out of that hangar off to the side of the majors at kennedy keeps a lear that can make the caribbean in one hop if its not too full he even picks you up in a limo his comeon for the carriage trade about ten minutes later we saw charlie working the rolls around all the fire engines doubleparked on third and waving for us good to see you again matt he glanced back as we settled in christ you two look terrible were you up there just left must have been a hell of a fire from the looks of it he hit the gas and made a right turn where to straight down fifth to your place one quick stop first over on west seventyeighth the west side in this traffic come on matt i still havent had lunch just cut through central park should be a snap while he and tam waited outside the west side free school i went in to try and kidnap amy it wasnt easy i finally explained to ms winters that my daughters christmas vacation had merely been delayed a little this year but better late than never after some haggling we struck a deal on homework then in a limo piled high with school books class projects lunch boxes and a black israeli uzi we headed downtown dad youve gone nuts my only offspring was in heaven honey were going to snorkel for two weeks solid think you can stand the old man for that long can we have a christmas tree you promised ill cut it myself and a christmas party too might have to call it something else but i suppose we can give it a try if you keep up on the homework i looked at her failing as usual to understand the movements of her mind sweetie why do you want to throw a party this is supposed to be a vacation dad really dont you remember that neat boy from sweden whose parents have that house across the bay he was teaching me windsurfing last summer hes in junior year now but if hes there weve got to have a party dont you understand guess well have a party what can you do nobody said youre supposed to win them all bad news or maybe it was good news travels with amazing speed in this day and age the late edition of the tuesday new york post found its way to the caribbean on an evening flight and since it took us a while to get out of town it actually reached the virgin islands shortly before we did however since we flew directly into st croix instead of the main island of st thomas we missed the delivery as it happened though an old acquaintance was passing the house that night on a personal mission and he was kind enough to drop off rupert murdochs tuesday contribution to journalism the time was around ten pm amy was sound asleep conked out from twilight windsurfing and tam and i were working on a pitcher of planters punch by the pool when there came the sound of honking out front i went in and unlocked the entry then peeked out to see who it was the red white and blue jeep belonged to none other than artie wilson dressed to the nines walton my man you done gone and got yourself famous he grinned with delight then threw a rolledup newspaper toward the door tole you itd be yo ass artie what in hell turn that thing off and come in for a drink somebody i want you to meet hey late for a reception at that new place down the beach think all them hot new york divorcees jus come down here for nothing but sunshine an vitamin d gotta keep the tourists satisfied he revved his engine and began backing out of the drive tomorrow maybe feds aint nailed yo honkie butt by then with which enigmatic pronouncement he sped into the humid night i picked up the bundle then snapped on the yard lights and strolled back out where tam was sitting still wearing her pool robe what was artie talking about as i settled down beside her and unrolled the paper staring back at us from the front page were two very familiar faces off one of my book jackets she said i never much cared for it mines from their photo morgue during some takeover circus guess we should have been keeping closer tabs on the news seems that matsuo noda president of dai nippon int had held a press conference midafternoon tuesday to refute all the misinformation being spread by senator jack odonnell as he claimed it was actually two americans former employees of dni who had been responsible for dai nippons secret hostile takeover of the uss largest corporations he made this point to dispute senator odonnells assertion that they had been the ones whod stopped it see photo page he went on to apologize for what apparently had been a severe communications mixup within dni which brought about this unauthorized action and he was pleased to report he personally had taken steps to terminate the buyup this very morning as of am run that whopper by jacks subcommittee nodasan there was more seems the body of an unidentified maleyoung caucasian and badly burnedhad been recovered by firemen on the eleventh floor of dnis offices noda had no idea who this person was perhaps a misfortunate prowler matt look she was pointing at a paragraph on the lower half of the page thered been a second casualty although not as serious the wellknown japanese financial commentator akira mori had been borne unconscious from the premises acute smoke inhalation as of press time she was in intensive care at mt sinai hospital we saw her come out of the office it was pretty smoky by then but how could the answer followed firemen reportedly had discovered her in the computer room near the mainframes burnedout storage banks speculation was she had been attempting to save the hard disks the vital dni files mori wasnt trying to save anything tam tossed down the paper she wanted to make sure all the disks were destroyed to protect the emperor from a scandal over nodas sword hoax another victim for the imperial sword i looked up at the starry sky a mosaic of silver and black as the milky way floated above us the night air was symphonic with the sound of crickets how many more then she retrieved the post and we finished the item after nodas prepared statement thered been a q ampaduring which he reaffirmed his intention to use all available means to block senator odonnells subpoena of dnis remaining records an action he declared confiscatory and groundless privileged information etc he did however manage to wrap things up on a forward looking note todays unfortunate indeed tragic accidental fire should be understood as merely a momentary setback nothing that had happened would in any way diminish his program of capital infusion and openmarket acquisition in americas hightech sector wall street need not worry senator odonnells harassment notwithstanding dai nippons money was here to stay we were now partners his grand new alliance nipponica would shape the world to come thats what he thinks she laughed wait till he wakes up tomorrow and discovers he just donated all his hightech acquisitions to their employees dont think that fits the big strategy one thing though americas overpaid golfplaying senior executives could have some wild and woolly board meetings ahead lifes full of surprises i pulled her over and slipped my arm around and the biggest one for me this week at least has been you she turned and kissed me softly on the mouth then again my heart skipped whereupon she abruptly rose and dove headfirst into the pool without her suit looked to be a second chance coming up this year for us all afterword contemporary tales of technology and economics engage a moving target which
